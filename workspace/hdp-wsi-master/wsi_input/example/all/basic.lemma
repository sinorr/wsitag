The Chinese Government has always respected the international community 's universal principle on human rights and has actively worked to promote and protect the Chinese people 's human rights and basic freedoms , and tremendous results that have drawn worldwide attention have been achieved .  
In the new situation and in face of new challenges , we should have a firm grip of the party 's basic line of taking economic construction as a center , seize chances , quicken the tempo of development , exert ourselves to make the country prosperous , and immerse ourselves into hard work .  Only by so doing will we be able to narrow our gap with developed countries .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out the practice in opposing corruption in recent years has fully proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership system , and work mechanism for opposing corruption laid down since the 14th Party Congress by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core are completely correct , and we have formed a number of important understandings , accumulated some valuable experiences , and initially explored a road for effectively unfolding the anticorruption struggle suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Zeng Jianhui , member of the NPC standing committee and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee , said : " China has always acknowledged and respected the universal principles of human rights of the international community , committed itself to the promotion and protection of the human rights and basic liberties of its citizens in accordance with its national conditions , and actively facilitated dialogue , exchange , and cooperation in the area of human rights in the international community . "  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Of these figures , the NPC and its standing committee have , since the ninth congress , formulated a total of nearly 60 laws and law-related decisions and most of the basic and principal laws of the seven branches of law that make up the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics have been enacted .  
Firstly , it requires party committees and leading cadres with party membership at all levels to further enhance their ideological understanding , fully recognize the superiority of this basic political system of our country , gain a deep understanding of the distinct features of China 's political party system , study and acquire knowledge of the glorious history of our party cooperating with democratic parties , and enhance their consciousness in cooperating with democratic parties .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
Deputy Caiwang Bandian , commissioner of the Administrative Office of the Nyingchi Prefecture , indicated : Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , based on Tibet 's practical conditions , the central authorities have held three work conferences on Tibet ; helped Tibet get its idea on economic and social development into shape ; and have built up a number of basic facilities for the development of communication , energy , telecommunications , as well as agriculture and animal husbandry .  
Delegate Yao Qiong , Chairwoman of the Women 's Federation from the Daozhengelao minority autonomous county , proposed expansion of educational forces on behalf of national minorities in impoverished areas , increasing support for a new round of development in the area of poverty relief , strengthening cadre training at basic levels in rural areas , and promoting the overall development of rural economies .  
Although we have established a basic and preliminary framework for the socialist market economic structure , it has yet to be gradually improved .  In particular , the tasks for readjusting and improving the ownership structure and establishing and perfecting the market system will be rather arduous .  
The basic laws were formulated by the supreme legislative organ of the country in accordance with the Constitution . They are country-wide laws embodying the guiding principle and policy of " one country , two systems . "  The status of basic laws is higher than all the other local laws in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions .  
As Hong Kong and Macao had experienced long-time colonial rules , to comprehensively and accurately implement the basic laws , it should need a process .  It is necessary for us to make long-term efforts and , on the basis of loving the country and Hong Kong , jointly unite the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to strive for creating a kind of social environment which is favorable to implementing and fulfilling the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and the basic laws .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
At the same time , the proposal of these policy principles is very practicable .  For example , with respect to protecting and improving grain production capability , the ' outline ' stipulates strict execution of the basic agricultural land protection system , maintaining a dynamic equilibrium in the total amount of land under cultivation in the nation , and ensuring that by 2005 the total area of land under cultivation will not be less than 128 million hectares .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
They should see to a sound implementation of the relevant principles and policies adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council ; and ensure that both the minimum subsistence guarantee allowances for urban residents and the basic old-age pension for retirees can be issued at the scheduled time and in full amount without any delay , and ensure that the two kinds of pensions can increase in a rational way along with the country 's economic growth .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
This issue must be stressed here because this is the fundamental purpose of our economic development and also the basic requirement of the cardinal principles pursued by our party and government .  Under the current situation , this is also an issue worth special attention .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
It is necessary to adhere to the basic economic system where public ownership is the main form of ownership and various sectors under diverse forms of ownership can develop together .  In accordance with the requirement of entering some areas while pulling out of others , we should let the state sector gravitate toward important industries and key fields that affect the lifeline of the national economy and further strengthen the control and dominance of the state sector in the national economy through the rational flow and optimized disposition of assets .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
In conformity with the requirements for WTO accession , " local content , " " export performance " and other stipulations that are inconsistent with WTO rules will be removed from this basic law for foreign investment which paved the way for the rush of foreign investors into the country .  The present amendment is the biggest move made by China to date in its review and revision of foreign-related laws and regulations in anticipation of WTO accession .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
" Being small but highly trained , economical , legitimate , and highly efficient should be the basic norm guiding our efforts in building a modern government , said member Yang Haikun , who added : It is true that we have seen everywhere phenomena like over-staffed institutions , redundant personnel , overlapped functions , or misplaced roles .  
The second is that the means of management are different .  The reemployment service centers of enterprises are in charge of the workers of the state-owned-enterprises who are removed from their work place , including the issuance of basic living expenses and paying of social insurance fees on behalf of the workers ; whereas socialized management is applied to the unemployed personnel .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Proceeding from this , we have decided on the basic line of " one center and two basic points , " and drawn up the basic economic , political , and cultural outline for building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and a whole series of guidelines and policies suited to our actual conditions ; as a result China has stood firm amid the constantly changing international situation , and achieved successes acknowledged by the whole world , advancing from victory to new victory .  
The CPPCC organizations at all levels should continue to carry out the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and the eight-point proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin , actively promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel visits , strive to unite all internal and external forces that can be united , resolutely oppose any attempt to split the motherland , and make contributions to accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland .  
Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .  
The basic old-age pension , basic medical care , and unemployment insurance for urban workers as well as the minimum subsistence guarantee system for urban residents will be further improved and perfected , and the registered unemployment rate in urban areas will be controlled below 5 percent .  
The current constitution in Japan was promulgated in November 1946 and implemented starting from May 1947 .  The fundamental idea of the constitution is to forfeit warfare , and support the idea of people having the right to make their own decisions , in addition to guaranteeing the basic human rights .  
Fifth , the structure of the personnel training will be adjusted .  While basic education is consolidated , high school education and tertiary education will be developed greatly .  The rate of tertiary education receivers in Henan Province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
This session held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , upheld the party 's basic line , comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and discussed the major strategic , macro , and policy issues facing China in entering a new stage of development in comprehensively building a comfortably well-off society and speeding up socialist modernization .  
The session holds that the summary of the work for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period contained in the Outline and Report is based on facts , while the targets , guiding principles , and main tasks set forth for the next five years ' work of economic and social development conform to the basic interests of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  They reflect the development of the times and the requirements of our modernization cause and can be realized through our efforts .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
What is different from the previous plans is that the 10th Five-Year Plan regards raising the living standard of the broad masses as a basic point of departure .  It embodies the alignment of national planning with the people 's livelihood and is a plan that fully reflects General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents . "  
Since the second half of 1998 , under the leadership of the party central committee and the State Council , the State Development Planning Commission started to organize personnel to make preliminary preparations and conduct investigation and study for the formulation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which included more than 140 special subjects totaling as many as five million words and covered such contents as the basic judgment on the domestic and international environments , the principal development targets , the basic strategic choices , the main considerations about policies , and so on .  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
" As textbook is one of the resources to support teaching , its content should be impartial and factually correct to facilitate training of independent thinking and analytical skills amongst students .  " Thus , in December 1995 , basic principles and examples from a number of subjects were given to textbook publishers associations on textbook revision .  Those basic principles included ' revision should be kept to the minimum and complete revision of textbooks should be avoided ' .  
Looking into the future , the Financial Secretary was full of confidence .  With a sound and stable economic foundation for the HKSAR and a favourable environment under the " one country , two systems " concept , coupled with the ever-increasing economic cooperation with the Mainland after the reunification with the motherland , he believed that mutual understanding would be promoted and that more opportunity would be created for cooperation for mutual benefits under the basic principle of " one country , two systems " .  
With a sound and stable economic foundation for the HKSAR and a favourable environment under the " one country , two systems " concept , coupled with the ever increasing economic cooperation with the Mainland after the reunification with the motherland , we will be able to promote our mutual understanding and create more opportunity for cooperation for our mutual benefits under the basic principle of " one country , two systems " .  
Announcing this today ( Sunday ) , a DH spokesman said : " Applicants for nursing home care must be elderly persons aged 65 or above who are suffering from one or more medical conditions that are stabilised but which have caused functional disability and loss of personal care ability , and who require regular and basic medical and nursing care . "

" The phased increases in the basic rental for residential lines in accordance with the Framework Agreement are intended to provide a level playing field for local fixed telecommunications network service operators by allowing CWHKT to gradually eliminate the cross-subsidy from revenues from international services , " added the spokesman .  
If CWHKT 's basic rental charge remains substantially below cost , which will still be slightly below cost after the increase , other local operators , whose costs are comparable to CWHKT 's , will find it difficult to offer competitive alternative services to the residential market without suffering a loss .  Ultimately , consumers will suffer because of the lack of a truly competitive market , " the spokesman said .  
Police officers today registered the serial numbers marked on the tamper-resistant labels posted on each of some 500 bicycles the owners of which are participating in the scheme .

Chief Secretary : Let me stress again that we have no fixed timetable for legislating on Article 23 .  We realize that it is an extremely controversial and sensitive issue .  We are still doing some basic research and when we are ready , we will do extensive consultations so that at the end of the day hopefully we will have a consensus as to how to move forward on this very very controversial subject .  Thank you .

( b ) We have reasons to believe that those who use forged ( green cards ) are mostly illegal workers .  This is because a worker may be issued a ( green card ) on the same day after completing a one-day basic safety training course and passing a test .

Our objective is to develop an adequate but sustainable social safety net that provides financial assistance to our needy elders to meet their basic needs .  
1 .  High-stake public examination for the purpose of allocating S1 places is not necessary during the nine years of free and universal basic education .  Empirical evidence has proven that selection-oriented public assessments , even if they are not intended to require prior preparation , would inevitably hamper students ' learning experience and make primary education examination-driven .  This would in turn hinder the all-round development of students ; and

As we proceed to take forward the proposed new housing policies to mesh with other wider changes that are now taking place , it remains our firm belief that the overarching objective of our public housing policies should be to satisfy the society 's basic housing needs .  Home ownership should be a matter for the market with which Government should refrain from competing .  A clear , comprehensive and coherent housing strategy is instrumental in restoring public 's confidence in the property market .

In the Chinese history , the Qin and Han dynasties were crucial eras which marked the emergence of China 's basic territorial boundaries , the establishment of the first government of central administration and a unified empire , the expansion of communications with the West , and the development of production technologies .  In the 2,200 years from the establishment of governance systems in those two dynasties to the period immediately before the Revolution of 1911 , China developed steadily on a set trail politically , socially , economically and culturally .  
In relation to broadcasting , the television and radio Codes of Practice issued by the Broadcasting Authority require licensees to observe at all times certain basic standards in the presentation of programmes , including news broadcasts .  A licensee should not include in its programmes any material that is indecent , obscene , or of bad taste and which is not acceptable to ordinary viewers .  
Specifically , we will review our social security schemes to ensure a basic safety net for needy elders and people with disabilities , assist the unemployed and the needy to tide over their short term financial difficulties , adopt more vigorous and rational gate-keeping for access to services based on defined need , and re-engineer services to strengthen integration and networking .  
" In view of the heavy demand for temporary accommodation among health care staff due to various reasons , the Government has been working hard to identify suitable buildings and fitting them with basic facilities to enable our exhausted health care staff to have a decent place , as an alternative to their home , to take a well-earned rest between shifts and after duty .  
( a ) One of the aims of the GS curriculum is to enable students to maintain healthy personal development to help them develop a healthy lifestyle .  Through the study of GS , students can acquire some basic understanding of the physical , psychological and social aspects of health , possess a positive attitude towards their personal growth and development , and make informed decisions related to their health and safety .  
Of the approved provision , $ 450 million would be made available for application by local researchers and research institutes from the public , private and academic sectors for projects covering research on etiology , surveillance and epidemiology of infectious diseases , public health , basic , clinical and health service research , and funding of institutions to enhance research infrastructure . 
The blast furnace , considered as the ' heart ' of entire mill complex , will be in continuous round-the-clock operation for as long as five consecutive years . Ore sinters , limestone and other ingredients will be melted in the furnace then carried forward to the basic oxygen furnace , where they will be turned into liquid steel ready to cast billets and slabs on the production line .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
After Shen Neng , another important contribution was made by Huang Ti ( the legendary Yellow Emperor ) who is said to have lived 46 centuries ago . The Nei Chin , a classic on Chinese herbal medicine was written on the basis of the catechism on medical science worked out by the emperor and an aide . This is also an important book in research into the basic ideology of traditional Chinese medicine .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
Good sails should be able to adjust to the force and directional changes of the wind . Besides these basic tools of the game , the student should also remember a life jacket , wet suit , and protective shoes , a total expense of over US $ 1,000 . In light of the island 's ever expanding economic situation , this does not pose a great burden . The past two years has seen a rapid growth in wind surfing .  
Ricebowls must be compact , easy to hold attractive , and not burn the hands that hold them . Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf . Put simply , industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use , requiring a minimum of human effort .  
But the concern today is that among the competing claims of salon , nature , conceptual , documentary , and other schools , photographers may become lost between empty formalism and blind conceptualism and that the basic nature of photography may be forgotten - - the pure , direct , and honest observation and recording of reality .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
As well as texts , each entry in the work also comprises basic biographical information concerning the author ; complete bibliographical information concerning the first edition of the work ; a summary of the content , analysis or appraisal of the work ; and references to contemporary reviews , secondary works and translations into English .  
Overriding individual divergences , the skulls all share the features of rather developed cheekbones , flat noses , narrow nasal cavities , sloped foreheads , broad flat faces , and shovel-shaped incisors , all basic Mongoloid characteristics .  
" The real issue is whether agency heads have the determination and guts to exercise their assessment responsibilities , " points out Hsu Yu-fu . The basic status of civil servants is guaranteed by law and they can not be cashiered lightly ; meanwhile those dismissed with a " D " grading will lose their pension entitlement , so departmental heads shrink from drastic action from sympathetic considerations and to avoid a backlash , which , means there is no effective way of weeding out unsuitable personnel . "  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
The roots of a big tree : To place its scientific development on a firm footing in the world , Taiwan has to putting down roots in applied science first as a strategic choice . But Li Tai-feng warns that " a country that has become industrially and commercially developed only recently is liable to overemphasize practical applications and neglect basic research . "  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
An IQ of from 50 to 70 is considered mildly retarded ; the focus of education is similar to that of ordinary children , with more emphasis on practical applied learning . People with IQs from 35 to 50 are classified as moderately retarded , with the focus of education placed on taking care of one 's own daily necessities , communication with others , developing job skills , and basic knowledge .  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
Taoist doctrine was originally developed from the thinking of the Taoist masters . These masters actually preached passive inaction and following nature , but Taoist doctrine turned this basic naturalism into a different kind of reasoning which affirmed that various " natural " methods , such as alchemy and controlled breathing , could actually resist the limitations of nature and extend life without limitation .  
The main characters in these dramas were mostly country girls , women vendors , or actresses in dramatic troupes . The trademark Hsinhua film was a common love story built around these leading characters . Production was simple , and performance techniques were based on traditional Chinese opera or the singing techniques of folk songs . To these were added clever , catchy songs by the basic team of Yao Min , who wrote the music , Chen Tieh-yi , who composed the lyrics , and Yao Li , who sang the vocals offstage .  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
Finding an heir in a test tube : Even though Taiwan 's in vitro fertilization technology has reached an international standard , Liu Chi-hung feels concern that little attention is paid within the country to basic research . " Everyone is only anxious to study the procedures , without researching the underlying reasons . They just understand the superficial results ; when they run into problems , they 're lost at sea . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Give future scholars opportunities to do research , " One enjoys an antique , generally speaking , by admiring fine workmanship , a well-reasoned structure , the luster and grain of beautiful wood . Is it of magnificent appearance , at once stately and full of energy ? Is the workmanship of its embellishments wise - - outstanding without overwhelming its basic shape ? Are its lines smooth and pleasing to the eye ?  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom . " For instance , it made us loyal and sincere , hard working , persevering . . . I hope my child has learned these traits in addition to a basic understanding of morality . "  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
When employers cut and runThe method of calculating severance pay is that workers are entitled to receive one month 's average wages for each full year worked . So-called " average wages " is the average amount of money earned over the previous six months , including basic salary , overtime pay , and fixed subsidies .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
Under the assimilation policy , the Japanese issued the Taiwan education law , eliminated differential education , implemented the common study system , recognized improperly documented marriages , set basic principles for internal governance , and more .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
In his History of Chinese Food Science , writer Hong Guang-zhu notes that the Chinese have long believed that flavors can be divided into five basic simple types : salty , sour , bitter , pungent and sweet .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
" When we look at things from the perspective of the fairy realm , that is to say on a large scale , the smaller scale of the mortal world becomes unimportant , " says Ke Ching-ming . He feels that imagining fairy realms is a way of observing the basic nature of the world from a unusual angle , in order to defuse problems . It provides a relativistic perspective , breaking down blind insistence on the absolute nature of values , and this enables humans to be more relaxed and natural in many ways .  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations . I was born and raised in Taiwan , and all my family and assets are here in Taiwan . My fate is linked to the fate of the vast majority of Taiwan 's people . I think this is the basic reason why the DPP is better positioned to deal with cross-strait relations than the KMT .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .

" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,

The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Phase 1 contains basic gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices , broken down by final expenditure and kind of economic activity .  
The experience of his country and others which had introduced basic economic reforms in tandem with systemic reforms confirmed that the successful pursuit of sustainable growth required that individuals be given the opportunity to be the active agents of change , that they must enjoy basic human rights and freedoms and that entrepreneurship should be encouraged .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .

Respect for fundamental human rights was deeply embedded in what was called the " Pacific way " , a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that meant that respect for the basic rights of all came naturally to the peoples of the Pacific islands and that it was natural for them to seek out dialogue , in other words , to practice democracy , a fact of which they were quite proud .  
A single , integrated international database containing extensive basic statistics and indicators covering a wide range of topics in these fields is being developed for wide dissemination pending the provision of extrabudgetary support .  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,

While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
" Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , " Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .

( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara .

The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan , which has become a basic strategic principle of its foreign policy , is the most acceptable approach for Turkmenistan in pursuing its national interests and is in keeping with the country 's historical , geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities .  
UNICEF 's multifaceted activities have included the massive struggle waged to control the menace of epidemic diseases in the 1950s ; efforts to integrate children 's needs into the overall development agenda in the 1960s ; the commitment to provide basic social services to children in the 1970s ; the campaign for child survival and development in the 1980s ; and , in the closing decade of this century , efforts to support Governments in ensuring the protection of the rights of children , in particular those in especially difficult circumstances .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;

As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
In order to deal more effectively with juvenile delinquency , the French Government has launched the urban recovery pact , which includes a set of new judicial measures coordinated around three basic aims : speeding up the course of penal justice for minors , diversifying educational measures and improving the consistency of juvenile delinquency prevention measures . 
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
The logic of the Charter is today made manifest as United Nations support for democratization helps to prevent aggression and to foster the construction and maintenance of viable and independent States as the basic guarantors of human rights , the basic mechanisms for solving national problems and the basic elements of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
The concept of health security encompasses all aspects of the basic rights to health : the right to freedom of choice and personal security ; the right to food in sufficient quantity and quality ; the right to live and work in environments where known health risks are controlled ; and the right to have access to education , information and decent housing .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
It is beyond all doubt that a consistent implementation of all articles of the Dayton Agreement is crucial to the prospects for a normally functioning , democratic State capable of ensuring the basic social , legal , security and other conditions for everybody .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
Their tenuous situation has frequently been exacerbated as special programmes to promote their participation in the labour force and as basic services and social safety nets have been weakened or dismantled in order to meet strict budgetary requirements .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,

The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
It agreed that the term " national forest programme " is a generic term for a wide range of approaches to sustainable forest management within different countries , to be applied at national and subnational levels based on the basic principles outlined below .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
There are departmental directors in the nine regions and each of the main police stations is now headed by a commissaire ; salaries are paid more regularly ; many stations have received basic equipment ; radio links have been established between departmental headquarters and HNP headquarters in Port-au-Prince ; and cooperation with the judiciary has improved .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs .

The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .

An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
Mr . van Boven was requested to submit , without financial implications , in time for the Sub _ Commission 's consideration at its forty _ eighth session , a revised set of proposed basic principles and guidelines on remedies in the light of existing relevant international instruments , taking into account the new comments received from States and intergovernmental organizations and non _ governmental organizations , as well as the relevant sections of the report of the working group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation .

The section prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex , race , colour , nationality , religion , political opinion , social or family status or other similar circumstances .  Notwithstanding the fact that this principle was , before the Act entered into effect , considered to be one of the unwritten basic principles of administrative law , it was deemed necessary to enact an express provision to this effect .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
The working group of the Commission on Human Rights which was engaged in the elaboration of a draft optional protocol to the Convention intended to establish a preventive system of visits to places of detention was endeavouring to reconcile various national positions while maintaining intact the basic principles of regular and ad hoc visits to detention centres , participation of experts in missions and the integrity of the text to be adopted .  
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
These UNESCO Chairs play an active role in upgrading the knowledge of basic values of human rights , democracy and peace at the university level and at the same time serve as focal points for promoting education for peace , tolerance and international understanding at all educational levels .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The outcome of our recently held parliamentary elections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our foreign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by the overwhelming majority of the Polish people . 
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Mr . Wilmot ( Ghana ) : The World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen in August 1995 , brought into sharp focus the profound nature of underdevelopment in the world and created a sense of urgency for mobilizing energies and resources at the national and international levels to implement strategies to eradicate poverty , promote full employment and foster social integration as a basic policy priority .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) : A few days ago in the Third Committee , we had the privilege of a highly stimulating and thought-provoking introduction by Mr . Nitin Desai , Under-Secretary-General for the newly constituted Department of Economic and Social Affairs , on the basic issues bearing on economic and social development facing the international community at the present juncture .  
While India is forging ahead with its policy of economic reform and liberalization , public policy is being re-oriented towards supporting agricultural growth , building up infrastructure and ensuring universal access to basic minimum services like health , education , drinking water , food and nutrition , shelter and so on .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
Our efforts are focused on trying to establish a common market , within a gradual and continuous process in which the basic stages still need to be rounded off , improved and studied in depth .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The Centre for Family Friendly Cities of the University of Akron , Ohio , United States of America , created an interactive communications network on the World Wide Web designed to store , search and retrieve information on , inter alia , family relationships , sexuality and reproduction , special problems and risk factors , family counselling and education , cultural social and urban issues , basic needs , leisure and entertainment , consumption and sustainable development and work .  
As recently as 1995 , all the CIS countries shared one basic feature : precipitous and sweeping economic decline ( the two notable exceptions in 1995 were Armenia and Georgia , where GDP had grown a little after the nearly catastrophic collapse of previous years ) .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .  
People are being denied their basic rights ; their houses , shops , mosques , churches and synagogues are burned to the ground ; they are beaten up , maimed and even killed ; and all this in the name of an evil we call racism , which does not leave its victims alone even after they die : the number of cemeteries that are being desecrated is growing at a worrisome pace .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
Despite abject poverty in the slums surrounding the cities , living conditions are still considered preferable to those in rural areas , particularly with regard to access to water and the availability of basic services , such as health and education , as well as access to markets , which provides opportunities in the private sector .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .

Given the intrinsic link between human rights and development , the Hearing emphasized the need to promote respect for basic human rights , and noted that the right to development is a fundamental right that must be recognized , acknowledged , upheld and seen as an integral component of human rights .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .

The Minister explained , however , that , while the legislation in force in Cameroon since what was generally known as the Afreedoms session @ of the National Assembly ( 1990 ) guaranteed the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in various international and regional instruments , the task of creating a genuine human rights culture , not only among the forces of law and order but also among the public , still lay ahead . 
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,

However , in order to protect workers from employers who might attempt to impose harsh wage conditions or who might fail to pay workers a wage sufficient to meet their basic needs , the State has felt obliged to intervene in order to improve the living standards of workers and , consequently , contractual freedom is no longer absolute in the field of employment since the State has begun to intervene in order to protect workers , particularly in regard to wages .  
Due regard must also be paid to the need for consistency in classification , nomenclature , terminology and definitions and the committee 's minimum wage proposals must be based on those to which an average skilled and competent worker is entitled , without gender-based discrimination , in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and the need to ensure that the wage is sufficient to meet the worker 's basic needs .  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .

Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,

As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .

At the most critical and difficult time in our history , when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the socialist bloc collapsed , and with them the basic markets and sources of supply that the country could count on to withstand the ferocious economic warfare waged against an island only 90 miles from the United States coast , they decided to be yet more unyielding in their approach to Cuba : with truly vulgar and repugnant opportunism , the blockade was intensified to the maximum .  
The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
Equally important , they must promote and incorporate policies for universal access to basic and primary education , improved literacy , increased life expectancy , reduced infant and maternal mortality rates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to socially and economically productive lives .  
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
Nonetheless , the urgent appeal made by the Social Summit for emergency measures to address the very serious problems of poverty , unemployment , illiteracy and lack of basic medical care , among others which were , and continue to be , responsible for the increasing social marginalization in third-world societies was received with resolute hope . 
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Special mention should be made of our Bolivar 2000 plan , an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic to provide resources and professional and logistical capabilities from the armed forces to the population in order to establish an integrated social-service programme aimed , inter alia , at the provision of timely assistance to meet the peoples basic needs and at rehabilitating the social infrastructure .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .

Cairo + 5 is part of a series of international conferences that constitute fundamental elements for the advancement and improvement of the situation of mankind , and particularly that of women , who in many instances suffer major discrimination based on their gender and on historic , social and cultural beliefs that undermine their possibilities to advance and their basic right to occupy their due place in all aspects of social life on an equal footing with men .

The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom knows better than anyone else that the methods he has been employing in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are prompted by narrow political considerations inimical to Iraq and have played a large part in impeding implementation of the oil-for-food programme and in delaying the arrival of foodstuffs and basic necessities covered by the provisions of this programme .  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;

Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .

In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
For the state to set aside some fiscal revenue to ensure the basic living needs and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise workers is not only the demand of implementing the party 's program of wholehearted service for the people , but is also the requirement of creating and stable social environment for the continued development of reform and construction .

We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as the driving force ; and the principle of raising the people 's living standards as the basic starting point - - is aimed at promoting economic development and social progress in a comprehensive manner .  
Li Lanqing emphasized : The central policy for the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the reform of the medical and health system has been promulgated .  Various localities should seize the time to formulate concrete reform measures in accordance with local conditions and implement them accordingly .  
Li Lanqing stressed that to set up a framework of public finance , it is imperative to foster a new concept on financial management , and its basic ideas can be summarized in the following words : " Appropriate proportion , suitable centralization and decentralization , reasonable income and expenditure , and proper use of funds . "  
Today , all we 're doing , such as conducting economic construction , building spiritual civilization , building democracy , and building a legal system , are in the final analysis aimed at ensuring that the 1.2 billion Chinese people will live and work in peace and contentment and will fully enjoy all types of human rights and basic freedoms .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi expressed here today his appreciation for the efforts of US President Clinton in improving Sino-US ties during his presidency over the past eight years .  He said : So long as both Chinese and US leaders , especially US leaders , are able to regard Sino-US ties with a long-term and strategic viewpoint , to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques , and to fully understand the basic common interests between China and the United States , Sino-US ties will healthily and steadily advance forward in the new century .  
Chi Haotian said : China has attached great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Tunisia . China will adhere to the basic principle of " being sincere and friendly to each other , treating each other as equals , maintaining unity and cooperation , seeking common development , and facing the future , " and will jointly build a new long-term , stable , and comprehensive cooperative partnership with African countries to gear to the needs of the 21st century .

Li Lanqing expressed deep belief that full advancement of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is not only in keeping with the basic interests of the two countries and their people , but is also beneficial to regional and global peace and stability .  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  
On people engaged in business in the non-public sector of the economy , Jiang Zemin said : Upholding the basic economic system in which public ownership is dominant and diverse forms of ownership develop side by side is determined by the condition of our country - - the nature and primary stage of socialism .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Today , people 's consumption in both urban and rural areas has changed from " satisfying the basic needs for food and clothing " to improving the quality of life and seeking all-round individual development .  
There is also need to constantly secure and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front , bring into play the initiative and creativity of all social circles , and gather the wisdom and forces of the entire Chinese people .  Only in this way , will we succeed in our cause and achieve bigger victories .  This is a basic theory .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , which is putting into practice the guidelines laid down by the 15th CPC National Congress and the fifth plenary session of the 15th Central Committee , has defined the capital 's development strategy for the new century , taking Beijing 's actual conditions into account .  For the first step , namely in the period from now until 2010 , Beijing will basically achieve socialist modernization before other cities throughout the country , building up the basic framework of a modern international metropolis .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
To counter the problems that exist in management , many units , including the Central Enterprises Working Committee , the State Electric Power Corporation , and the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Holdings Corporation , have put forward measures for strengthening supervision over leading personnel of state-owned enterprises and establishing and improving basic business standards to provide a clearly defined work system and standard for each post .  This will not only solve the problems of quality and efficiency but also step up the building of a clean government .  
Finally , Zhang Zuoji said that actively promoting reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban and township professionals is also an important content for perfecting the social insurance system .  We must advance in equal measure reform of both the medical insurance system and the medical agency and pharmaceutical commodity circulation system , guiding all localities to step up implementation of medical insurance system reform programs , truly strengthening basic management , and stable expanding coverage .  
He told this reporter : Compiled by Mao Zedong and published in the past , " Selected Works of Mao Zedong " carries Mao 's most representative works written during the period of democratic revolution , and those works have since remained in circulation throughout the world as Mao 's classic works aimed at soundly integrating Marxism with China 's revolutionary realities , and as the most basic works guiding us in learning about and studying Mao Zedong Thought for a long time to come .  
" There is no lack of senior government officials and expert scholars who are familiar with East Asian affairs , international foreign affairs , and military security in the core members of the new Bush cabinet .  The basic tone and route of the China policy from Washington tends to establish a pragmatism .

Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
As the state-owned enterprise reform and structural readjustment move ahead due to intensified efforts and as our country 's old-age population grows at an accelerating pace , our country is bound to face a heavier task in guaranteeing basic livelihood for laid-off staff and workers or unemployed personnel and in guaranteeing proper social security for old people in urban areas as well .  Only by building or refining the " safety net " in terms of social security will we be able to maintain social stability ; promote social justice ;  
Sheng Huaren said that in view of some common problems in the process of establishing the modern enterprise system , the State Economic and Trade Commission , together with relevant departments , have formulated basic standards for establishing the modern enterprise system in medium and large enterprises and for strengthening their management , which have been approved and transmitted by the State Council to various localities for implementation .  
An Min pointed out : For a long time , Taiwan authorities have rejected direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait and adopted a series of obstructive and restrictive policies .  This is out of keeping with the basic demands of the people on both sides of the strait and the development of the situation , and has infringed upon the fundamental interests of the people on both shores , especially the Taiwan people .  This practice is increasingly unpopular .  
We must profoundly understand the extreme importance of increasing peasants ' incomes , press forward despite the difficulties ahead , and regard restructuring and increasing peasants ' incomes as the central assignments and basic objectives of our rural work at the new stage to be accomplished and attained with firm resolve .  
Zhu Bangzao said that complying with the purpose and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and norms governing international relations , especially the principles of respecting state sovereignty , not interfering in internal affairs , obtaining approval of the party concerned , neutrality , and not using force except for self-defense , is the fundamental guarantee to the smooth process and success of peacekeeping activities .  These principles remain to be the basic principles that should be strictly complied with in UN peacekeeping activities in future .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Authoritative figures point out that tariff concessions are a basic obligation on WTO members ; on the basis of mutual benefit and concession , these are aimed at lowering the general level of important and export tariffs , and in particular reducing high tariffs hampering imports , and also at setting the maximum tariffs for certain commodities , that is , constraining tariff rates and not levying tariffs in excess of those limits , so as to promote the free development of international trade .  
In order to preserve social stability and tranquillity and protect basic human rights and freedoms , the Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " organization and punished according to law a very small number of lawless and criminal elements ; and it has carried out thorough and meticulous work to educate and convert the great majority of those who were led astray , to enable them to return to a normal life .  
and banning prostitution , gambling , and narcotics .  We must unremittingly emphasize these basic work as measures to provide fundamental solutions in the " comprehensive management . "  We must reinforce the responsibility system and perfect the motivational and restrictive mechanisms to make " comprehensive management " a conscious action of grassroots cadres and masses .  
On the UN peace-keeping operations , Tang Jiaxuan emphasized : The UN reforms regarding the aspect of peace-keeping operations should be favorable for promoting the political resolutions of disputes and conflicts .  All those basic principles which have been proven effective through practice should not be neglected .  The UN Security Council should play a leading role in this regard .  
The participants held that the eight proposals put forward in President Jiang Zemin 's important speech on developing cross-strait relations and pushing the motherland 's peaceful reunification represent the application and development in the new situation of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's basic thinking on " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems , " and is a programmatic document and guiding idea for settling the Taiwan problem in the current stage .  
The Chinese Government , pursuant to the relevant law , bans and cracks down on the evil cult Falungong exactly for the purpose of protecting the citizens ' basic rights and freedom .  This is firmly supported and upheld by the people throughout the country and is also extensively understood by the international community .  
When talking about his government 's foreign policy in his administrative policy speech , Yoshiro Mori said : In the first half of the 21st century , Japan 's basic diplomatic strategy in the Asia-Pacific region will be based on its alliance with the United States and oriented to strengthening the friendly ties with the ROK , its neighbor , and maintaining a stable pattern in the Asia-Pacific region through building up mutually trusted and harmonious relations with China and Russia .  
The open letter emphasized : " The Chinese Government 's ban of the cultish organization of ' Falungong ' is a correct measure and the actual deed to safeguard the country 's political power and social stability , the sound mind and body of the people and the personal interests of the Chinese people .  It is to uphold the basic human rights of the Chinese people , which is purely an internal affair of China . "  
The province will stabilize its total acreage of basic farmland at 5.33 million hectares , and its total grain output , at 40 million tonnes .  By taking the market as the guide and by focusing on the need for optimizing products , the province will develop well-marketable products of a fine quality , products for special purposes , as well as new varieties of brand-name products , products with unique features , and less-common products ; meanwhile , it will also speed up the development of a new-type agriculture , environmental-friendly foodstuffs , and organic agricultural products .  
This important idea is a brilliant summary of our party 's basic strategy of leading the people to rule the country and bring peace and stability to it , an incisive summation of all experiences in ruling a country , which was gained by China and other countries in ancient times and today , and a new contribution to the Marxist theory of state , which is of momentous and far-reaching significance to promoting China 's reform , development , and stability in the new century and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
In light of the spirit of Zeng Qinghong 's speech and the currently existing problems , and for the guidance of work in the next stage , special stress should be laid on resolving the following problems to ensure that the study and education activities will be carried out in a solid and effective way : 1 ) Further stress the need to comprehensively understand and conscientiously put into practice the guiding ideology and basic principle for the study and education activities which were defined by the central authorities ;  
By 2010 , the scale of the information industry will again double .  The basic networks , research and production , and information service will be able to fully satisfy the needs of economic and social development and national defense building , and the overall standard will be one of the most advanced in the world , providing all information technology and equipment support and basic network support required for reform and opening up and modernization .  
a group of high technologies with genes , superconductors , ( nami ) , and microelectronic technology as the core will be rapidly drawn forward with the implementation of the NMD program , and those half-dead high-capacity lasers , particle clusters , and fixed direction weapons of the SDI program will again become key points for investment , and so the United States will achieve more innovations in the field of basic research , and is bound to occupy the commanding height in the world hi-tech field ;  
He held : In carrying out moral construction , we must persistently guide ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the important concept of the " three represents " and firmly grasp various important links influencing the formation of people 's thinking and moral ideas ; in addition , we must make and implement concrete guiding plans and integrate the requirements of the basic moral ideas into relevant laws , regulations , and specific policies and into various social controls .  
With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
That the Chinese Government has banned and cracked down on the " Falungong " cult organization according to law is precisely to safeguard and protect the basic human rights and freedoms of the Chinese citizens , and this has won the resolute support of all the people in China and the extensive support of the international community .  
This is also a typical expression of the dual standards for human rights of the United States . China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui ] to this move made by the United States . We demand that the United States abide by the basic norms of international relations , correct its wrongdoings and stop using so-called human rights issues to interfere in China 's internal affairs .  
Liu Jing said : The decision of the Chinese Government on banning " Falungong " was based on the demand of the broad masses and was aimed at safeguarding social stability and protecting the people 's basic human rights and freedoms .  The action has sufficient legal grounds and is completely in keeping with the legal procedures .  
The Chinese Government has always respected the international community 's universal principle on human rights and has actively worked to promote and protect the Chinese people 's human rights and basic freedoms , and tremendous results that have drawn worldwide attention have been achieved .  
In the new situation and in face of new challenges , we should have a firm grip of the party 's basic line of taking economic construction as a center , seize chances , quicken the tempo of development , exert ourselves to make the country prosperous , and immerse ourselves into hard work .  Only by so doing will we be able to narrow our gap with developed countries .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out the practice in opposing corruption in recent years has fully proven that the guiding ideology , basic principles , leadership system , and work mechanism for opposing corruption laid down since the 14th Party Congress by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core are completely correct , and we have formed a number of important understandings , accumulated some valuable experiences , and initially explored a road for effectively unfolding the anticorruption struggle suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
Zeng Jianhui , member of the NPC standing committee and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee , said : " China has always acknowledged and respected the universal principles of human rights of the international community , committed itself to the promotion and protection of the human rights and basic liberties of its citizens in accordance with its national conditions , and actively facilitated dialogue , exchange , and cooperation in the area of human rights in the international community . "  
During the past year , the NPC and its standing committee , in line with the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents , " earnestly performed the lofty responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and laws and made new progress in conducting legislative and supervisory work , and it carried out highly effective work and produced outstanding results in the endeavor to establish a rudimentary socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics and implement the basic plan of running the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Of these figures , the NPC and its standing committee have , since the ninth congress , formulated a total of nearly 60 laws and law-related decisions and most of the basic and principal laws of the seven branches of law that make up the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics have been enacted .  
Firstly , it requires party committees and leading cadres with party membership at all levels to further enhance their ideological understanding , fully recognize the superiority of this basic political system of our country , gain a deep understanding of the distinct features of China 's political party system , study and acquire knowledge of the glorious history of our party cooperating with democratic parties , and enhance their consciousness in cooperating with democratic parties .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
Deputy Caiwang Bandian , commissioner of the Administrative Office of the Nyingchi Prefecture , indicated : Ever since the beginning of reform and opening up , based on Tibet 's practical conditions , the central authorities have held three work conferences on Tibet ; helped Tibet get its idea on economic and social development into shape ; and have built up a number of basic facilities for the development of communication , energy , telecommunications , as well as agriculture and animal husbandry .  
Delegate Yao Qiong , Chairwoman of the Women 's Federation from the Daozhengelao minority autonomous county , proposed expansion of educational forces on behalf of national minorities in impoverished areas , increasing support for a new round of development in the area of poverty relief , strengthening cadre training at basic levels in rural areas , and promoting the overall development of rural economies .  
Although we have established a basic and preliminary framework for the socialist market economic structure , it has yet to be gradually improved .  In particular , the tasks for readjusting and improving the ownership structure and establishing and perfecting the market system will be rather arduous .  
The basic laws were formulated by the supreme legislative organ of the country in accordance with the Constitution . They are country-wide laws embodying the guiding principle and policy of " one country , two systems . "  The status of basic laws is higher than all the other local laws in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions .  
As Hong Kong and Macao had experienced long-time colonial rules , to comprehensively and accurately implement the basic laws , it should need a process .  It is necessary for us to make long-term efforts and , on the basis of loving the country and Hong Kong , jointly unite the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to strive for creating a kind of social environment which is favorable to implementing and fulfilling the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and the basic laws .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
At the same time , the proposal of these policy principles is very practicable .  For example , with respect to protecting and improving grain production capability , the ' outline ' stipulates strict execution of the basic agricultural land protection system , maintaining a dynamic equilibrium in the total amount of land under cultivation in the nation , and ensuring that by 2005 the total area of land under cultivation will not be less than 128 million hectares .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
They should see to a sound implementation of the relevant principles and policies adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council ; and ensure that both the minimum subsistence guarantee allowances for urban residents and the basic old-age pension for retirees can be issued at the scheduled time and in full amount without any delay , and ensure that the two kinds of pensions can increase in a rational way along with the country 's economic growth .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
This issue must be stressed here because this is the fundamental purpose of our economic development and also the basic requirement of the cardinal principles pursued by our party and government .  Under the current situation , this is also an issue worth special attention .  
Safeguarding the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is our most cardinal political principle and discipline and represents the basic interests of the state , the nation , and the broad masses of people .  All officers and men of the PLA must have a highly unified thinking , maintain a very firm attitude , and act on their own initiative .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
It is necessary to adhere to the basic economic system where public ownership is the main form of ownership and various sectors under diverse forms of ownership can develop together .  In accordance with the requirement of entering some areas while pulling out of others , we should let the state sector gravitate toward important industries and key fields that affect the lifeline of the national economy and further strengthen the control and dominance of the state sector in the national economy through the rational flow and optimized disposition of assets .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
In conformity with the requirements for WTO accession , " local content , " " export performance " and other stipulations that are inconsistent with WTO rules will be removed from this basic law for foreign investment which paved the way for the rush of foreign investors into the country .  The present amendment is the biggest move made by China to date in its review and revision of foreign-related laws and regulations in anticipation of WTO accession .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
" Being small but highly trained , economical , legitimate , and highly efficient should be the basic norm guiding our efforts in building a modern government , said member Yang Haikun , who added : It is true that we have seen everywhere phenomena like over-staffed institutions , redundant personnel , overlapped functions , or misplaced roles .  
The second is that the means of management are different .  The reemployment service centers of enterprises are in charge of the workers of the state-owned-enterprises who are removed from their work place , including the issuance of basic living expenses and paying of social insurance fees on behalf of the workers ; whereas socialized management is applied to the unemployed personnel .  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
Proceeding from this , we have decided on the basic line of " one center and two basic points , " and drawn up the basic economic , political , and cultural outline for building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and a whole series of guidelines and policies suited to our actual conditions ; as a result China has stood firm amid the constantly changing international situation , and achieved successes acknowledged by the whole world , advancing from victory to new victory .  
The CPPCC organizations at all levels should continue to carry out the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and the eight-point proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin , actively promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel visits , strive to unite all internal and external forces that can be united , resolutely oppose any attempt to split the motherland , and make contributions to accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland .  
Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .  
The basic old-age pension , basic medical care , and unemployment insurance for urban workers as well as the minimum subsistence guarantee system for urban residents will be further improved and perfected , and the registered unemployment rate in urban areas will be controlled below 5 percent .  
The current constitution in Japan was promulgated in November 1946 and implemented starting from May 1947 .  The fundamental idea of the constitution is to forfeit warfare , and support the idea of people having the right to make their own decisions , in addition to guaranteeing the basic human rights .  
Fifth , the structure of the personnel training will be adjusted .  While basic education is consolidated , high school education and tertiary education will be developed greatly .  The rate of tertiary education receivers in Henan Province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
This session held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , upheld the party 's basic line , comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and discussed the major strategic , macro , and policy issues facing China in entering a new stage of development in comprehensively building a comfortably well-off society and speeding up socialist modernization .  
The session holds that the summary of the work for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period contained in the Outline and Report is based on facts , while the targets , guiding principles , and main tasks set forth for the next five years ' work of economic and social development conform to the basic interests of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  They reflect the development of the times and the requirements of our modernization cause and can be realized through our efforts .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !

If CWHKT 's basic rental charge remains substantially below cost , which will still be slightly below cost after the increase , other local operators , whose costs are comparable to CWHKT 's , will find it difficult to offer competitive alternative services to the residential market without suffering a loss .  Ultimately , consumers will suffer because of the lack of a truly competitive market , " the spokesman said .

It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .

When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
In his History of Chinese Food Science , writer Hong Guang-zhu notes that the Chinese have long believed that flavors can be divided into five basic simple types : salty , sour , bitter , pungent and sweet .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
He has created his own " iron net " tsun technique ( a painting technique utilizing cracking to represent irregular surfaces ) , which remains true to ink painting 's basic principles of contrast between black and white ; however , the sheer strength of his contrasts , the starkness of his strokes and their motley cracking , all suggest the alienation and disorder of post-modern living .  
Furthermore , the Executive Yuan clearly stated that a satellite launching system would not be developed . The primary goal of the current Satellite Project is to develop satellite and related applied technologies . The secondary goal is to promote basic and applied space research .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
" When we look at things from the perspective of the fairy realm , that is to say on a large scale , the smaller scale of the mortal world becomes unimportant , " says Ke Ching-ming . He feels that imagining fairy realms is a way of observing the basic nature of the world from a unusual angle , in order to defuse problems . It provides a relativistic perspective , breaking down blind insistence on the absolute nature of values , and this enables humans to be more relaxed and natural in many ways .  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations . I was born and raised in Taiwan , and all my family and assets are here in Taiwan . My fate is linked to the fate of the vast majority of Taiwan 's people . I think this is the basic reason why the DPP is better positioned to deal with cross-strait relations than the KMT .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time . Meanwhile , unemployed workers are stuck in a trap and require basic assistance . The government has already implemented an advanced national unemployment policy that has turned from the passive stance of giving unemployment assistance to an active stance of providing employment services and professional training , government job creation , and helping workers change occupations .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
They improvised and created as they progressed , though they modestly refuse to claim any great brilliance about the whole thing : " It 's just the basic instinct for working with your hands that most people who grow up on the farm have . " But there is something special about the work of these hardy rural folk . In comparison with the trite , commonplace nature of bamboo facades that you can see all over the place , there is a touching rustic charm to the Grass Academy .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
Currently the weaving class has been held for three terms , and several dozen people have already mastered the basic techniques . The community has also sold looms . It 's just unfortunate that the women of the village , after finishing their regular housework , do n't have very much time leftover . Without any economic motivation , few continue with weaving after taking the course .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .  
Yet no matter what political slogans may have declared , no matter how popular nostalgic soap operas about the mainland were or how authentic the cuisine remained , none of these things could overcome one basic fact-the two sides were separated for 40 years , during which there was no contact , families were separated , no one traveled to see the mainland 's famous scenery , and all we could know about what was going on behind the PRC 's " bamboo curtain " were shocking photographs of famine years .  
At this , the TRA immediately ceased using the aluminum boxes , moving on to stainless steel ones . However , the costs involved with using stainless steel boxes were higher , meaning they could only offer them on the seat-bookable and deluxe expresses , while passengers on the basic and express trains were sold lunches in the old fiberboard boxes .  
For this reason , in addition to a basic classification based on materials and artists , artkey has classified 60,000 licensed art products under distinct themes , such as color , blood type , astrological sign , gender , season , and characters depicted .  
According to the fee schedules set by Taipei County 's Cable TV Fee Review Committee , the cost of accessing basic channels will be NT $ 150 per month . If other channels are selected , an additional charge will apply . However , the total may not exceed the current maximum for cable television fees of NT $ 600 . As for video services , users wishing to view other movies or videos will be charged extra for these .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
A few extra charcoal blocks are thrown on the fire to boil water and provide heat . Although the temperature in Taiwan 's plains can go as high as 30oC in late May , when night comes , it falls to 4-5oC on the north peak and there is often a strong cold wind . Sweaters , hats and thick socks are basic requirements all year round . " Not until November 1997 did a helicopter bring the first load of charcoal to the Yushan Weather Station , " says Hsieh .  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
From a cross-sectional perspective , reform has included changes in the core curriculum , a freeing up of the types of instructional materials used , and a variety of assessment methods , admissions , and approaches to teacher training . From a vertical perspective , reform has included the widespread establishment of new high schools and universities , the localization of normal and vocational high schools , policies regarding independent study in junior high schools , basic education testing , the promotion of English in elementary schools , and native-language instruction .  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing

In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
Research , understood as " careful search or inquiry , course of critical investigation " , " a systematic search for facts " , 3 / is and should continue to be a basic and generic activity at the same fundamental level as analysis and writing .  
That approach seeks to ensure that the basic needs of the poor , disadvantaged and vulnerable are addressed , that communities are empowered and that natural resources are managed and used in an optimal manner .

The plans focused on vulnerable social groups and poor geographical areas , addressing minimum basic needs with the aim of improving the quality of life and expanding the base of the decisionmaking process .  
The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights had requested States parties to establish basic benchmarks at the national level for achieving essential minimum levels of satisfaction of each individual economic , social and cultural right .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
To cite one major example , in and around Rwanda the circumstances challenged every aspect of supply operations remote location , poor roads in surrounding countries , meagre local stocks of basic supplies and unprecedented population movements .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
Keep peacemaking as proposed clearly in its basic tradition , the peaceful settlement of disputes , as foreseen in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations , in contrast to peace enforcement , which is perceived as a projection of provisional measures as defined in Chapter VII , Article 40 , of the Charter in respect to breaches of the peace and acts of aggression , but where both proposals are distinct permanent mechanisms to meet new challenges of the times .  
The basic coordinate of Slovakia 's foreign policy is its integration into the geopolitical and economic sphere with which we not only have numerous historical ties , but also and , I think , more importantly with which we share the same hierarchy of modern civilized values .  
Aware that its characteristics are atypical in our region , since its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic , oil-dependent model by an open culture based on work and self-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of other countries , our Government is proceeding to solve our nation 's problems , which , fortunately , are no match for our diverse and solid economic resources . 
At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
With the Second World War barely over , the international community of that time sought to establish a world organization which would save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by instituting a system of collective security based on the repudiation of the use of force save in the common interest , and on the basic principles of sovereign equality , freedom , justice and the rule of law .  
In practice , however , the basic and universal principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be ignored or violated by reason of the unequal and undemocratic set-up of international relations and through impositions upon , and interference in , the internal affairs of other countries , for different reasons and with a variety of justifications .  
Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable , high-quality services , the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development , and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society .  
Such developments have been accompanied by a natural yearning for the achievement of development in both its economic and social domains , while developments on the negative side have generated a wider cycle of racial , national and religious disputes in some regions of the world that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect for human rights and basic freedoms of the human individual , as well as regression of development both in the economic and social spheres .  
Today 's world dialectically combines within itself both dangers and threats fraught with instability and the risk of new global shocks , while nourishing the growth of an essentially new and different non-confrontational system of international relations .  Through ever more active multilateral efforts in confronting common challenges , we see more clearly the basic principles of such a system .  
At this crucial juncture in human history we are compelled by social and economic imperatives , characterized by growing poverty and marginalization of the powerless and the weak , to choose a course of action that will empower the citizens of the world to develop their full potential in order to enable them to secure their basic needs and improve their livelihood .  
The poverty alleviation programme aims to enable every Malawian to have access to basic necessities and to be able to develop and exploit his or her full potential to lead a productive , dignified and creative life through social , economic and political empowerment .  
While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The major international conferences organized by the United Nations have proven a useful means of studying basic questions relating to the goal of social emancipation and genuine sustainable development in all countries .

The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
The international community has learned from hard experience that initiatives implemented to supply the poor with basic needs have been less than successful when based solely on concerns for welfare , economic growth and income levels .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The preparatory group has identified three main issues that need to be resolved at the Oslo meeting : first , that we need to reach a common understanding of what basic social programmes to include in this context ; secondly , we need to define the modalities for implementing the 20 / 20 principle in operational terms ; and thirdly , we need to agree on ways of monitoring its implementation .  
Consensus in Beijing revolved around these basic principles : violence against women must stop ; girls must be valued equally with boys ; women must have equal access to education , health care and the levers of economic and political power ; family responsibilities should be shared ; and the human rights of women are an integral component of all human rights they are neither separable nor different from those of men .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region , the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner .  
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
We are deeply convinced that by making the NPT a Treaty of indefinite duration the States parties ensured its continued role as the major international legal instrument providing a basic guarantee for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .  
Poverty has various manifestations ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion ; it is also characterized by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil and socio-cultural life . 
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
To encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .

They underscore in our view a basic need for the United Nations to be responsive to the demands of a changing international political landscape whose form and content are yet to be fully assessed and fully determined so that the continuing legitimacy of the United Nations can be assured .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
In specific cases , the inclusion of special modules has been accompanied by the redesign of the basic questionnaire or at least parts of it , with the objective of continuing to adapt to changing conditions by incorporating improved techniques of research , and of perfecting the investigation of specific variables .

Aware that the voluntary repatriation of large numbers of Somali refugees in neighbouring countries and elsewhere , as well as the return of internally displaced persons to their original homes , will still require a planned and integrated international assistance programme designed to cover their basic needs , ensure adequate reception arrangements and facilitate their smooth integration into their respective communities ,  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .

Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights . 
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;

delegation considered that decision unjustified , since it linked the basic level of remuneration in the common system to non-representative remuneration levels in selected subsectors of the United States federal civil service .  
tasks of the transitional administration , as provided for in the basic agreement , include : to ensure the possibility for the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin ; to help to establish and train temporary police forces in order to build professionalism among the police and confidence among all ethnic communities ; to organize elections for all local government bodies ; and to maintain international monitors along the international border of the region in order to facilitate the free movement of persons across existing border crossings . 
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
would therefore be advisable to allocate increased resources to basic educational and vocational training , which were essential elements in promoting the economic development of the least developed countries .  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
to observe basic civil rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression , as had been the case in Nigeria recently with the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other prominent human rights activists , destroyed confidence in the judiciary , frightened people and impeded their empowerment .  
was not mere rhetorical emphasis to say that the developing countries - regardless of their good will and sense of responsibility - faced a difficult choice between paying their debts to the Organization or attending to their own basic needs .  
Moreover , as technology and social , economic and political change transform the world , managerial knowledge , skills and tools , which were once sufficient to maintain operational efficiency and performance of the public administration system , no longer satisfy the basic needs of government .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
The State was typical of the nineteenth century : a judge and gendarme liberal State assuming the essential duties of national defence , internal security , foreign relations , basic financial activity and justice .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
Amid all these problems , the Government of National Unity installed on 19 July 1994 was faced with the daunting challenge of rehabilitating and rebuilding a war-ravaged economy , reviving the provision of basic social services to a traumatized population , coping with the wreckage of genocide , stabilizing a fragile political alliance , and consolidating internal peace and security , as well as warding off looming military threats from exiled soldiers of the former regime .  
They also include improving public health , with emphasis on prevention and service for the most vulnerable groups especially children including planning , organizing and financing local health services ; improving basic public education , with emphasis on reducing illiteracy and on vocational training , with community participation , improved educational infrastructure , the promotion of culture and so on ; and the improvement of living conditions , physical planning and local infrastructure  
International peace and security , free trade , social development based on growth with equity , environmental protection , democracy and human rights are the basic components of the future work of our multilateral system . 
This has been done to achieve balance and stability in the economy as a whole and to activate the role of the private sector on the basis of a market economy and free competition , while taking into account the importance of improving basic essential social services , building a modern State and improving the standard of living of citizens .  
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .

Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
The establishment of the three inter-agency task forces on basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for economic and social development has proved to be instrumental in providing United Nations system-wide support and assistance , through Resident Coordinators , to national Governments in implementing the Summit goals .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .

The creation of basic social services schools , health centres and the provision of clean water is an important activity which the Government has carried out with the support of the international community in order to establish minimum conditions for the successful completion of the repatriation and resettlement of those Mozambicans who sought refuge in neighbouring countries during the armed conflict .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .

Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
Emphasizes that strategies for the eradication of poverty at the national and international levels and the provision of basic human needs should be formulated and implemented with the human being at their core , regardless of any political , economic , social or cultural considerations ;  
Recommends that States consider more operational ways of integrating a social exclusion concept into the design of global strategies for eradicating poverty , notably through human rights , democracy , good governance and administration , a stable legal framework , participation in decision-making , non-discrimination , tolerance and mutual respect for and valuing of diversity , universal access to basic social services and adequate social protection ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
The definition of basic human needs is broader in scope and extends to essential aspects of life , including employment , shelter and personal freedom .  Discussion focused on the provision of basic social services as an effective and cost-efficient way to reduce poverty and a fundamental contribution to the satisfaction of basic human needs .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
It must never be forgotten that behind the statistics , concepts and operational schemes were individuals caught in tragic situations whose only hope was a universal respect for the notion of human dignity , even if that was limited to the minimum for life , namely safety , food , shelter , water , medicine and basic education .  
Such problems include breaches of basic discipline such as the non-wearing of uniforms and lack of proper identification on vehicles ; the bearing of arms while off duty ; the disproportionate use of force in carrying out police duties ; lack of experience in the legitimate use of firearms ; inappropriate methods of crowd control ; and insufficient use of techniques for the peaceful settlement of disputes .  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;

An ever-increasing awareness that the ocean is a basic governing force for life on this planet , particularly for small island countries , and that better understanding of its physical and biological mechanisms , including their interaction with atmospheric processes , is essential to decision-making aiming at sustainable development ; 
We recognize that access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services is essential to a person 's physical , psychological , social and economic well-being and should be a fundamental part of our urgent actions for the more than 1-billion people without decent living conditions .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Provide equal access to basic education , while paying special attention to the poor and to youth living in rural areas , and addressing constraints created by distance , lack of educational facilities and social or economic barriers ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .

The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;

Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .

In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
However , administered or indicative maximum or minimum prices still exist in many countries of the region for selected agricultural exports or basic foodstuffs with the rationale of protecting the interests of the small farmers and the poor .

It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
On the basis of the cooperation agreement signed in 1976 between the two intergovernmental institutions , and strengthened in 1990 by an additional protocol creating a joint consultative commission , joint operational activities are regularly carried out by UNESCO and the Agency in the areas of basic education , education for adults , and after-school education the very foundations of an economic and social development that truly takes into account the human dimension of progress .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
It is beyond all doubt that a consistent implementation of all articles of the Dayton Agreement is crucial to the prospects for a normally functioning , democratic State capable of ensuring the basic social , legal , security and other conditions for everybody .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
Their tenuous situation has frequently been exacerbated as special programmes to promote their participation in the labour force and as basic services and social safety nets have been weakened or dismantled in order to meet strict budgetary requirements .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
The basic principles of the negotiations are recognized as dialogue , mutual and continuing respect between the parties , voluntary resettlement of individuals , non _ discrimination , observance of the letter and spirit of the peace agreements , protection of the environment , maximum social benefit , preferential and special treatment of vulnerable groups , and community participation .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
Likewise , all political , military or police authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina violating the Dayton / Paris Accords , international law and basic human rights must be held accountable and confronted by those responsible for implementation .  
The proclamation of a unilateral declaration of independence and the creation of the Bougainville Interim Government followed ; the situation has not yet returned to normal and , even though the naval blockade has been lifted , the population in some areas continues to be deprived of basic requirements and many allegations of serious violations of human rights continue to be reported . 
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
The basic mandate established by the Commission for the Sub _ Commission is ( a ) to undertake studies , particularly in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the protection of racial , national , religious and linguistic minorities , ( b ) to perform any other functions which may be entrusted to it by the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights .  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Centre for Human Rights should provide advisory services on the organization at the federal and State level of training courses for teachers in preschool , primary or basic and secondary educational establishments to make them aware of the importance of teaching the principles of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion and belief .  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Stresses the need for all countries to develop economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
Constant dialogue among the main social , economic and political actors will be necessary in order to move forward effectively on such basic issues as land , taxation , justice , public security , decentralization , local development and multiculturalism .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
It agreed that the term " national forest programme " is a generic term for a wide range of approaches to sustainable forest management within different countries , to be applied at national and subnational levels based on the basic principles outlined below .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
There are departmental directors in the nine regions and each of the main police stations is now headed by a commissaire ; salaries are paid more regularly ; many stations have received basic equipment ; radio links have been established between departmental headquarters and HNP headquarters in Port-au-Prince ; and cooperation with the judiciary has improved .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
The representative of Uruguay supported by the observer for Costa Rica , stressed the importance of preventive measures and international cooperation in eradicating basic problems such as socio _ economic ones , which made children more vulnerable to such practices . 
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
Mr . van Boven was requested to submit , without financial implications , in time for the Sub _ Commission 's consideration at its forty _ eighth session , a revised set of proposed basic principles and guidelines on remedies in the light of existing relevant international instruments , taking into account the new comments received from States and intergovernmental organizations and non _ governmental organizations , as well as the relevant sections of the report of the working group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
The section prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex , race , colour , nationality , religion , political opinion , social or family status or other similar circumstances .  Notwithstanding the fact that this principle was , before the Act entered into effect , considered to be one of the unwritten basic principles of administrative law , it was deemed necessary to enact an express provision to this effect .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
The working group of the Commission on Human Rights which was engaged in the elaboration of a draft optional protocol to the Convention intended to establish a preventive system of visits to places of detention was endeavouring to reconcile various national positions while maintaining intact the basic principles of regular and ad hoc visits to detention centres , participation of experts in missions and the integrity of the text to be adopted .  
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .  
The attempt to change the meaning of food security from being a basic human right to mere participation in the global markets , which by definition excluded all those lacking adequate purchasing power , was contrary to that principle .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
Development called for the private sector to act as the engine of sustained economic growth , in partnership with the public sector , which played a crucial role in basic infrastructure and services and in establishing and maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , protecting human rights and the environment and creating a conducive legal environment for private investment and entrepreneurship .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
These UNESCO Chairs play an active role in upgrading the knowledge of basic values of human rights , democracy and peace at the university level and at the same time serve as focal points for promoting education for peace , tolerance and international understanding at all educational levels .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Calls upon all countries to develop economic policies that promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investment , and to seek innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for social programmes , while ensuring their effective utilization , and in the budgetary process , to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public resources , and to give priority to providing and improving basic social services ;  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political , economic and social realities of each of them , in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation , Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
The sponsor stated that the purpose of the draft declaration was to develop a comprehensive United Nations document in the format of a declaration containing a set of model basic principles , agreed by all Member States , to guide peacekeeping and other relevant activities of the Organization .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Our commitment to the setting up of such a court stems from the fact that this court would be a landmark development in the creation of a balanced and effective system aimed at ensuring that international crimes , especially mass violations of basic fundamental human rights , do not remain unpunished .  
The outcome of our recently held parliamentary elections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our foreign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by the overwhelming majority of the Polish people . 
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Mr . Wilmot ( Ghana ) : The World Summit for Social Development , held in Copenhagen in August 1995 , brought into sharp focus the profound nature of underdevelopment in the world and created a sense of urgency for mobilizing energies and resources at the national and international levels to implement strategies to eradicate poverty , promote full employment and foster social integration as a basic policy priority .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
The fact that we have managed to defend the most important social benefits in decades , in such difficult and unusual conditions , strengthens the thesis that in a framework of social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth , certain basic goals of social development can be reached in situations where economic growth is limited , even negative .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) : A few days ago in the Third Committee , we had the privilege of a highly stimulating and thought-provoking introduction by Mr . Nitin Desai , Under-Secretary-General for the newly constituted Department of Economic and Social Affairs , on the basic issues bearing on economic and social development facing the international community at the present juncture .  
While India is forging ahead with its policy of economic reform and liberalization , public policy is being re-oriented towards supporting agricultural growth , building up infrastructure and ensuring universal access to basic minimum services like health , education , drinking water , food and nutrition , shelter and so on .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .  
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
Our efforts are focused on trying to establish a common market , within a gradual and continuous process in which the basic stages still need to be rounded off , improved and studied in depth .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
The denial of basic human rights , the confiscation of one 's rightful property and ancestral home , the denial of free movement , the obstruction of necessary economic activity , the importation of thousands of foreigners to be settled in confiscated land in occupied territory , the systematic and deliberate splitting of the West Bank through streams of bypass highways and indiscriminately placed settlements all these , in our view , amount to a clear record of violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli authorities .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The Centre for Family Friendly Cities of the University of Akron , Ohio , United States of America , created an interactive communications network on the World Wide Web designed to store , search and retrieve information on , inter alia , family relationships , sexuality and reproduction , special problems and risk factors , family counselling and education , cultural social and urban issues , basic needs , leisure and entertainment , consumption and sustainable development and work .  
As recently as 1995 , all the CIS countries shared one basic feature : precipitous and sweeping economic decline ( the two notable exceptions in 1995 were Armenia and Georgia , where GDP had grown a little after the nearly catastrophic collapse of previous years ) .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .  
People are being denied their basic rights ; their houses , shops , mosques , churches and synagogues are burned to the ground ; they are beaten up , maimed and even killed ; and all this in the name of an evil we call racism , which does not leave its victims alone even after they die : the number of cemeteries that are being desecrated is growing at a worrisome pace .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
Issues deserving future analysis are ( a ) whether there is a need to accord special treatment to SMEs in both MEAs and in the multilateral trading system ( e.g . the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures ) in the course of raising environmental standards ; ( b ) whether special trading opportunities could assist SMEs in moving to higher environmental standards ; and ( c ) what should be the basic features in the design of a package of measures for SMEs .  
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
Despite abject poverty in the slums surrounding the cities , living conditions are still considered preferable to those in rural areas , particularly with regard to access to water and the availability of basic services , such as health and education , as well as access to markets , which provides opportunities in the private sector .  
Given the gravity of the concerns highlighted , the mandate remains a most sensitive and difficult one since it relates to a State Member of the United Nations where governmental authority is absent and a State administration non _ existent , with the adverse impact this implies on the observance and protection of basic human rights and freedoms .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Governments and all other actors should make special efforts to achieve the benchmarks set in the Platform for Action of universal access to basic education and completion of primary education by at least 80 per cent of primary school-age children by the year 2000 ; close the gender gap in primary - and secondary-school education by the year 2005 ; provide universal primary education in all countries before the year 2015 ; and consider providing multilateral and bilateral assistance .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
In addition to the costed population package , the Programme of Action also calls for socio-economic development programmes designed to strengthen the primary health-care delivery system and child survival programmes , provide universal basic education , improve the status and empowerment of women , generate employment , address environmental concerns , provide social services and address poverty eradication through sustained economic growth .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Terrorism had been clearly and definitively rejected by the international community because it violated the most basic of human rights , the right to life ; because it mutilated , tortured and violated human minds and bodies ; and because , with its underlying morbid and fascist philosophy , it aimed to paralyse social , political and cultural life and to obstruct the normal exercise of rights and freedoms .  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
A sound peace agreement which is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human , political and economic rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
You have no doubt noted that , even after the submission of your report to the Security Council of 2 June 1997 ( S / 1997 / 419 ) , two of the members of the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , namely the United States and the United Kingdom , are continuing to raise numerous difficulties and obstacles to the proper implementation of the provisions of the memorandum of understanding by impeding the approval of contract applications for the purchase of food , medicines and other basic humanitarian requirements .  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
As a follow-up to commitment 3 made at the Social Summit to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , 5 the Secretariat organized a one-day seminar on world employment strategy to discuss the Report on World Employment 1996 / 97 issued by the International Labour Office , and to reflect on policies that may contribute to improving employment projects at the national and international level .  
The States members of the League of Arab States fully support the cause of transparency in armaments as a means for enhancing international peace and security and believe that , in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain basic principles : it must be balanced , comprehensive and non-discriminatory , and it must enhance the national , regional and international security of all States in conformity with international law . 
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .  
It is quite obvious from the letter itself that the story fabricated by the Eritrean regime , in collaboration with the Sudanese terrorist elements , the so-called National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) , harboured and sheltered by Eritrea , is a tasteless drama , directed by naive unprofessional persons , who lack the basic principles of logic .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
The commitment made at Copenhagen to eradicate poverty in the world also called for action at the international level to ensure that policies and programmes will advance the attainment of agreed developmental goals that are aimed at meeting basic needs for all and eradicating absolute poverty ; the participation of the people concerned is an integral part in this endeavour .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation had held its first ministerial meeting in Mauritius in March 1997 and adopted its charter , the basic principles of which were respect for sovereign equality , territorial integrity and political independence , non-interference in internal affairs , peaceful coexistence and mutual advantage .  
On the contrary , the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela has expressed in numerous statements its categorical repudiation of unilateral coercive acts that adversely affect the economies of developing countries , on the ground that such acts contravene the basic principles of coexistence and international economic cooperation and the world consensus regarding the need for a non-discriminatory and open trading system .  
The expert group confirmed that the basic principles of international law to be applied in assessing the legality of coercive economic measures are those of non-intervention and non-discrimination , based on such norms as the sovereignty and sovereign equality of States and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means .  
Human resources development will be achieved by organization of training courses , at basic and advanced levels , in methods for the identification and analysis of controlled drugs in seized material , pharmaceutical preparations , body fluids and precursors ; development and distribution of training syllabuses , teaching aids and scientific literature to regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; and organization of regional workshops of heads of national drug-testing laboratories .  
A strengthened rule of law is essential to safeguarding basic freedoms , protecting ethnic and religious minorities , promoting Government accountability and providing social stability and the legal framework necessary for economic development .  
As the first comprehensive international proclamation of the basic rights of the individual , it established a common understanding of human rights for mankind .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
He said that an understanding of the basic underlying technology of the Internet was essential , as the technological limitations and the possibilities of the Internet shaped potential public policy options .  
At a more basic level , the question was raised as to whether the categories of acts listed in chapter III of the outline possessed sufficient elements in common to be treated alike or to be subjected to the same legal regime .  
The right to development , which was a basic right , was essential for promoting and protecting economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , since poverty was a real obstacle to the effective enjoyment of those rights . 
The recession had given rise to falling prices of raw materials and basic commodities , increased protectionism by the industrialized countries , the absence of a genuinely free transfer of technology , and a staggering rise in the external debt .  
While human rights education was not an obligatory part of the national curriculum , the concept of the equal worth of human beings was among the basic values taught at the primary school level .  
In developing a national legislation , it has been found convenient to first construct an umbrella or a framework environmental law which lays down the basic legal principles without attempting to codify all relevant statutory provisions .  
The other half include mainly fuels , minerals , wood , other basic commodities and intermediate inputs required by industry , as well as certain tropical and fishery products of substantial export interest to a wide range of developing countries .  
Basic space science is a key to the prosperity of a nation and it is almost impossible to expect a country to have significant economic and social development without a sound educational and research base in the field of basic space science .  
Satellite communications systems , featured by large footprints ( coverage ) , ranging in size from a country to a continent , avoid the need for terrestrial infrastructure and shorten the time for establishing basic and advanced communications in rural areas .  
The basic objective of the national population programme for the period 1995-2000 was to raise living standards and the quality of life of all Mexicans , and to bring demographic trends into line with the country 's potential for economic development .  
That required an approach to development which valued responsible economic management , respected human rights , affirmed gender equity , assured access to productive assets and met basic human needs .  
The basic idea was to integrate the most disadvantaged population groups into the national economy and to guarantee them equal opportunity for access to basic services , decent housing , productive employment and an adequate standard of living .  
The Commission sharpened its focus on the intolerable living conditions of large sectors of humanity and the serious and grave violations of basic economic , social and cultural human rights those conditions entail .  
He remarked that urgent measures should be taken to erase the external debts of the developing countries , many of which were so crippled by debt servicing that they were unable to provide basic economic and social services .  
Regrettably , he was bound to report that the situation of human rights in Iraq had not improved during the previous year , and that the Iraqi Government continued to commit massive and systematic violations of the basic rights of the population .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
They stressed that the basic principles of a democratic State governed by the rule of law included multi-partyism , freedom of the press , an independent judiciary and free , fair and transparent elections .  
They support exchanges and cooperation , including joint projects , in basic and applied scientific research as well as in areas of research and development with potential for the development of modern society and sustainable economic growth in the future .  
The Act contains provisions common to all recent national legislative acts and addresses the basic concepts of literary and financial copyright , holders of copyright , the free use of protected works , period of copyright and means of protecting copyright .  
It also recommended adopting the 20 / 20 concept of mutual commitment for basic social programmes , providing youth with a secure and healthy future , and supporting efforts for capacity-building for human development .  
The basic curriculum , pursuant to which the subject curriculum for pre-university education is under elaboration , is based on fundamental principles regarding general human , social and cultural values .  
Social development is impossible when basic essential social services are denied to the civilian population and where vulnerable members of the community are indiscriminately exposed to bombing , summary execution , rape and the threat of landmines .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
This Alliance represents a regional and national strategy whose basic principle is to bring about integral changes in Central American economic , social , cultural and environmental development , with every aspect geared towards respecting all forms of life , improving the quality of life , preserving and respecting the diversity of the planet and our region and respecting human rights and multiculturalism in our region .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .

Since the informal economy which harbours a significant proportion of irregular migrants operates largely at the periphery or outside the national protection system , States should be encouraged to extend the basic human rights standards to this sector and to enforce them , and to assist enterprises to improve their economic capacity , thereby enabling them to meet these standards .  
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

One of our priorities is to provide a better standard of living for citizens , embodied in the context of the population strategy included in the comprehensive national strategy which summarized the population problem in the Sudan into three basic categories : the existing incompatibility of economic growth with that of population growth , declining population characteristics , and the imbalance of population distribution .  
The aforementioned categories have been linked to the basic objectives of the national strategy for promoting compatibility between economic development and population growth and for improving the other categories , in order to create a better standard of living and to reduce poverty .  
India considers that the integration of environmental and developmental concerns is essential for the fulfilment of basic needs and ensuring improved living standards for all , better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer and more prosperous future .

In addition to providing basic services for our society and improving economic performance , the challenges of the future will make it necessary to build bridges across generations and create a more understanding and progressive cultural milieu in which young and old together embrace the new values of our evolving societies while respecting the traditions that we have inherited from our forefathers . 
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
The Office for Civil Affairs , which will be responsible for overseeing and , where necessary , conducting a number of civil affairs functions , such as civil service and economic and budgetary affairs , as well as supporting the restoration and provision , in the short run , of basic public services , such as public health , education , utilities , transport and telecommunications .

Developing countries need to be encouraged to utilize space in support of their national developmental activities and to address the basic requirements of their people : education , pollution monitoring , health , telecommunications , environmental management , weather and climate applications , utilization of natural resources , food security , urban and rural infrastructure , land-use management and many other local-level resource problems ;  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
These included the reviews of technical assistance activities submitted to the annual meetings of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Competition Law and Policy ; analytical studies dealing with economic aspects of restrictive business practices ; practical information papers outlining the basic features of restrictive business practices ; commentaries on a possible model law on restrictive business practices ; and the reports of regional seminars organized by UNCTAD .  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .

The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
The theme would include human resource development through basic science education , research and development , as well as their interdisciplinary aspects ; the transfer , commercialization and diffusion of technology ; increasing public awareness and participation in science policy-making ; and bio-ethics , bio-safety , bio-diversity , and the legal and regulatory matters affecting these issues to ensure equitable treatment . 
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .

With a view to strengthening the capacity of the existing health facilities to provide quality maternal health-care services , 58 female health personnel have been trained in essential obstetric care and basic obstetric care equipment and supplies were provided to health facilities in the region . 
The international community has repeatedly condemned the harmful impact of such measures on trade relations among States and on the full realization and enjoyment of human rights , in particular the right to enjoy a standard of living adequate for health and well-being , including food , health care , housing and basic social services , and the right to development .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .

A total of $ 9.7-million has been received ( from Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) ; however , $ 38-million is still required to raise to a basic minimum standard the functioning and efficiency of the local police forces .  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .

Given the intrinsic link between human rights and development , the Hearing emphasized the need to promote respect for basic human rights , and noted that the right to development is a fundamental right that must be recognized , acknowledged , upheld and seen as an integral component of human rights .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , if permitted by the basic principles of domestic legal systems , States Parties shall take appropriate measures , when necessary , to permit their competent authorities to use special investigative techniques such as controlled delivery and electronic surveillance within their own territories .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,

The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .

The Minister explained , however , that , while the legislation in force in Cameroon since what was generally known as the Afreedoms session @ of the National Assembly ( 1990 ) guaranteed the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in various international and regional instruments , the task of creating a genuine human rights culture , not only among the forces of law and order but also among the public , still lay ahead . 
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
It was high time that the basic rights recognized for national civil services and enshrined in ILO Conventions No . 98 and No . 154 should be recognized , with appropriate adjustments , for the international civil service , since it was unthinkable that ILO and the international financial institutions should fail to apply internally the basic rules they would like to see implemented internationally .

However , in order to protect workers from employers who might attempt to impose harsh wage conditions or who might fail to pay workers a wage sufficient to meet their basic needs , the State has felt obliged to intervene in order to improve the living standards of workers and , consequently , contractual freedom is no longer absolute in the field of employment since the State has begun to intervene in order to protect workers , particularly in regard to wages .  
Due regard must also be paid to the need for consistency in classification , nomenclature , terminology and definitions and the committee 's minimum wage proposals must be based on those to which an average skilled and competent worker is entitled , without gender-based discrimination , in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and the need to ensure that the wage is sufficient to meet the worker 's basic needs .

The Council reviewed the economic developments under way in the international arena and reached two basic conclusions : that globalization is inexorably making its presence felt in the world and leaving its stamp on this historical era ; and that this fact makes it imperative to establish strong economic entities that are able to cope with it and the developments it brings with it without falling prey to economic convulsions that are prejudicial to the prosperity of citizens .  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,

As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .

The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
Equally important , they must promote and incorporate policies for universal access to basic and primary education , improved literacy , increased life expectancy , reduced infant and maternal mortality rates and the achievement of levels of health that lead to socially and economically productive lives .  
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
Nonetheless , the urgent appeal made by the Social Summit for emergency measures to address the very serious problems of poverty , unemployment , illiteracy and lack of basic medical care , among others which were , and continue to be , responsible for the increasing social marginalization in third-world societies was received with resolute hope . 
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .

Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .

In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .  
Reforms in this area have supported the Triennial Reconstruction Plan , which focuses on revitalizing the national economy , rehabilitating basic infrastructures , controlling inflation , fighting corruption and unemployment and protecting property and personal safety .

Whether they have fled their homes or remained in an unstable area , whether they have crossed an international border to relative safety or sought refuge nearby , their lives or their basic human needs may be at risk .  
Striving to meet basic needs but unable to increase their productivity , poor rural households in most lowincome countries have been forced to expand onto marginal lands and / or mine their existing land base through unsustainable landmanagement practices .  
The objective is to achieve adequate shelter and access to basic services for all , especially the deprived urban and rural poor , through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter and services .  
On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
UNDP defines poverty as human poverty , deprivation in the most basic choices people have such as to live a long and healthy life , to be educated , to have the means to a decent standard of living and to be able to be a part of the life of a community . 
We consider universal access to basic education and a substantial improvement in its quality to be the pillars of our commitment to social development and a fundamental basis for productive human development and democracy .  
Investment in education , including basic and digital literacy , remains the fundamental way of developing human capacity and should be at the heart of any national , regional and international information technology strategy .  
At such times , it might not be known whether organized crime was involved or it might be impossible to meet any basic standard of proof as a prerequisite to obtaining assistance under the Protocol .  
To maximize the effectiveness of budgetary funds allotted for preventive and curative service through introducing basic public and clinic treatment based on primary health care ;

The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
Activities include improving the quality of education for all children so that learning environments are effective , healthy , protective and gendersensitive , and each child attains a desired level of achievement upon completion of the basic education cycle .  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
In addition to problems stemming from a process of structural and economic reforms in order to establish a basic framework for a market economy , the country was hit by the financial crisis in 1998 in the Russian Federation , a major trading partner , a serious drought and rising prices for imported energy , on which the country is heavily dependent .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
Because countries have different social systems , ideologies , value systems and religious beliefs , it is necessary in international relations to strictly abide by the basic principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-aggression , non-interference in the internal affairs of other States , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
In summing up , the basic issue before us today is the following choice between two alternatives : either we seize this opportunity to radically simplify and promote the flow of everyday civilian goods into Iraq , thereby establishing beyond any doubt that the international community is giving paramount importance to humanitarian concerns , while keeping sensitive goods under control ; or we preserve the status quo .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .

In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education .

The basic orientation of the programme involves three main types of activities : ( a ) the mobilization and coordination of international support ; ( b ) enhanced monitoring and assessment of activities ; and ( c ) advocacy and promotion of global awareness with respect to Africas critical economic and social situation .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .

Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .

ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .

It had endorsed the two major international human rights covenants , was currently drafting a basic law on the guarantee of human rights and had shared with many countries the benefits of its outstanding achievements in economic development , agriculture , global trade and information and communications technology .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has done important and indispensable work in recent years to build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist acts , wherever and by whomever they are committed , are criminal and unjustifiable by any political , religious or philosophical considerations .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established .
