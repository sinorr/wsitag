UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
We have been all the while upholding the rule of law , keeping an efficient and administration-oriented government as well as honest and competent civil servants .  We have continuously improved qualifications of our working population , promoted free enterprise and free trade , ensured the free flow of information , maintained a stable budget system and healthy financial mechanism , pursued a prudent public financial policy and implemented a simple and clear low rate of taxation .  
He said that , we should diligently summarize and promote these good experiences , establish a system to encourage competition and diligence and honesty in managing state affairs , and a contingent of national civil servants that regard the serving of the people as their goal , that maintain close links with the masses , that are capable and highly efficient , that are of honest and devoted to their duties , so as to strengthen the vigor and vitality of the government agencies .  
The system of holding open trials for civil cases and administrative counterappeals should be carried out and improved .  We should strengthen the supervision and restrictions over such prosecution procedures as reporting crimes , conducting preliminary investigations , placing cases on file , adopting compulsory measures , dropping cases , disapproving arrests , not instituting legal procedures , and appealing for reexamination .  
Forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high-speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries . 
Over the last year , the form and scope of making procuratorial work open have continued to broaden - - we have established a procuratorial work report system and a rights and obligations briefing system ; we have experimented on a system to open examination of civil and administrative counterappeal cases , nonprosecution cases , and criminal petition cases ; and procuratorial work has been made more transparent , which has been well received by the public .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
Governments at all levels should adjust the expenditure structure , guarantee the issuance of basic livelihood allowances for laid-off workers , pensions for retired personnel , minimum livelihood guarantee allowances for urban residents , and salaries for civil servants in full amounts and on time .  The building of the social security system should be further improved .  Resolute actions should be taken to crack down on activities of producing or selling counterfeit and inferior products , thus protecting the interests of consumers .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
some people , seeing others getting rich ahead of them , become mentally unbalanced , are no longer content with the salaried way of life of civil servants , stay aloof from the workers and peasants , draw close to " big money , " and gradually change from small fishing to big corruption .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
After the Criminal Procedural Law was amended in 1996 , administrative detention was rescinded .  As this prevents prolonged detention in some cases , the improper adoption of coercive measures has been reduced , and people 's civil rights have been better protected .  At the same time , this does not produce any negative impact on the effectiveness of cracking down on crimes . "  
What is even more exasperating is , no one knows how does this Saddam possess such a remarkable supernatural power , but he somehow has managed to make civil aircraft from some countries , including US allies , to fly one after another into Baghdad in spite of the ban .  The " no flight zones " masterminded by the United States with painstaking efforts have thus been reduced to fragments .  The Americans have suffered a severe case of losing face .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Developing socialist democracy must be combined with making socialist democracy a systematic and legalized affair ; we must follow the law , strictly enforce the law , pursue violations of law , and also integrate ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , so as to ensure that all work in the state proceeds in smooth fashion , ensure good economic and social order , and ensure the civil rights and legitimate interests of the masses .  
This consensus confirms : The " International Civil Aviation Convention , " signed in Chicago in 1994 , is definitely not applied to military aircraft and national aircraft , but respecting and observing the related rules and the basic demands of the Convention is conducive to ensuring the safety of both sides ' military and civil aircraft flying over the international airspace .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
China assigns importance to the development of friendly ties with Lebanon and is happy to see Lebanon ending its civil war , achieving national conciliation , recovering the occupied territories in Southern Lebanon , and restoring political stability .  He wished that Lebanon would be able to make still greater achievements in economic recovery and reconstruction .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
An official in Shenzhen who is familiar with the conditions of the reform of the civil service system said that if the experiments of openly recruiting intermediate-level officials from society were proved successful , then before 2010 such practice may be extended to the posts at the level of vice minister and vice provincial governor .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
Zhang Fusen stressed that in performing the work of popularizing laws in the next five years , emphasis will be laid on the key points and efforts will be made to attain still more remarkable progress in the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , the training of civil servants , and the education on legal system among youngsters and students , so as to ensure that the popularization of laws will make a good start at a still higher standard in the new century .  
Of the big three links , only the issue of direct air links has remained unsettled .  If the government is anxious to see the big three links coming into force , the Mainland Affairs Council should handle this issue in accordance with the Hong Kong mode , namely , authorizing an unofficial representative from the civil aviation sector to sign an agreement with the mainland side .  
In accordance with the overall plans for stopping the source and blocking the flow of drugs , public security and anti-narcotics departments as well as border defense , customs control , railroad , communications , civil aviation and other related departments in Yunnan , Guangxi and Guizhou in China 's southwestern region have further improved their investigation networks as well as their comprehensive multi-force joint operations , thus effectively cutting off the frantic infiltration of drugs into our country .  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
In accordance with their international obligations and national laws and regulations , the two parties will take effective steps to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of legal and human entities of one party in the territory of the other party , and will provide each other with the necessary assistance in civil and criminal adjudication .  
It has been learned that in accordance with the overall plan of cutting off the supply and checking the spread of drugs , public security organs in charge of narcotics control as well as departments in charge of border defense , Customs , railways , communications , and civil aviation in all localities have further perfected their anti-drug networks , launched an all-positioned combined campaign against drug-related crimes participated in by different services under the Police Force , and has effectively checked a frenzied infiltration of drugs into China from outside the country .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
The average annual indirect income should come to 150 to 200 billion yuan if calculated according to a ratio of one-to-two to three ( a conservative estimate ) between direct incomes from civil aviation and the indirect incomes ( tourist , insurance , and postal earnings for instance ) .  
In this connection , I suggest removing provincial civil aviation administrative bodies and putting into practice a model of vertical administration of the regions by the state , establishing a unified system of air regulation in civil aviation , and strengthening investment in air control systems and insofar as possible adopting the world 's most advanced air control techniques and equipment .  
as published ] " and that he himself was " a citizen of a fallen state " shortly after escaping to Taiwan . Now the Taiwan authorities ' so-called " Republic of China " is in fact nothing but a historical issue left from the civil war between the Kuomintang [ KMT ] and CPC . It is illegitimate according to either domestic or international law and it fundamentally has no right to represent China .  
The draft law specifically stipulates that it is the exclusive authority of the NPC and its standing committee to legislate the ten categories of laws that have a bearing on the state 's basic political system , economic system and legal system including civil and criminal laws , an authority that covers such fields as the deprival of civil and political rights , the punishment in terms of restricting the right to personal freedom , and litigation and arbitration systems .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
Policy steps such as issuing treasury bonds , sharply lowering interest rates , taxing interest , and raising civil service salaries strengthened individual buying power , to play a key role in pulling sustained economic growth and promoting higher economic efficiency on one hand , while promoting a gradual consumer price rebound on the other .

Procuratorates , people 's courts , civil affairs departments , finance departments , women 's federations , propaganda departments , departments in charge of comprehensive management of public order , and other departments should perform their respective duties and functions , make concerted efforts to tackle problems in this regard , and coordinate closely with one another in continuously deepening the special struggle to " crack down on abduction and trafficking in women and children . " 
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
The circular also particularly stressed that labor protection agencies , civil affair departments , and social security insurance organs at all levels should conscientiously change their work style , understand in a timely fashion the opinions and demands expressed by laid-off workers , retirees , and financially-troubled entities .  They should resolve in a timely fashion the difficulties and problems with which the people are most dissatisfied .  In addition , they should report the situation to relevant departments of a higher level .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
When headed by Vice Mayor Wang , the city government housing bureau was found to have violated the rules and developed unwanted houses in Meilin First Village and many other projects , thus sparking protests from several hundred home buyers , who were civil servants .  It was understood that the civil servants were unhappy with the housing bureau 's illicit transfer of some projects to Wang Ju 's son .  
After the all-out civil war broke out , the party again made in a timely fashion a set of correct policy decisions in light of the major changes taking place in the situation at home and abroad , which helped achieve victory in the war of liberation and found New China .  
The SAR Government has attached great importance to studying and resolving problems left over from British rule such as bubble economy , overly narrow industrial structure base , excessive expenditure , cramming-style education , and the practice of civil servants eating from the same big pot , and has set reform targets to meet the challenge of the new economic era .  
( 11 ) The interested parties are social public welfare institutions and social welfare enterprises in the charge of civil administrative departments such as welfare institutes , orphanages , homes for the elderly , hospitals for disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and servicemen , mental hospitals , and SOS [ as published , acronym given in English ] children villages .  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
All of the original civil , economic ( intellectual property ) , and communications divisions applied the civil procedure law when trying cases , and all the cases they tried were related to the legal relations between equal and civil entities .  However , through the current restructuring , all of the economic ( intellectual property ) cases and communications and transportation cases have been incorporated to the major category of civil justice .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .  As a major readjustment of the civil justice , this will exert a positive and far-reaching influence on the practice and theoretical study of China 's justice .  
The fourth civil division has been set up to counter the situation that maritime cases and the commercial cases involving foreigners as well as Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots have increased by a large number along with the constant expansion of opening-up .  With this division , the trial work will take up the challenge from economic globalization .  
Supreme People 's Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan said today at a briefing on reform of the court structure that in order to meet the new demands and challenges on judicial work resulting from economic globalization and China 's WTO accession , the Supreme People 's Court will carry out a major reform of the court establishment and set up the no . 4 civil cases court specifically to deal with maritime affairs and law and disputes involving foreign and Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan businessmen .  
Charged with the onerous and complex tasks of fixing posts for personnel and locating posts for some personnel , local organizational and personnel departments have formulated policies to advance reform in the spirit of being responsible for every civil servant , organizing the competitive assignment of posts and two-way choosing .  
Appointment to posts by competition has now developed from being a transitional means in the early stage of instituting the civil servant system into a systematized and standardized method of selecting and employing people by which civil servants are promoted , posts rotate , and people are selected for popular posts ; and the scope of appointment to posts by competition has expanded from middle-grade leading cadres to non-leadership posts and departmental leadership posts .  
Amid the series of eye-catching reforms of the cadre and personnel system , appointment to posts by competition has become a glittering point , which has opened up people 's vision regarding selection and employment , effectively prevented unhealthy trends in employing people , and reduced to the minimum the phenomenon of " selecting the wrong person " in cadre selection ; it has played a positive role in building a high-quality civil service force and allowing the emergence of more outstanding talent .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
It is closed that there is great potential for cooperation of mutual benefit between China and Russia . For example , cooperation in the fields of petroleum , natural gas , nuclear energy , machine building , civil aviation , telecommunications and aviation [ sic ] will be discussed by the Chinese and Russian prime ministers during their regular meeting in Beijing this October .  
From the automobile industry to the civil aviation industry , and to sales of color televisions , enterprises , facing fierce market competition , are flaunting the banner of " developing national industries and standardizing market competition . "  They have conducted various summits and formed price alliances to formulate minimum prices or maintain prices .  The trend of the practice of industrial monopolies is growing bigger and stronger .  
3 .  Railway , civil aviation , and transportation departments and enterprises should take resolute steps to stop the operation of any transportation vehicles that have mechanical problems .  In addition , the phenomena of violating safety regulations , such as over-loading , over-speeding , and violation of traffic regulations , should be resolutely stopped .  Passengers who carry with them flammable , explosive , poisonous , and dangerous articles should be strictly inspected .  They should be prohibited from taking transportation vehicles so as to ensure transportation safety .  
and attained attention-attracting accomplishments as follows : China has strategically changed the guiding concepts governing civil air defense .  China has simultaneously enhanced both civil air defense facilities and urban construction ; strengthened the security of key targets ;  
We should seize opportunities , and accelerate the pace of upgrading our civil air defense projects .  Within a relatively short time , we should strive to establish and develop an organizational and command system that is unified and highly efficient , a protective engineering system that is rationally structured , a telecommunications and alarm system that is sharp and reliable , a contingent of specialized personnel who are highly competent , an effective system for dispersing the population , and a system for facilitating modern scientific research and cultivating talents .  
The Russian experts believed that China 's civil aviation strength and scientific and technological strength for national defense , including China 's ship management equipment , electronic products , and so on , are already among the most advanced in the world .  After visiting some academies of sciences and aircraft production plants in China , the Russian experts concluded that China has already attained the standard required for cooperating with Russia .  
Present at the meeting were leaders of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , relevant departments under central and state organs , the PLA General Staff Headquarters , all military regions and provincial military districts ( garrison commands and garrisons ) , the Air Force , key cities for the civil air defense work designated by the state , and the Civil Air Defense Offices at the city level and above ; as well as the responsible comrades of a number of colleges , universities , and scientific research institutions .  
Various experimental districts have summarized a lot of experience through practice.Deciding the boundaries of communities in a scientific and rational way is the prerequisite for building a modern and civil city .  Drawing on foreign experience and taking into account their local actual conditions , Tianjing , Shenyang , Benqi , Nanjing , Qingtao , Wuhan , Xian , Harbin and other cities decided the boundaries of a community in line with the geographical formation .  
In Long Yongtu 's opinion , one of Hong Kong 's major strong points is that it has a sound legal system and a population that has a good legal concept and a civil awareness of consciously knowing , understanding and abiding by the law .  
The circular called for placing the focus of safety production work on coalmines ( with chief emphasis on preventing gas and coal dust explosions ) , on the transport of fireworks and firecrackers , toxic and inflammable products , on public entertainment districts , on civil aviation , on railway , on waterways , and on highway transport .  As the 2001 New Year and the Spring Festival holidays are spaced close within each other , the spring transport task will be very arduous and passenger flow will be very heavy .  
It is up to the central agencies concerned as well as economically developed areas along the coast to step up the training of leading cadres and minority cadres in the west and the training of civil servants , specialized technical personnel , and enterprise managerial personnel .  
Railway , civil aviation , and water and highway transport departments and units must resolutely investigate and deal with instances of operating with faulty equipment and violations of rules and regulations such as overloading and excessive speed , and strictly check and prohibit passengers from carrying inflammable , combustible , or toxic and other dangerous items onto aircraft , trains , buses , and other transport means .  
and thus laid a solid foundation for raising its own overall standard and for its own development as well .  The corporation also sorted out a clear-cut train of thought for developing civil products , clearly identified goals ; and secured fresh progress in respect of pluralizing the principal body of investment for backbone civil products , separating civil products from military ones , listing civil products separately in production , and industrializing hi-tech civil products .  
It was learned that in the 10th Five-Year Plan period , apart from readjusting scientific research or production capacity for military products , the corporation is also expected to further streamline production of key military products ; preliminarily industrialize its scientific research and production capacity for hi-tech military products ; further develop civil products with active efforts in setting up separate production lines for such products , in separating civil products from military ones , and in listing civil products separately in production as well .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
The appointment of Donald Tsang , who is familiar with government operations , as chief secretary for administration , and the appointment of Antony Leung , who is a member of the Executive Council and a financier , as financial secretary , however , avoided a great change in the positions of senior officials , and showed the possibility of bringing qualified people in the private sector into the civil service system , thus strengthening the government .  The appointments are laudable .  
While acting as the financial secretary , he personally understood the principle of " one country , two systems " was fully put into effect , and thus enhanced his faith in serving the SAR Government and contributing to the implementation of the principle .  On the recommendation of the chief executive , the State Council appointed Donald Tsang as chief secretary for administration to coordinate government operations and lead 180,000 civil servants .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .  Stress will be laid on preventing job related crimes in coordination with financial , securities , customs , medical and pharmaceutical , building and other trades .  
The session maintains that , in the new year , the Supreme People 's Court should , in light of the requirements set for managing the country by the law and building a socialist country ruled by the law , comprehensively strengthen all its adjudicative and executive efforts , censure all forms of crime by the law , and intensify its efforts in examining civil , commercial and administrative cases with the purpose to resolve various social problems .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .  
These four crucial factors which are not going to change include the legal system ; the free entrepreneurial spirit that Hong Kong upholds and a level playing field thus created ; the clean and efficient Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) civil service ; and the free flow of information .  
We have a clean and efficient civil service .  We are a practical and hard working people .  We have a solid supporting infrastructure .  Together with the fine British legacy of the common law , we are sitting on a well-cushioned platform which would carry us comfortably into the next century . "  
The spokesman also said the Government is determined to protect the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .  These include the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field , an honest , efficient and politically neutral civil service , a first class economic infrastructure and the free flow of information .  
The Homepage depicts the work and objectives of the Economic Services Bureau on the various responsibilities under its purview , including agriculture and fisheries , civil aviation , energy supplies , financial monitoring of public utilities , maritime services , meteorological services , port development , postal services , protection of endangered species , telecommunications and tourism .  
The guarantees of a high degree of autonomy contained in the Basic Law , free-market policies , prudent fiscal management , the rule of law , a level playing field , a highly-efficient civil service , and vigorous anti-corruption action were also major factors in Hong Kong 's continued success .  
Part of Hong Kong 's success is also as a result of our promotion of free competitive environment , the strict adherence to the rule of law , minimum bureaucracy and a level playing field and a strong commitment against corruption - all provided and supported by an efficient civil service .  
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
Under the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance , a person is eligible for appointment as a judge from another common law jurisdiction if he is a serving or retired judge of a court of unlimited jurisdiction in either civil or criminal matters in another common law jurisdiction , is ordinarily resident outside Hong Kong and has never been a judge of the High Court , a District Judge or a permanent magistrate in Hong Kong .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
These systems include the rule of law ; a level playing field for doing business ; a corruption-free and politically-neutral civil service ; open and transparent financial markets ; a fast and unfettered flow of information network and last but not least , a tried and tested policy of limiting Government spending to within the trend growth rate of Gross Domestic Product .  
( b ) The Civil Service Bureau co-ordinates the assessment of non-local academic qualifications for civil service appointment purposes .  Assessment is conducted on a case-by-case basis for individual civil service job applicants to determine whether the non-local qualifications held by the applicants are comparable in standard to the local qualifications required for entry to the civil service posts concerned .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
( 3 ) To streamline further the disciplinary proceedings and to remind in particular the officers at the management level to attach importance to the strict enforcement of the disciplinary actions to ensure that an effective reward and punishment system is maintained in the civil service and to prevent the reputation of the dedicated civil service from being tarnished by a few black sheep ; and  
Three categories of prospective tenants are eligible for the new scheme : Waiting List ( WL ) applicants who are due for flat allocation in the coming financial year ; Temporary Housing / Cottage Areas and squatter clearees who have satisfied prevailing PRH eligibility criteria ; and junior civil servants under the Civil Service Public Housing Quota and Estate Assistants of the Housing Department due for allocation in the coming year .  
However , as the new millennium unfolds and in order to meet the many new challenges which Hong Kong now faces , we are also making a determined effort in civil service reform .  Our objective is to make our civil service even more efficient , accountable and responsive to changing needs .  
Prior to a decision on the civil service pay adjustment , the Government ( as the management ) consults the major civil service consultative councils ; and also takes account of the net pay trend indicators , plus other factors ( such as budgetary considerations and the prevailing social and economic conditions ) . 
" The passionate , informed and civilized argument which took place over this issue only goes to show that Hong Kong remains a free and vigilant society where decisions critical to the foundations of our civil society must be debated , discussed and dissected in an open and transparent manner . 
The SCDS consulted the department management and staff before making its recommendations .  They considered that the pay advantage which the disciplined services now enjoy over the civilian grades in recognition of their special job factors should be preserved , but some adjustment would be justified to that element of the starting salaries of recruits entering the disciplined services which is based on academic qualification benchmarks in order to maintain broad comparability with the rest of the civil service .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name a few . 
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name but a few .  
Memoranda of understanding in respect of reciprocal arrangements for the service of judicial documents in civil and commercial proceedings , and in respect of the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards were signed on 14 January and 21 June this year respectively .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
( ii ) the total number of civil proceedings for damages instituted by members of the public who suffered financial losses as a result of negligence or fraudulent acts on the part of practising solicitors , and the number of cases in which the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , as well as the average amount of damages awarded ; and  
( ii ) Where disputes on proposals about significant change in conditions of service affecting a substantial part of the civil service can not be resolved , and after exhausting proper consultation and other existing administrative channels , the matter may be referred to an independent Committee of Inquiry formed under the 1968 Agreement made between the Government and the three staff associations of the Senior Civil Service Council , namely the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants ' association , the Senior Non-expatriate officers ' Association and the Association of Expatriate Civil Servants of Hong Kong .  
The Government is now reviewing the existing disciplinary mechanism for civil servants in order to enhance the effectiveness of disciplinary action against officers involved in improper practices ; and ( d ) forming jointly with ICAC a Task Force to launch in 1999 a two-year programme entitled " Civil Service Integrity Programme " to assist departments in drawing up internal guidelines on the standards of conduct expected of their staff .  
Furthermore , we must continue to move forward with free market economy with level playing field , clear , unobstrusive and transparent business regulation , a clean and effective civil service and an outward looking society .  
I confess that looking back ten years I did have some doubts as to whether it would be acceptable for the Government 's principal adviser on civil law to be neither a Chinese national , nor , I am ashamed to say , a Chinese speaker , but clearly the terms of the Basic Law which allowed for the continuing employment of British and other foreign nationals in the public service have been followed .  
The new powers under the Bill include allowing SFC to require access to the working papers of an auditor of a listed corporation in a preliminary inquiry into alleged misconduct of the corporation ; enabling SFC to impose civil fines on intermediaries as a more proportionate disciplinary sanction ; granting SFC standing to intervene in civil proceedings between third parties to protect public interest ; and allowing SFC to take custody of clients ' assets from intermediaries to prevent dissipation of such assets .  
As an alternative to the civil proceedings before the MMT , the Bill preserves and expands the existing criminal route for dealing with market misconduct activities , to be resorted to when there is sufficient evidence to meet the criminal standard and it is in the public interest to bring prosecution before the courts .  
Explaining the new civil service entry system , a Civil Service Bureau spokesman said , " We have listened to different views expressed by the Staff Sides , departmental management and members of the public during earlier consultation .  We have substantially modified the original proposals to employ all staff in basic ranks on contract terms to the current proposal . "  
To safeguard the quality of public service , the Administration has a duty to ensure that the revised benefits are more akin to private sector practice and at the same time are attractive enough to recruit and maintain officers of suitable calibre in the civil service .  
On the other hand , because of the strong growth in public sector civil engineering output , the gross value of construction work performed at public sector sites increased by 13.0% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier to $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter of 2000 .  
" We are also accountable to the Legislative Council , now fully elected , and increasingly representative under the timetable laid down in the Basic Law . The civil service has long recognised that dynamic , and willingly accepts its responsibility in explaining , defending and arguing for its policies and proposals before legislators . " 
He said : " Apart from the continued orderly implementation of the Civil Service Reform measures which have already been announced , our work in the coming year will include strengthening the integrity of civil servants , improving communication between staff and management , promoting effective and appropriate human resource management practices and fostering the public 's trust and goodwill towards the Civil Service . "  
Briefly , its Vision is to foster a dynamic , visionary and knowledge-based Civil Service , which delivers quality service to the community through a clean , trusted , respectable and fulfilled workforce ; its Mission is to develop talented civil servants , to ensure the highest standard of integrity among them , and to empower them to contribute to and take pride in their work ; and its Core Values are Simple , Positive Thinking , Fairness , Partnership and Learning .  
( a ) of its initial assessments on the recommendations made in the Review of Employees ' Compensation System in Hong Kong , published by the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers last November , in particular about adopting a step-down approach after statutory compensations have been paid to injured workers over a certain period of time , stipulating that employees are not entitled to statutory and civil compensations at the same time , and implementing a mandatory rehabilitation programme ;  
In November last year , a first group of anglophone counsel from my department attended an excellent English language course in Mainland law at Peking University . The course included lectures on the legal system and government structure in the Mainland , and on the latest developments in constitutional , criminal , civil and administrative law .  
" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
In accordance with the provisions of the pensions legislation , all retired civil servants who have been granted a pension are required to seek prior permission from the Government to take up employment , enter into business , or become partners or directors , if the principal part of the business or employment is carried on in Hong Kong , within two years after retirement , or within three years for officers retiring at Director of Bureau rank or above .  
With the arrival of the knowledged based economy , the rapid proliferation of e-learning opportunities and our firm commitment to be a world class civil service capable of providing quality service to meet the changing needs of the community , it is essential for us to continuously strengthen and modernise our approach to training and development .  
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said : " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
To minimise corruption opportunities , the Government has devised a well-balanced strategy based on sound legislation , effective administrative measures , comprehensive education programme , independent investigation and the provision of reasonable remuneration to our civil servants .  
" It is our policy that each pay adjustment exercise is a separate annual exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time . "  He stressed : " There does not exist in this year any overriding factors which justify a departure from our long-standing and well established mechanism adopted for civil service pay adjustment . "  
During its stay in the United Kingdom , France and Germany , the delegation will meet with Ministers , senior civil servants , academics and experts in constitutional law , think-tank bodies as well as non-government organizations concerned .  They will exchange views with each other on how an effective system of executive accountability would work under a unique political structure .  
In view of the background and to uphold public confidence in the integrity of the civil service disciplinary mechanism , we are prepared to disclose , on an exceptional basis , in summary the facts that have been brought forward in the disciplinary hearings whilst preserving confidentiality of individual officers involved .  
As a world-class city , Hong Kong must provide its people with a clean and comfortable living environment .  Together , we will build a civil society in which everyone can take pride , as well as enjoy a healthy and positive lifestyle in a rich cultural environment .  
As such , they are held responsible for administrative and managerial mishaps , and for personal misconduct .  They are subject to a well-established civil service appointment , management and disciplinary system .  
First and foremost , under the concept of ' One Country Two Systems ' , we have made the historic transition while preserving Hong Kong 's core values - the rule of law , a clean , accountable civil service , the free and unfettered flow of information and ideas , and a level playing field for business .  
" On the one hand , the Administration has a responsibility to ensure that civil servants receive fair and reasonable treatment without being subjected to political influence .  On the other hand , we are duty-bound to ensure that the civil service system , including the mechanism for determining and adjusting pay levels , will continue to be accepted and supported by the public , " Mr Wong said in his letter to all civil servants .  
Hong Kong 's respected legal system , its clean civil service , the free flow of information , a stable currency and a level playing field for business were recognized as important strengths that Hong Kong should protect and leverage , Mr Tsang said .  
Noting the current difficult economic situation , Mr Tung stressed that the Government would strengthen the service-oriented culture in the civil service by improving its efficiency and quality of service and fostering a higher degree of accountability and responsiveness to public aspirations .  
On the contrary , developments in both areas can go hand-in-hand .  Both areas depend on our future lawyers being adequately educated and trained ; both areas depend upon our civil justice system being cost-effective and speedy ; and both areas depend upon our ability to identify and meet the needs of those with legal problems .  
" Our respected legal system , together with our clean civil service , a free flow of information , a stable currency and a level playing field for business is recognised as important strengths that Hong Kong should protect and leverage , " he said .  
Question : Will the Government inform this Council of the current total number of staff in all public-funded organizations and statutory bodies of which the Government is the major shareholder , and the gross amounts of their monthly salary and personal emolument-related expenditure , and provide a comparison of these figures with those for the civil service ?  
Under the current arrangements , civil servants , retired civil servants in receipt of a pension or an annual allowance and their eligible dependants are entitled to medical and dental benefits provided by the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority .  
To highlight the importance which he places on the civil service and to preserve the integrity of the Accountability System , the Chief Executive has decided , after careful consideration , that the Secretary for the Civil Service should be included as a principal official under the new system and be selected from among senior civil servants .  This will ensure that the person appointed will have a full understanding and appreciation of the civil service structure and system .  
In view of the special circumstances and the fact that the person selected for the post of the Secretary for the Civil Service is a professional career civil servant , he will be allowed to return to the civil service , if his age permits , at his original rank after his appointment as the Secretary for the Civil Service . Whether or not he would do so is a matter of personal choice .  
There are increasing calls for senior civil servants to be held accountable for policy failures , including calls for some of them to step down .  However , due to the permanence of the current system and established appointment and removal systems , the current civil service system is not compatible with these demands .  
( b ) whether the movement of the price index has all along been a major consideration in determining the size of civil service pay adjustment , and whether an alternative formula has been adopted in the light of the price index falling to a negative level ; if so , of its rationale for that ?  
Mr Wong continued : " In addition , the Principal Officials will be required as a condition of their contract to uphold the principle of maintaining a permanent , political neutral , professional and honest civil service system .  
Civil servants will continue to offer advice without fear or favour , based on intellectual rigour , objective research and an inherent professional understanding of the nature of the wider public interest born of decades of experience developed in our civil service .  
From January 2003 , applicants to civil service posts at graduate or professional level will be required to obtain a pass in the two language papers ( Use of Chinese and Use of English ) in the Common Recruitment Examination Part I ( CRE ) before making application , and those to civil service posts with entry requirements set below degree level to attain at least Grade E in Chinese Language and English Language ( Syllabus B ) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination ( HKCEE ) or equivalent . 
On the basis that women 's rights are human rights , a strategic approach for advancement of women must bear in mind the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the right to development protected by the various instruments binding on the parties to the Beijing Declaration . 
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said , " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
These included the development by the Hospital Authority ( " HA " ) of a set of patient referral guidelines which would assist not only internal referrals within HA but also where appropriate , externally to the private sector ; the identification and development of shared care programmes ; the dissemination of information on private sector services through the assistance of HA ; and the possibility of developing a medical insurance scheme for new civil service recruits with the participation of the private sector , etc . 
While the system may not be perfect , it is fair to say that by and large , it has played an important role in the development of a clean , efficient , trustworthy and quality civil service in Hong Kong .  
Apart from these broader , conceptual issues , we have also taken note of the concerns expressed by the public , as reiterated by some Members today , about a growing perceived disparity in the pay levels between the civil service and the private sector as well as the inadequacy of the existing annual civil service pay adjustment mechanism to reflect the pay adjustment trends in the market .  
In deciding to offer a negative pay adjustment across the civil service this year , we have given careful consideration to all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from the 2001 / 02 Pay Trend Survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
In order to ensure that the pay adjustment decision , if approved , will be implemented with certainty , we propose to seek the enactment of a specific piece of legislation to cater for this year 's civil service pay adjustment .  The proposed legislative approach will provide for an express reduction of civil service pay by the specified percentages and provide that each officer 's contract shall be modified to the extent of the statutory variation .  
The Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr . Joseph W P Wong , today ( May 22 ) announced that the Chief Executive in Council decided to offer to the staff sides of the four central consultative councils that civil service pay be reduced by 4.42 per cent for the directorate and the upper salary band , 1.64 per cent for the middle salary band and 1.58 per cent for the lower salary band with effect from October 1 , 2002 .  
" The decision on the pay offer has been made after careful consideration of all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale , " Mr . Wong said .  
" In the light of the prevailing economic situation , our serious budgetary position and the pay adjustment trends in the private sector , we consider that the pay offer of a negative pay adjustment in line with the net pay trend indicators is reasonable and has struck a balance between the concerns of civil servants and the interests of the community at large , " he added .  
Without attempting to repeat all the legal arguments which Law Officer ( Civil Law ) has clearly set out in his article , suffice for me to say that we have thought long and hard on this matter and have come to the conclusion that legislation is the only viable means to implement with certainty a justified decision of a modest pay reduction made strictly in accordance with the established mechanism for civil service pay adjustment . 
In my earlier letter of April 17 , 2002 , I have highlighted that the Chief Executive had , when addressing the Legislative Council on April 17 , 2002 , emphasised the importance of maintaining , under the Accountability System , a permanent , meritocratic , professional , politically neutral and honest civil service .  
As the top echelon of the Government , the new principal officials are expected to lead and contribute towards the building up of an efficient , professional , fair , clean and honest civil service .  
* provisions which stress that civil servants will continue to be appointed , managed and promoted in accordance with the prevailing rules applicable to the civil service ; and be subject to the prevailing disciplinary mechanism , under which allegations of misconduct are determined through an impartial process based on consideration of factual evidence ; 
In parallel , we shall issue a composite Civil Service Circular to ensure that all colleagues in the civil service clearly understand their role and responsibilities in relation to the new principal officials .  This circular will set out the framework within which civil servants are to work to the principal officials .  In particular , it will enunciate the core values and high standard of probity that civil servants are expected to uphold in discharging their official duties , including the following :  
Otherwise , the public at large would criticize the Government for failing its responsibility .  It would be detrimental to the overall interests of the civil service and the community if our failure to implement the pay reduction led to the impression that civil servants were unwilling to share the burden with the rest of the community in time of difficulty or our inaction meant that our severe fiscal deficit could not be alleviated .  
" Moreover , Hong Kong offers the conducive business environment and facilities to facilitate the development of the shipping industry .  These include a low tax regime , efficient banking services , excellent communications , modern infrastructures , a sound legal system , business-friendly policies , a clean and accountable civil service as well as a highly educated and skilled workforce , " she said .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
Some of the considerations under the existing mechanism such as the net pay trend indicators and the cost of living are capable of upward and downward movements .  It is thus inherent in our annual pay adjustment policy and mechanism that civil service pay may be increased or decreased .  
In response to the suggestion of the Staff Side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time .

In response to the suggestion of the staff side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is also of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time .  
The civil service will continue to be subject to the prevailing civil service disciplinary system , under which allegations of misconduct against individual civil servants are determined through an impartial process based on consideration of factual evidence .  
Miss Willis said Hong Kong has remained true to its foundations of success : the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for business ; free flow of information ; a society which respects human rights and a clean , efficient and effective civil service despite the challenges faced in the past five years .  
( ii ) the principal official will be entitled to a fixed monthly salary , provident fund contribution by the Government , paid vacation leave of 22 working days per annum , and the same medical and dental benefits and treatment available to civil servants but not any pension or end of contract gratuity payment ;  
The much cherished civil service , which was permanent , stable , meritocratic , professional , clean and politically neutral , would be maintained .  
This was mainly attributable to intensified works on some major private residential and commercial building projects , more than offsetting the scale-back in the Public Housing Programme and the tapering work on some public civil engineering projects .  
Back in 1996 , the Working Group on Occupational Safety and Health in the Civil Service was set up by the Civil Service Bureau , comprising members from the four central consultative councils , with the objective of motivating joint efforts of the management and staff sides to inculcate an occupational safety and health ( OSH ) culture in the civil service and enhance civil servants ' awareness of the subject through various educational and publicity programmes .  
As regards operating expenditure , if the additional or improved services as planned , the natural increases in such expenditure as on pension , and the fact that the civil service pay can not be adjusted by the original assumed percentage , are taken into account , the total of operating expenditure to be incurred in 2003-04 will exceed the amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast . 
The Task Force set up under the three advisory bodies has recently completed the Phase One study , which is an analytical study on recent developments in civil service pay administration in other Governments . In its Phase One Final Report , the Task Force has made recommendations on priority areas for more detailed study in the short , medium and long terms . 
If you look back objectively and separate out the expected opposing and strident statements by the staff unions , you will discover , by and large , that civil servants have handled all these challenges remarkably well .  They have quietly but surely demonstrated a genuine desire and commitment to serve the community to the best of their abilities and within the available resources .  
We still have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community .  
Besides , the Chief Executive also acknowledged that the civil service had made remarkable contributions in achieving a savings of $ 6 billion and a 10 per cent reduction in civil service establishment while assuring the quality of public services in increasing productivity under the Enhanced Productivity Programme .  
We are committed to maintaining a small but responsive and accountable government , and a permanent , meritocratic , professional , politically neutral and clean civil service . "  
Having considered relevant evidence , we have initiated disciplinary actions against the civil servants who had been negligent in carrying out their duties in accordance with the established civil service disciplinary mechanism .  We are liaising closely with the Civil Service Bureau to ensure prompt completion of all outstanding cases .  
Quoting the findings of a professional and comprehensive public opinion poll commissioned by Civil Service Bureau in October 2002 , she said : " Over 70 per cent of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80 per cent considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
According to a professional and comprehensive opinion poll we commissioned last October , over 70% of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80% considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
The improved mechanism would comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments .  
" We shall in consultation with staff develop , on the basis of the existing mechanism , an improved civil service pay adjustment which should comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments , " Mr Wong said . 
To secure public acceptance of the results of the pay level survey and the new pay adjustment mechanism , I shall set up a steering committee , comprising members from outside the civil service , to provide independent and impartial advice on the conduct of the pay level survey and other matters related to the development of the improved pay adjustment mechanism .  The steering committee will commence work next month .  
" If any civil servant is found to have provided false information or abused this special measure , the exceptional approval on sick leave granted to him will be withdrawn and the period of absence will be counted against his earned leave account .  
" To set an example of a good employer , the government has arranged that any civil servant whose household member is a confirmed atypical pneumonia case may be granted paid sick leave . "  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
The improved mechanism will comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
Should the ISSOs be the subject matter of legal proceedings decisive of an individual 's civil rights and obligations or criminal liability , the content of the relevant Orders will be the subject of argument and interpretation in a public hearing and published in a judgment made public , as required by Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill or Rights Ordinance , Cap . 383 which implements Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
( c ) Apart from the activities mentioned above , the Government , as the largest employer in Hong Kong , has always strived to provide a good working environment and challenging jobs with a view to attracting suitable Hong Kong talents overseas who meet the respective qualification requirements to join the Hong Kong civil service so as to build up a dynamic , visionary and knowledge-based civil service .  
We have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a very cosmopolitan community .

* The SCCLR seeks further views from the public on whether statutory backing should be given to the Listing Rules together with tougher statutory sanctions including civil fines against non-compliance and whether the regulation of unlisted companies needs to be improved and if so , how should this be addressed in terms of institutional change . 
We have the hardware and the software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community . 
He said : " The figure shows that disciplined grade staff who have joined the civil service on or after June 1 , 2000 have progressively been transferred to permanent terms upon the completion of a three-year probationary period provided they could achieve continued satisfactory conduct and efficient performance of work and maintain continued physical fitness .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , accompanied by the Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , met representatives from major civil service unions and departmental consultative committees today ( September 24 ) .  During the meeting , Mr Tung said that he had always regarded civil servants as the most important asset of the Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) Government , and took pride in being surrounded by a world-class team of professional and efficient civil servants .  
If all goes well with the experiment , the lay assessor 's court can be fully effected without serious problem . ( 2 ) It was also decided the types of written court verdicts should be simplified , and that besides looking into such simplification during amendment of the civil and criminal laws , the Compulsory Execution Law could be amended to give executing authorities the right to consult tax records to avoid hiding of property or false claims of debt .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
" The real issue is whether agency heads have the determination and guts to exercise their assessment responsibilities , " points out Hsu Yu-fu . The basic status of civil servants is guaranteed by law and they can not be cashiered lightly ; meanwhile those dismissed with a " D " grading will lose their pension entitlement , so departmental heads shrink from drastic action from sympathetic considerations and to avoid a backlash , which , means there is no effective way of weeding out unsuitable personnel . "  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position . Ratings , from low to high , go from designated rank to recommended rank to selected rank , with the lowest being designated rank-1 and the highest selected rank-14 ( equivalent to an office director ) .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep . It will take time and a good civil service system to build up the concept and image of administrative neutrality .  
Their businesslike atmosphere may be less entertaining for many than the witty and aggressive question time in the Chamber , yet televising has certainly contributed to a greater public awareness of their work as well as forcing ministers and civil servants to take them more seriously . As for the problem of disorderly behavior among MPs , the presence of the cameras does seem to have actually improved their conduct .  
For example , one of the most successful items in this year 's old people 's consumer exhibition by the social affairs department was undoubtedly the " old people 's manpower bank " organized by the Women 's Outreach Center . Over 300 people signed up on the spot , and in due course another 50 be came official members , including retired military officers , retired doctors , teachers , banking personnel and civil servants .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
" Many educated Taiwanese back then grieved over the island being severed from China , " Liao Yi-chin says . " With the civil service examination system discarded , the literati realized that what they had studied would no longer be of any practical use , and so they consigned their literary talents to verse . " The formerly renowned Chestnut Leaved Oak Poetry Society of Taichung takes its name from the tree described in Zhuangzi that survived because of its uselessness .  
Meanwhile the domestic tenders , which were intended to support the ROC 's own civil engineering sector , also provoked a fierce conflict between the forces of the big established operators and those of new players , and suspicions of collusion or excessive price cutting in their tenders have not been laid to rest to this day .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
In 1994 Wealth reported that the lawyer Chiu Chang , who was scurrying back and forth across the Taiwan Strait , really did n't have much professional knowledge about mainland policy and that she was prone to making exaggerated , sensationalistic statements . Chiu Chang filed a lawsuit against all 20 people on the magazine 's masthead , and because the magazine is also distributed in America , filed a civil suit in US courts as well .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
The gray roof tiles of the charming houses surrounded by mango trees make a quaint picture . The majority of residents in Chunghsing Village , the seat of the provincial government since its relocation in 1955 , consist of employees of the provincial government . The community benefits from excellent planning and facilities , and many civil servants here have enjoyed decades graced by the simple community lifestyle .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
With the ensuing civil war , Yu and his family moved to Taiwan , a country in extreme poverty and still relatively unenlightened . Yu decided to play out his role as intellectual and social critic through establishing a newspaper .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
Weng Ya-lan , a graduate of National Taipei Teachers ' College , says that this is the third year she has been sitting exams . She had been working all along as a substitute teacher in Taipei County . If not successful this time , she had planned to study for the junior and senior civil service exams and become a civil servant .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base . For instance , the civil and martial mandarins and Generals Liu and Xie have white pigment applied first , whereas the two sides of General Gan 's face are painted separately red and black , and General Fan 's face is painted inky black .

An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
Although the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights might be expensive and difficult , they should be promoted on an equal basis with civil and political rights .

In 1948 , at the end of a civil war in my country which had as its main goal the defence of democratic institutions and the re-establishment of an electoral regime which assured respect for the popular vote , the victors , instead of using arms as a means to stay in power , decided to abolish the armed forces .  
Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another .

Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
It must be built upon and strengthened , recognizing always that the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we assert are about economic and social and cultural rights just as much as about the civil and political rights on which the developed countries tend to focus so much attention .

It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .

On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .

In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
The full and equal , participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .

The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Desiring , in the interests of their citizens , to ensure equal conditions for their residence in the territories of the two Parties and , in this connection , wishing to offer the citizens of one Party who reside permanently in the territory of the other Party a legal status that is as close as possible to the legal status of the citizens of the other Party , in particular as regards civil , political , social , economic , labour , cultural and other rights ,  
It identified five areas upon which efforts should be concentrated : economic restructuring that empowered women , creating sustainable livelihoods , building stable lives and healthy communities , peace building and conflict resolution , and ethical governance and respect for civil society .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
As a result of this cooperation , which has a broad base in civil society and non-governmental organizations involved in improving the status of women , the preparatory documents for the Beijing Conference have been prepared and a system developed to establish a national capacity for putting the strategy into operation .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .  
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .

Much of its work has focused on establishing the necessary international legal and policy framework for ensuring women 's full and equal enjoyment of their rights in the political , economic , civil , social and educational fields .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by women of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights attaches special importance to the promotion of the equal status and human rights of women .  
A number of countries report that they have further reinforced the constitutional guarantees by enacting separate equality laws or amending civil , penal and family codes to ensure that women are accorded equal rights , protection , equal access and opportunities in education , employment , health and matrimonial and family matters under statutory laws .  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .

On many occasions in the past we have declared that the practice of waging indiscriminate attacks against a defenceless civilian population is a particularly heinous practice that is totally unacceptable under every standard of civil society .  
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .

their field of activity - telecommunications , atomic energy , patent law , education , agriculture , health , aviation , postal services or trade - the shared concern of the organizations of the common system was loss of competitiveness in relation to other international organizations and national civil services .  
The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
delegation considered that decision unjustified , since it linked the basic level of remuneration in the common system to non-representative remuneration levels in selected subsectors of the United States federal civil service .  
of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,

BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
to observe basic civil rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression , as had been the case in Nigeria recently with the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other prominent human rights activists , destroyed confidence in the judiciary , frightened people and impeded their empowerment .  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
Further evidence of this is the dangerous , irresponsible , uncontrolled and unregulated intrusion of this organization 's aircraft , for purposes other than providing air service , into a zone of significant international civil aviation activity and one of the most active international air corridors of the western hemisphere .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
The civil service is trying to provide specific answers to this popular concern through transparent processes that are available to ordinary citizens , who in this way can find out not only how , why and for what purpose a particular civil servant was hired , but also how much this costs the State and , above all , what that person 's actual contribution is in measurable terms of quantity , quality and cost-effectiveness .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Thus , seven preparatory studies have been undertaken in fields as diverse and important as the following : first , remuneration in the civil service ; second ; summary of audits conducted in certain Ministries ; third , rapid diagnostic assessments of Ministries that have not been audited ; fourth , administrative practices and the State of law ; fifth , analysis of the general status of the civil service ; sixth , inquiry into the image of the public sector ; and , seventh , ethics , professional conduct and motivation of State employees .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
This year 's international conferences HABITAT II , the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have marked the completion of a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored conferences which covered the full range of civil , political , economic and social issues that affect the peoples of the world .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
For decades , Central America has experienced repeated conflict and violence and has been afflicted by civil war and confrontation that left a well-known aftermath of social injustice , institutional fragility and economic disruption .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .

A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .

Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .

In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented with measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly : a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
This partnership will be built on an integrated and holistic approach to human rights , in the framework of which all rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development , are perceived as of equal importance , interrelated and mutually supportive .  
It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
The same individuals stated that this policy based on religion and its manifestations , particularly in the economic and social fields , had recently become less violent but was still being pursued by indirect means , such as the continuing presence of Indian security forces at the Golden Temple and the measures taken with regard to the civil service ( see para . 79 below ) .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
This article _ which the bulk of legal doctrine considers as jus cogens _ requires the observance of judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples during a civil war and , in the light of case law arising from international conflicts , should apply all the more so when the threat to the life of the nation is less serious .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Take note of the Preliminary Agreement on a National Reconciliation Pact , which is the outcome of a broad consultation of those representing the vital forces of the Central African nation , thereby embodying the solemn commitment of the political parties , the trade union federations and the civil society to respect the constitutional legal order and to lend full support to all initiatives to promote dialogue and national reconciliation ;  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
It was stated that numerous human rights violations stemmed from the absence of a functioning State system , including social development programmes and a national treasury to pay the salaries of civil servants .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
As a pioneering effort in the region , the Team has demonstrated extraordinary merit and extensive reach of influence and effects throughout the region , inspiring replication of approach and encouraging a broad sector of combined government and civil society participation . 
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
In general , it planned to focus on strategic policy formulation and the broad issues facing the common system , with a view to shaping the international civil service of the future .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
After nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) Monitoring Group ( ECOMOG ) intervention in Liberia , countries of the subregion , with only the limited assistance of the international community , finally succeeded in supervising the conduct of presidential and legislative elections in the country in July 1997 , under conditions generally acknowledged to be free and fair .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
We are confident that his long experience as an international civil servant and his correct assessment and proper action in implementing the United Nations reform are guarantees of the successful crowning of our efforts to have a stronger and more efficient Organization .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
As a State that has experienced first-hand all the hardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult road towards national reconciliation with active support and assistance from the United Nations , Tajikistan is convinced of the need to preserve strong and efficient peacemaking mechanisms .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
A well-educated civil service , with high professional standards and resistant to pressure from privileged groups relating to distributional issues , can also be a significant force for stable and sustainable economic policies .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
An effective response requires the implementation of all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , and fundamental freedoms of all people , in accordance with existing international human rights standards ;  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
Recognizing the catastrophic consequences of the civil war in Croatia , resolved to put an end to this situation and influence the remedying of the consequences and the building of new democratic and humane relations , the international community has prevailed upon the two warring parties to sign the Basic ( Erdut ) Agreement . This act put a stop to the civil war . 
We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Therefore , programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption , are of high priority .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
The Government of Croatia will look to cooperate with the international community in finding a proper way to harmonize the complex matrix of sometime conflicting interests of the two groups , while focusing its efforts on protecting civil liberties , human and minority rights , as well as maintaining internal security and regional peace and stability .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
Seven ad hoc expert group meetings on environment statistics , vital statistics and civil registration systems ; compilation of trade statistics ; the computerization of national accounts , international economic and social classifications ( two expert meetings ) ; review of UNESIS draft standards for data structure and metadata in international data exchange and dissemination ; ( i ) Sixty-nine recurrent publications . 
This military putsch , contrary to the basic principles of democracy , is a grave assault against the dignity and free choice of a people who rightly aspire to build a state based on the rule of law after having undergone so many years of instability and civil war .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in combating crime , especially organized crime , terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including criminal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation , civil aviation and other forms of transport , illegal trafficking in radioactive materials , weapons , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and contraband , including the illegal transfer across the border of objects of cultural , historical or artistic value .  
In addition to the regular contacts between the Steering Committee and the relevant international organizations , the multinational protection force Command in Tirana has daily contact through its civil military cell with the representatives of the main international organizations .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on the respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented with measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly : a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
The SRCF will be used for : ( i ) financing assistance to governments and regional / subregional bodies in the national , subregional and regional action programming ; ( ii ) financing assistance for the preparation of local area development programmes ( LADPs ) that respond to National Action Programmes , bearing in mind also the dual track approach for LADPs and NAPs that some countries might envisage ; and ( iii ) catalytic financing for National Desertification Funds , designed within the context of National Action Programmes . 22 .  Finance for civil society .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
The preamble common to the two International Covenants on Human Rights recognizes that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights . 
The 1968 Proclamation of Tehran reaffirmed that human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible ; in the context of that interdependence , the realization of economic , social and cultural rights is of crucial importance for the effective exercise of civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has also stated that equal attention and urgent consideration should be devoted to the realization , promotion and protection of both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights .  
In its resolution 4 ( XXXIII ) of 21 February 1977 , the Commission on Human Rights stresses the responsibility and duty of all members of the international community to create the necessary conditions for the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights as an essential means of ensuring the real and meaningful enjoyment of civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms .  
This definition is applicable to civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , and also to collective or communal rights .  
The scope of this report is too narrow for a detailed description of the numerous serious violations of rights of all kinds , whether civil and political or economic , social or cultural , considered either collectively or individually .  
It was erected into a system of government and applied for about a century accompanied by violations of human rights , both economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights .  
These collective or communal rights are to individual economic , social and cultural rights what democracy and the rule of law are to civil and political rights .  
Any transaction for the transfer of wastes is a serious violation of the right to a healthy environment and , quite obviously , of the whole set of human rights , whether individual or collective , economic , social and cultural or civil and political .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and the contemporary trend for civil society _ in partnership with Government and the private sector _ to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
The High Contracting Parties shall actively cooperate in measures to combat organized and international crime , illegal drug-trafficking , terrorism and illegal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation and civil aviation , and the illegal export of cultural values .  The High Contracting Parties shall conclude separate agreements on cooperation in these and other questions of mutual interest .  
Important results have included increased gender mainstreaming in development programming , increased possibilities for UNDP to be engaged in the development of micro finance sectors as a tool for poverty alleviation , self-employment and social integration of excluded groups , and the broadening of the institutional base for civil society organization cooperation with the United Nations system .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
The final document of the Bucharest meeting contained specific recommendations on organizing national consultative processes involving civil society with a view to elaborating and implementing national plans , integrating activities designed to strengthen national structures working for the advancement of women within the context of administrative reform , establishing cooperation mechanisms between governments and non-governmental organizations , and conducting research and gathering statistical data on the role of women in society .  
That initiative , which benefitted from substantial Government funding , had been very well received by organizations of the civil society and was the basis for the action to be taken to establish , under the supervision of an independent body composed of governmental and non-governmental representatives , minimum rules for the treatment of offenders .  
Over the next five years , Malta planned to further strengthen the administrative and legislative means available to it to combat drug trafficking , sustain its opposition to the legalization of drugs , both hard and soft , involve all the actors of civil society in a coordinated strategy of prevention and education , enhance the drug-related services available for the family and the community , if necessary calling on the voluntary sector for assistance , and establish a continuous systematic evaluation exercise of the services offered in the preventive and therapeutic field .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr .

Projects aimed at the strengthening of macroeconomic management capacity , legislative systems , the legal framework , the judiciary , civilian police and election management capacity , along with mechanisms for political reconciliation , public administration and civil service reform , inter alia , must be explored , particularly in Kosovo , taking advantage of national human resources , experience and skills .  
It was the first instrument in the world to set forth a list of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations .  
Considering further that the States Members of the United Nations , by adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , reaffirmed their commitment to the observance of fundamental human rights , their faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women , and their determination to promote , in cooperation with the United Nations , the universal observance of civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
The issue under discussion involves both conceptual as well as empirical dimensions , some of which are already under consideration by the Sub _ Commission and the Commission on Human Rights . 17 / It also involves both categories of human rights , viz . , the civil and political , and the economic , social and cultural . 
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
They constituted steps in a process towards a better understanding of the relationship between human rights and development , and a recognition that economic and social rights are as indispensable as civil and political rights .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time-frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
In its written and oral representations , Bosnia and Herzegovina pointed to the continuing problems of national reconstruction and institution-building following its protracted civil war and the new constitutional structure agreed to under the Dayton / Paris Peace Agreements .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
Governments , with the increased participation of the United Nations system , civil society , donors and the private sector , are urged to pursue the research and development of new , safe , low-cost and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods , for both men and women , including female-controlled methods that both protect against sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and prevent unwanted pregnancy .  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .

Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
After the Cairo Conference , the National Department of Health , in collaboration with other Government agencies , the private sector , civil society and donors , prepared our fourth National Health Plan , which encourages a fundamental shift in the way health services are delivered to Papua New Guineans living in urban and rural areas .  
The Office for Civil Affairs , which will be responsible for overseeing and , where necessary , conducting a number of civil affairs functions , such as civil service and economic and budgetary affairs , as well as supporting the restoration and provision , in the short run , of basic public services , such as public health , education , utilities , transport and telecommunications . 
In its written and oral representations , Bosnia and Herzegovina pointed to the continuing problems of national reconstruction and institution-building following its protracted civil war and the new constitutional structure agreed to under the Dayton / Paris Peace Agreements .  
It contains details of the sabotage carried out by a New Zealand official working in Iraq under United Nations auspices , and it urges you to investigate this crime and take steps to end violations such as this being committed by persons bearing United Nations identity documents who engage in actions that are incompatible with the most elementary norms and standards governing the work of international civil servants .  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances , or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant , may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;

The Working Group on Global Navigation Satellite Systems concluded that satellite navigation systems should be fully interoperable and transparent to the user and as a consequence recommended that the United States of America and the European Union ( EU ) develop a common definition of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) for civil and public safety services .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
UNCTADs work should therefore be guided by a dual effort at integration and collaboration : integration of its analytical , normative and technical cooperation work , and collaboration with other development-related international organizations , as well as with civil society and the private business sector . 
Despite the widely publicized habit of labelling the battles after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan as a civil war , it can be attested on clear evidence that these wars were staged by the short-sighted and injudicious leaders of Pakistan , as the prime factors and instigators of instability in both Central and South Asia , who , in collaboration with backward and obscurantist elements , pursued their expansionist objectives in Afghanistan .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .  
The rights of Afghan citizens are protected under the Covenants on political and civil , economic , social and cultural rights , the Geneva Conventions and other international instruments to which Afghanistan is a party , and they must be respected .  
In this regard , attention was drawn to the relevant international conventions to which Kuwait had acceded ; 8 the inclusion in its bilateral agreements in the field of civil aviation of provisions relating to the safety of aviation ; its support for international and regional efforts to counter terrorism ; and its adoption of a series of practical and executive measures to protect its domestic security .  
According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
The results of the latter meeting are expressed in the Rio Declaration , which confirms shared principles and goals regarding trade integration as well as a mutual commitment to the full and unrestricted preservation of democratic institutions and to free , just and open electoral processes , emphasizing the importance of the participation of civil society .  
Following the rejection of the constitutional reforms in the national referendum on 16 May , the Follow-up Commission , a body established under the peace agreements with the authority to reschedule the parties commitments , has dedicated its attention to developing a viable peace agenda , which would enable the completion of the third phase of the timetable , in consultation with those sectors of civil society that are directly involved in the implementation process .  
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .

At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
The meeting concluded that successful gender mainstreaming is more likely to take place in countries where responsibility for it is not located in a single governmental body and where civil society is actively involved in advancing gender-equality issues .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In collecting information during the four visits for the preparation of the present report , meetings were held with a wide range of personalities from various sectors of Rwandan society : branches of the Government , civil society , members of diplomatic missions and members of United Nations agencies , as well as with some national and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) involved in human rights and related matters in Rwanda .  
The objective is to give the new members of the National Human Rights Commission the opportunity to meet and share views with their colleagues from other parts of the world , representatives from the National Assembly and the Government , the judiciary and civil society , as well as to engage in a wide public debate on how the Commission can be made an independent and effective institution on the basis of recognized international norms .

Strengthening of the legislative process through assistance with the drafting of legislation and the encouragement of dialogue with civil society to promote informed debate on public policy matters with human rights implications , especially in the domains of economic , social and cultural rights ;  
At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .  
Nevertheless , in spite of the picture of suffering and contrasts which the continent presents to the world ; in spite of the upheavals that wrack its civil societies ; and in spite of all the difficulties draining its capacity to steer its own way through a troublesome environment , Africa has taken the costly and demanding road of renewal that is so necessary if it is to assume control of its own destiny and to achieve a balanced world situation in the future .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Given the continuing volatile security situation in East Timor , the successor force to INTERFET should have a robust operational mandate .  24 .  As indicated in the first periodic report , it is imperative that urgent steps be taken to address the absence of effective civil administration in East Timor and that the civil administration elements of UNTAET be brought forward as much as possible .  
Among them are an elected Government that enjoys widespread legitimacy within the population a rare fact in the aftermath of a war ; a strong and active civil society ; a fabric of national cohesion , without significant polarization along ethnic or religious lines ; a land endowed with rich soil and considerable mineral resources ; and a tradition of higher education .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .  
This fellowship programme aims to give participants , in particular mid-level diplomats and national civil servants dealing with international issues , access to comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills , and possibly other related subjects .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
At the legislative level , womens civil status continued to be restricted ; despite the ratification of international instruments , the offending provisions in the laws had not been amended .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .  
Recalling further that these initiatives called for , inter alia , discussions on these themes on the basis of in-depth reports at the global , regional and national levels by intergovernmental , governmental , diplomatic , academic and civil society3 experts at conferences , seminars and other meetings as well as through the Internet , to be reported on to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session ,  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
He concluded that such cases must not have occurred in his jurisdiction since the Cameroonian public knew perfectly well to whom it could complain , that is , to the divisional superintendent or to his fourth assistant , responsible for civil security and investigation of police officers , and that he was not aware of any such complaint being lodged .  
The requirement , under the revised methodology , that the public sector should be represented by at least 25 per cent of the employers surveyed was a violation of the Flemming principle , since not all national civil services accurately reflected the best prevailing local conditions .  
It was high time that the basic rights recognized for national civil services and enshrined in ILO Conventions No . 98 and No . 154 should be recognized , with appropriate adjustments , for the international civil service , since it was unthinkable that ILO and the international financial institutions should fail to apply internally the basic rules they would like to see implemented internationally .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
MICIVIH currently has responsibility for providing institutional assistance ( with particular reference to the police , judiciary , the penal system , the Ombudsmans Office and civil society organizations ) , supporting the promotion and protection of human rights and verifying observance of individual rights , fundamental freedoms and due process requirements .

Pakistan was concerned by the reference in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 , para . 60 ) to the fact that the Working Group on Common Indicators , established by the United Nations Development Group , was developing civil and political rights indicators to complement existing economic and social indicators .  
The Special Rapporteur notes that the civil society , including NGOs , the media and private individuals , has often been instrumental in pressing the competent authorities to launch inquiries into incidents of extrajudicial killings or to reopen investigations into cases already considered closed .  
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;

Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

They understand the laws that are relevant to their activities through commentaries and publications ranging from government and professional gazettes to the documents of interest groups and the public media , and the viability of these in providing diverse , accurate and accessible information is an important support structure for the rule of law in civil societies .  
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development ( Agenda for Development ( General Assembly resolution 51 / 240 , annex ) , para . 
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .

The view was expressed that an educational institution should have been included among the public non-profit sector employers in order to have at least one employer working in the same substantive field as UNESCO , instead of four financial sector employers . 6 Furthermore , it would have been preferable if a more representative employer such as the French career civil service or the Ministry of Culture ( instead of the Snat ) , had been included . 
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
The main purpose of these conferences , held with the direct and active participation of young people , was to raise the general publics awareness of the goals set and the commitments undertaken by Governments , to promote dialogue with the decision makers on follow-ups and to encourage an active involvement of young people , civil society and the local governments in the implementation of the relevant national plans of action .

This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .

In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
My delegation intends to play an active role in the preparations for the informal process , seeking to ensure broad input from all relevant actors , including regional organizations , various parts of the United Nations and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 , including civil society .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .

At the provincial level , the Kosovo Transitional Council continued to meet regularly to carry out its duties , and invited representatives of civil society , political parties , religious groups and national communities to participate .  
Like the CCA , it is countrydriven , prepared with the broad participation of civil society , key donors and other relevant international finance institutions , and linked to agreed international development goals .  
On the civil service level , it is often motivated by salaries so low and so infrequently paid that public servants are forced to choose between service to their country and meeting their families basic needs .  
There is , however , a recognized lack of substantive global or national attention and research on the particular vulnerability of these children or the promotion of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
If there is to be a genuine commitment to human rights in a holistic fashion , then these institutions must pay attention to both civil and political rights , as well as to economic , social and cultural rights .  
This instrument recognizes the right to an adequate standard of living , social security , the right to work and just and favourable conditions of work , and the right to education , in addition to traditional civil and political rights .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
This taboo has now been shattered and it is with extreme satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur notes the growing commitment of civil society in countries affected by harmful traditional practices , especially female genital mutilation .  
We agree that there should be a broad approach to the issue of human rights which covers civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and which is based on respect for the dignity of persons and protection of their fundamental rights .  
During the special debate on poverty and the enjoyment of human rights held during the fiftysixth session , there was repeated insistence that all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social were at stake in situations of poverty .  
It also takes into consideration the full range of indivisible , interdependent and interrelated rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
Effective and meaningful collaborative efforts are required , involving Governments , multilateral development institutions , bilateral donors , the private sector , civil society and other relevant stakeholders , to enhance the developmental impact of ICT .  
To date , due to deficient budgetary resources the salaries of State civil servants can not be raised to the required level ; hence , the appreciation of intellectual work is descending .  
Our vision includes a special role for the dynamism of young people and the experience of the elderly , and reaffirms the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
Stop imposing economic sanctions , which deprive people of their basic economic , social and environmental rights and which make their struggle for survival , as well as for civil and political rights , more difficult . 
Nonetheless , it is a bitter fact that economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , have not received the same , consistent and programmed support as civil and political rights .  
First , respect for human rights and the effective exercise of all rights political , civil , economic , social and cultural must be seen not only as an ethical requirement but also as an element of economic and social development .  
How can we spread the implementation of human rights across the globe so that the practice of rights economic , social and cultural , and civil and political can foster cultures of respect and tolerance , in the framework of fundamental human rights ?  
It contains a complete set of a good thirty articles devoted to human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political .

Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development ;  
The history of our countries in the decade just past has been marked by a plethora of bloody national and civil conflicts and an unprecedented intensification of ethnic , political and social enmity , xenophobia and alienation .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
In light of the work of the Committee and of the latest scientific research , it is obvious that economic , social and cultural rights are as justiciable as civil and political rights .  
Welcomes the hearings held with civil society to support the financing for development process , looks forward to the contribution of the upcoming hearings with the private sector , and encourages the deepening of these efforts in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ;  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
If new , more flexible contractual arrangements were to be developed so as to respond to the changing requirements of employing organizations , they would need to be within an overall , standard framework that ensured the continued existence and viability of the international civil service .  
They do not exempt international civil servants from observing local laws , nor do they provide an excuse for ignoring private legal or financial obligations .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
In conclusion , I should like to say that I was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors and of Congolese people of all persuasions to preserve their national unity ; by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country ; and by the resilience and determination of local communities and the youth .  A united , peaceful and vigorous Congo is good for Congolese children .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
Other actors , such as regional organizations , the international financial institutions and civil society , also have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen their capacity to respond to factors such as exclusion and inequality , which , if left unchecked , can spark violent confrontations .  
If international and regional conflicts were once a result of the cold-war climate that then prevailed , the past decade , which saw the end of the cold war , was marked by regional and civil strife that was more brutal , more tragic and more devastating than the conflicts of the cold-war era .  
Suffice it to say that we are deeply concerned not only by the casual manner of according a parallel status to this bunch of discredited criminals , but also by the dilution of and utter disregard for the popular will of Somali civil society , which has throughout borne the full brunt of egregious human rights violations perpetrated by the same individuals . 
The United Nations Development Group and the people of East Timor trust that the Council will find the means to guarantee that the United Nations , complemented by generous voluntary contributions , can complete the tasks it was charged with : to put in place not only support elements for the fledgling civil service , but also major programmes for long-term capacity-building and poverty eradication .  Thus will we help put in place a strong , confident and capable Government in East Timor with the capacity and the commitment to meet the needs of all its citizens .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
He described the right to development as a vector composed of various elements including the right to food , the right to health , the right to education , the right to housing and other economic , social and cultural rights , as well as all the civil and political rights together with the rates of growth of GDP and other financial , technical and institutional resources that enable any improvement in the well-being of the entire population and the realization of the rights to be sustained .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
His Government planned to involve civil society , particularly non-governmental organizations , in implementing the new approach and was engaged in consultations with them on a number of issues ( inter alia , improving the living conditions of displaced persons in camps , protecting their civil rights , implementing job-creation projects for them , improving understanding of the basic principles of the new UNHCR approach ) .  
All forms of human rights civil , cultural , economic , social and political are integral and indivisible rights of our peoples .

The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
The member countries had at their disposal various regional and international legal instruments to guide them in the defence and promotion of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which had been ratified by all the member countries of the Rio Group , and the instruments drawn up by the Inter-American Childrens Institute , founded in 1927 with the aim of supporting policies relating to childhood , fostering the bonds between the State and civil society , and shaping a regional awareness of the problems of children . 
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
Chile was a nation acting in full unison with the international community , possessed of a civil society that was increasingly involved in national affairs , a respect for human rights and the rule of law and courts that dispensed justice strictly and responsibly , a nation with an open , booming economy , which was working steadily to do away with inequalities .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
Three major issues have emerged from the workshops and consultations held and the feedback from country teams that have been involved in consultations with the World Bank as well as from the joint learning group on the CDF and PRSPs , which meets periodically and maintains continual electronic contact among its members : ( a ) enhancing national ownership of processes ; ( b ) improving participation of different actors , particularly civil society ; and ( c ) ensuring a substantive contribution of UNDP and the other United Nations agencies and entities .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,

During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Likewise , it was considered prudent to retain the primacy of the sectoral conventions since they included specific and more elaborate provisions on the acts in question , for example in the field of civil aviation and maritime safety , which were not included in the comprehensive convention .  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;

Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
There are encouraging signs of a nascent democratic process involving broad segments of Angolans , including civil society , on the need for the drafting of a new Constitution , the debate over a new press law and on the need to ensure free and fair elections in late 2002 .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting womens rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of womens rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .

Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,

As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
The period following his election , until his inauguration as President on 7 February was marked by a concerted civil society effort to promote political dialogue ; questionable opposition moves to form an alternative government ; and a climate of tension and threats accompanied by intermittent bombings .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code , a code on criminal procedures , a new civil code and a code of civil procedure , the reform of the administration of justice and enhancing the training of judges and lawyers , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The United Nations system should be conscious of these perceptions ; point to the accountability and transparency mechanisms that are built in the functioning of the different agencies ( from the tripartite structure of ILO , to the requirements for parliamentary ratification of World Trade Organization legal instruments ) ; and continue to expand its outreach to all elements of civil society , from parliamentarians and local authorities to professional societies .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .  
Both these undertakings require an effective , trained and motivated workforce , operating within the confines of professionally managed establishments that are capable of undertaking major civil engineering work on an ongoing basis .  
Specifically designed to ensure an inclusive approach , the JWG is composed of representatives of the three major Kosovo Albanian political parties , a Kosovo Serb member ( who withdrew following the initial session and was replaced on 13 April by another representative of the Kosovo Serb community ) , a Bosniac who represented Kosovos other minority communities , a representative of civil society and an independent expert , as well as seven international members , including an international chairman .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Greater emphasis should be placed on teaching the history of national , racial , linguistic , cultural , religious and ethnic minorities [ and of the history of neighbouring countries ] with the aim of achieving mutual respect and understanding for others culture , religion or history / as well as of their contribution to the whole civil society ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
We are convinced that the United Nations system is uniquely placed to play a key role in supporting Africas efforts and to help create a momentum for a productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector .  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
The members of these Councils included representatives of teachers , parents , students and government authorities at the municipal , departmental and national levels and , where appropriate , representatives of indigenous organizations , the private sector , universities and other sectors of civil society connected with educational development .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Preparations for the practical establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission were given impetus by a seminar on operational and managerial aspects of the Sierra Leone truth and reconciliation commission held in Freetown from 29 May to 1 June 2001 , and attended by representatives of the Government and the local diplomatic community , civil society organizations and the UNAMSIL leadership . 
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
Secondly , he discussed the Programme for Comprehensive Development of Indigenous Communities which had four main components : the financing of economically productive initiatives aimed at raising the standard of living , health services that combined traditional and occidental medicine , intercultural bilingual education aimed at strengthening ancestral culture and , finally , strengthening of indigenous communities and capacity-building of civil servants working with the indigenous population .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors of Congolese society to preserve their national unity , by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country , and by the resilience and determination of local communities and young people .  A united , peaceful and vigorous country is good for Congolese children , it is good for the development and future of Africa and it is good for international peace and security .  
It was greatly heartened to witness the sterling work of those delegations and members of civil society that have , in a few short years , transformed the anti-landmines movement into a workable convention , whose provisions are respected not only by the ever-increasing number of States parties but also by non - parties , whose actions are coloured by the moral strength of the Convention .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
Tajikistan has suffered from a severe drought over the past two years , which has severely compounded the economic problems created by several years of civil conflict that resulted in destruction of the basic social and economic infrastructure and a sharp decline in living standards .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
Invites Member States , in collaboration with the United Nations organizations and civil society , to place a renewed focus on the issue of improving the situation of rural women in implementing at both national and international levels the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome document6 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session , taking into account also the conclusions and recommendations of the United Nations expert group meeting on the situation of rural women within the context of globalization , held in 2001 , by , inter alia :  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information , including the possible establishment of a database for research and analysis , and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Debt relief was one way to free resources for investment and poverty eradication , but , if it was genuinely to improve economic and social conditions in the poorest countries , it must be accompanied by sound domestic economic and budgetary policies , supported by the civil society of the countries concerned .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
Recognizing that the right of human beings to live free from fear and poverty can not be realized unless , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international human rights instruments , conditions are created enabling all human beings to enjoy to the full their economic , social and cultural rights , as well as their civil and political rights ,  
Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;  
It is recommended that the executive , judicial and legislative branches , together with the private sector and civil society , act together to promote the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development ;  
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;

With regard to the possible appointment of an independent expert on the issue of impunity , the Commission stated that , as impunity is a complex topic , impunity for violations of civil and political rights and for violations of economic and social rights give rise to different problems and should be treated separately . 
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .  
Acknowledges that the establishment of an effective and functioning governmental administration is crucial to fostering a stable and secure social , economic and political environment in East Timor , and in this regard urges the international community to continue to support efforts aimed at institution-building and training of civil servants , in particular in the areas of public finances , the judiciary , senior management and the development and maintenance of the central administrative systems of government ;

Recognizing the importance of continuing international support to the national efforts of the Governments and civil societies of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine , as the most affected countries , to mitigate and minimize the persisting negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the sustainable development of the affected areas as a result of the radiological , health , socio-economic , psychological and environmental consequences of the disaster ,  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .

Recognizing the need to harness synergies and to create cooperation among the various Information and Communication Technologies initiatives , at the regional and global level , currently being undertaken or planned to promote and foster the potential of Information and Communication Technologies for development by other international organizations and civil society ,  
Encourages effective contributions from and the active participation of all relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the Information and Communication Technologies Task Force , and encourages other intergovernmental organizations , including international and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society and the private sector , to contribute to , and actively participate in , the intergovernmental preparatory process of the Summit and the Summit itself ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , the United Nations system and international and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , in close collaboration with the interim authority and Afghan civil society , when conditions on the ground permit , all possible humanitarian , financial , technical and material assistance for the Afghan population , especially in the areas most affected by the drought , as well as assistance to promote the voluntary , safe and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Because of the expansion and the increase in travel within the Mission area it also planned to replace obsolete or faulty mobile phone sets provided to political and civil affairs units , and , therefore , the electronic voice mail system known as CarLog is requested in 2002 .  
Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
Implementing integrated policies for poverty reduction , primarily by facilitating adjustment to economic reform policies , raising professional qualification and general and technical education levels , creating work opportunities for nationals of Arab countries , rationalizing and making proper use of available resources , promoting social solidarity , creating practical solutions to the debt problem and strengthening the role and participation of the private sector and civil society in the formulation and implementation of sustainable development programmes ;  
Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .  
His approach to human rights is global and comprehensive , thus including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; he intends to pay serious attention to poverty as a fundamental human rights issue ;  
At the national level , each LDC with the support of its development partners will promote implementation of the actions contained in the Programme of Action by translating them into specific measures within their national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers , common country assessments , and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue ;  
Reiterates the importance of joint efforts in pursuing the established goals of the Programme of Action by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , greater involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , availability of financial resources , and ensuring international cooperation and support in the spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing ;  
The use by a public official who exercises jurisdiction or civil or political authority or holds an executive administrative position or position in a judicial body of the authority or power conferred by public office or functions in favour of or against the electoral chances of a political candidate , party or movement ;  
UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
We have been all the while upholding the rule of law , keeping an efficient and administration-oriented government as well as honest and competent civil servants .  We have continuously improved qualifications of our working population , promoted free enterprise and free trade , ensured the free flow of information , maintained a stable budget system and healthy financial mechanism , pursued a prudent public financial policy and implemented a simple and clear low rate of taxation .  
He said that , we should diligently summarize and promote these good experiences , establish a system to encourage competition and diligence and honesty in managing state affairs , and a contingent of national civil servants that regard the serving of the people as their goal , that maintain close links with the masses , that are capable and highly efficient , that are of honest and devoted to their duties , so as to strengthen the vigor and vitality of the government agencies .  
The system of holding open trials for civil cases and administrative counterappeals should be carried out and improved .  We should strengthen the supervision and restrictions over such prosecution procedures as reporting crimes , conducting preliminary investigations , placing cases on file , adopting compulsory measures , dropping cases , disapproving arrests , not instituting legal procedures , and appealing for reexamination .  
Forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high-speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries . 
Over the last year , the form and scope of making procuratorial work open have continued to broaden - - we have established a procuratorial work report system and a rights and obligations briefing system ; we have experimented on a system to open examination of civil and administrative counterappeal cases , nonprosecution cases , and criminal petition cases ; and procuratorial work has been made more transparent , which has been well received by the public .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
Governments at all levels should adjust the expenditure structure , guarantee the issuance of basic livelihood allowances for laid-off workers , pensions for retired personnel , minimum livelihood guarantee allowances for urban residents , and salaries for civil servants in full amounts and on time .  The building of the social security system should be further improved .  Resolute actions should be taken to crack down on activities of producing or selling counterfeit and inferior products , thus protecting the interests of consumers .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
some people , seeing others getting rich ahead of them , become mentally unbalanced , are no longer content with the salaried way of life of civil servants , stay aloof from the workers and peasants , draw close to " big money , " and gradually change from small fishing to big corruption .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
have built an omnidirectional stationary civil telecommunications network in light of needs of economic construction and market ; and have built an optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up some rural villages or small towns .  Thus in staging military exercises ;  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
And as to making our civil air defense organs " quasi-militarized " , we need to intensify civil air defense organ building .  Through constant building , we need to turn our civil air defense organs at all levels in the entire northeast China region into " quasi-militarized " administrative organs with political and ideological firmness , strong and effective unity , excellent professional skills , efficient organizational command , honest and clean administration , and a good administrative climate .  
After the Criminal Procedural Law was amended in 1996 , administrative detention was rescinded .  As this prevents prolonged detention in some cases , the improper adoption of coercive measures has been reduced , and people 's civil rights have been better protected .  At the same time , this does not produce any negative impact on the effectiveness of cracking down on crimes . "  
What is even more exasperating is , no one knows how does this Saddam possess such a remarkable supernatural power , but he somehow has managed to make civil aircraft from some countries , including US allies , to fly one after another into Baghdad in spite of the ban .  The " no flight zones " masterminded by the United States with painstaking efforts have thus been reduced to fragments .  The Americans have suffered a severe case of losing face .  
The " Covenant " actually confirms such basic human rights as the right of survival and the right of development .  It points out : Only after the creation of the economic , social , and cultural rights that can be enjoyed by all people , as the creation of the same conditions for civil and political rights available to all people , will the ideal freedom which frees mankind from terror and shortage be realized .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
But it still goes back to the same old question , that is , without the initiative of civil society , without the basis of full-scale economic division and full-scale division of social interests , and without the existence of a lenient and compromising political culture that is organically associated with such division of the socio-economic structure , it will end up with the same predicament of " quasi-multiparty system " in the early ROC years if what we have is merely the aspiration for the superficial efficacy of multiparty system .  
Zhang Xiaoling , a professor at the Central Party School who has been devoted to the specialized study of " women and human rights , " further expounded that according to the International Human Rights Charter , human rights can be classified into two categories - - civil and political rights and economic , social , and cultural rights .  
Developing socialist democracy must be combined with making socialist democracy a systematic and legalized affair ; we must follow the law , strictly enforce the law , pursue violations of law , and also integrate ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , so as to ensure that all work in the state proceeds in smooth fashion , ensure good economic and social order , and ensure the civil rights and legitimate interests of the masses .  
This consensus confirms : The " International Civil Aviation Convention , " signed in Chicago in 1994 , is definitely not applied to military aircraft and national aircraft , but respecting and observing the related rules and the basic demands of the Convention is conducive to ensuring the safety of both sides ' military and civil aircraft flying over the international airspace .  
Apart from similar stipulations on a country 's territorial airspace and legal status , the " International Civil Aviation Treaty , " concluded in Chicago in 1944 , in order to strictly classify the different legal status between civil and military aircraft , clearly stipulates in Article 3 : " The national aircraft of a signatory must not fly over the airspace of another signatory or land on its territory without special permission or other form of permission and abide by its rules . "  
China assigns importance to the development of friendly ties with Lebanon and is happy to see Lebanon ending its civil war , achieving national conciliation , recovering the occupied territories in Southern Lebanon , and restoring political stability .  He wished that Lebanon would be able to make still greater achievements in economic recovery and reconstruction .  
Wu Quanxu , deputy chief of the General Staff Department , who had come to direct the training exercise , told us reporters : In order to protect people 's life and property and reduce to a minimum possible losses during a nuclear accident , the PLA has established and refined a rescue command system marked by integration of military forces with civil forces , peacetime needs with wartime needs , and forces of three services and have cultivated capabilities of launching an emergency rescue operation in all types of nuclear power accidents .  
An official in Shenzhen who is familiar with the conditions of the reform of the civil service system said that if the experiments of openly recruiting intermediate-level officials from society were proved successful , then before 2010 such practice may be extended to the posts at the level of vice minister and vice provincial governor .  
He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
When giving a briefing about Cambodian 's domestic situation , Hun Sen said : Under the leadership of King Sihanouk , Cambodia terminated the civil war and the consequent domestic turmoil which lasted many years , realized national reconciliation , and moved onto the path of national reconstruction with the cooperation of all political parties inside the parliament .  
Zhang Fusen stressed that in performing the work of popularizing laws in the next five years , emphasis will be laid on the key points and efforts will be made to attain still more remarkable progress in the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , the training of civil servants , and the education on legal system among youngsters and students , so as to ensure that the popularization of laws will make a good start at a still higher standard in the new century .  
Of the big three links , only the issue of direct air links has remained unsettled .  If the government is anxious to see the big three links coming into force , the Mainland Affairs Council should handle this issue in accordance with the Hong Kong mode , namely , authorizing an unofficial representative from the civil aviation sector to sign an agreement with the mainland side .  
In accordance with the overall plans for stopping the source and blocking the flow of drugs , public security and anti-narcotics departments as well as border defense , customs control , railroad , communications , civil aviation and other related departments in Yunnan , Guangxi and Guizhou in China 's southwestern region have further improved their investigation networks as well as their comprehensive multi-force joint operations , thus effectively cutting off the frantic infiltration of drugs into our country .  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
In accordance with their international obligations and national laws and regulations , the two parties will take effective steps to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of legal and human entities of one party in the territory of the other party , and will provide each other with the necessary assistance in civil and criminal adjudication .  
It has been learned that in accordance with the overall plan of cutting off the supply and checking the spread of drugs , public security organs in charge of narcotics control as well as departments in charge of border defense , Customs , railways , communications , and civil aviation in all localities have further perfected their anti-drug networks , launched an all-positioned combined campaign against drug-related crimes participated in by different services under the Police Force , and has effectively checked a frenzied infiltration of drugs into China from outside the country .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
The average annual indirect income should come to 150 to 200 billion yuan if calculated according to a ratio of one-to-two to three ( a conservative estimate ) between direct incomes from civil aviation and the indirect incomes ( tourist , insurance , and postal earnings for instance ) .  
In this connection , I suggest removing provincial civil aviation administrative bodies and putting into practice a model of vertical administration of the regions by the state , establishing a unified system of air regulation in civil aviation , and strengthening investment in air control systems and insofar as possible adopting the world 's most advanced air control techniques and equipment .

The draft law specifically stipulates that it is the exclusive authority of the NPC and its standing committee to legislate the ten categories of laws that have a bearing on the state 's basic political system , economic system and legal system including civil and criminal laws , an authority that covers such fields as the deprival of civil and political rights , the punishment in terms of restricting the right to personal freedom , and litigation and arbitration systems .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
Policy steps such as issuing treasury bonds , sharply lowering interest rates , taxing interest , and raising civil service salaries strengthened individual buying power , to play a key role in pulling sustained economic growth and promoting higher economic efficiency on one hand , while promoting a gradual consumer price rebound on the other .

Procuratorates , people 's courts , civil affairs departments , finance departments , women 's federations , propaganda departments , departments in charge of comprehensive management of public order , and other departments should perform their respective duties and functions , make concerted efforts to tackle problems in this regard , and coordinate closely with one another in continuously deepening the special struggle to " crack down on abduction and trafficking in women and children . " 
The " political power machine " which the KMT built while it was ruling the mainland was not completely destroyed during the KMT-CPC civil war , and after arriving in Taiwan it was concentrated , mended , and reformed into what is now this deformed " political power machine " which is " a province but not a province , not a state but claiming to be a state , and neither fish nor fowl . "  After taking up power , Chen Shui-bian can hardly resolve this problem for the time being .  
The circular also particularly stressed that labor protection agencies , civil affair departments , and social security insurance organs at all levels should conscientiously change their work style , understand in a timely fashion the opinions and demands expressed by laid-off workers , retirees , and financially-troubled entities .  They should resolve in a timely fashion the difficulties and problems with which the people are most dissatisfied .  In addition , they should report the situation to relevant departments of a higher level .  
In the past 50 years , the Chinese Government has not only basically provided enough food and clothing for 1.2 billion people and greatly raised the people 's living standards , but also allowed the people to enjoy civil , political , economic , social , cultural , and educational rights on the basis of the Constitution and law .  We can say that China 's current human rights situation is in the best period in history .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
In the meantime , the two sides maintained that to look at the political , economic , social , cultural and civil rights , particularly the right to development in a comprehensive [ English version uses " balanced " ] manner and in the right perspective is of special significance to all countries .  
When headed by Vice Mayor Wang , the city government housing bureau was found to have violated the rules and developed unwanted houses in Meilin First Village and many other projects , thus sparking protests from several hundred home buyers , who were civil servants .  It was understood that the civil servants were unhappy with the housing bureau 's illicit transfer of some projects to Wang Ju 's son .  
After the all-out civil war broke out , the party again made in a timely fashion a set of correct policy decisions in light of the major changes taking place in the situation at home and abroad , which helped achieve victory in the war of liberation and found New China .  
The SAR Government has attached great importance to studying and resolving problems left over from British rule such as bubble economy , overly narrow industrial structure base , excessive expenditure , cramming-style education , and the practice of civil servants eating from the same big pot , and has set reform targets to meet the challenge of the new economic era .  
( 11 ) The interested parties are social public welfare institutions and social welfare enterprises in the charge of civil administrative departments such as welfare institutes , orphanages , homes for the elderly , hospitals for disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and servicemen , mental hospitals , and SOS [ as published , acronym given in English ] children villages .  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
All of the original civil , economic ( intellectual property ) , and communications divisions applied the civil procedure law when trying cases , and all the cases they tried were related to the legal relations between equal and civil entities .  However , through the current restructuring , all of the economic ( intellectual property ) cases and communications and transportation cases have been incorporated to the major category of civil justice .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .  As a major readjustment of the civil justice , this will exert a positive and far-reaching influence on the practice and theoretical study of China 's justice .  
The fourth civil division has been set up to counter the situation that maritime cases and the commercial cases involving foreigners as well as Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots have increased by a large number along with the constant expansion of opening-up .  With this division , the trial work will take up the challenge from economic globalization .  
Supreme People 's Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan said today at a briefing on reform of the court structure that in order to meet the new demands and challenges on judicial work resulting from economic globalization and China 's WTO accession , the Supreme People 's Court will carry out a major reform of the court establishment and set up the no . 4 civil cases court specifically to deal with maritime affairs and law and disputes involving foreign and Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan businessmen .  
Charged with the onerous and complex tasks of fixing posts for personnel and locating posts for some personnel , local organizational and personnel departments have formulated policies to advance reform in the spirit of being responsible for every civil servant , organizing the competitive assignment of posts and two-way choosing .  
Appointment to posts by competition has now developed from being a transitional means in the early stage of instituting the civil servant system into a systematized and standardized method of selecting and employing people by which civil servants are promoted , posts rotate , and people are selected for popular posts ; and the scope of appointment to posts by competition has expanded from middle-grade leading cadres to non-leadership posts and departmental leadership posts .  
Amid the series of eye-catching reforms of the cadre and personnel system , appointment to posts by competition has become a glittering point , which has opened up people 's vision regarding selection and employment , effectively prevented unhealthy trends in employing people , and reduced to the minimum the phenomenon of " selecting the wrong person " in cadre selection ; it has played a positive role in building a high-quality civil service force and allowing the emergence of more outstanding talent .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
It is closed that there is great potential for cooperation of mutual benefit between China and Russia . For example , cooperation in the fields of petroleum , natural gas , nuclear energy , machine building , civil aviation , telecommunications and aviation [ sic ] will be discussed by the Chinese and Russian prime ministers during their regular meeting in Beijing this October .  
From the automobile industry to the civil aviation industry , and to sales of color televisions , enterprises , facing fierce market competition , are flaunting the banner of " developing national industries and standardizing market competition . "  They have conducted various summits and formed price alliances to formulate minimum prices or maintain prices .  The trend of the practice of industrial monopolies is growing bigger and stronger .  
3 .  Railway , civil aviation , and transportation departments and enterprises should take resolute steps to stop the operation of any transportation vehicles that have mechanical problems .  In addition , the phenomena of violating safety regulations , such as over-loading , over-speeding , and violation of traffic regulations , should be resolutely stopped .  Passengers who carry with them flammable , explosive , poisonous , and dangerous articles should be strictly inspected .  They should be prohibited from taking transportation vehicles so as to ensure transportation safety .  
and attained attention-attracting accomplishments as follows : China has strategically changed the guiding concepts governing civil air defense .  China has simultaneously enhanced both civil air defense facilities and urban construction ; strengthened the security of key targets ;  
We should seize opportunities , and accelerate the pace of upgrading our civil air defense projects .  Within a relatively short time , we should strive to establish and develop an organizational and command system that is unified and highly efficient , a protective engineering system that is rationally structured , a telecommunications and alarm system that is sharp and reliable , a contingent of specialized personnel who are highly competent , an effective system for dispersing the population , and a system for facilitating modern scientific research and cultivating talents .  
The Russian experts believed that China 's civil aviation strength and scientific and technological strength for national defense , including China 's ship management equipment , electronic products , and so on , are already among the most advanced in the world .  After visiting some academies of sciences and aircraft production plants in China , the Russian experts concluded that China has already attained the standard required for cooperating with Russia .  
Present at the meeting were leaders of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , relevant departments under central and state organs , the PLA General Staff Headquarters , all military regions and provincial military districts ( garrison commands and garrisons ) , the Air Force , key cities for the civil air defense work designated by the state , and the Civil Air Defense Offices at the city level and above ; as well as the responsible comrades of a number of colleges , universities , and scientific research institutions .  
Various experimental districts have summarized a lot of experience through practice.Deciding the boundaries of communities in a scientific and rational way is the prerequisite for building a modern and civil city .  Drawing on foreign experience and taking into account their local actual conditions , Tianjing , Shenyang , Benqi , Nanjing , Qingtao , Wuhan , Xian , Harbin and other cities decided the boundaries of a community in line with the geographical formation .  
In Long Yongtu 's opinion , one of Hong Kong 's major strong points is that it has a sound legal system and a population that has a good legal concept and a civil awareness of consciously knowing , understanding and abiding by the law .  
The circular called for placing the focus of safety production work on coalmines ( with chief emphasis on preventing gas and coal dust explosions ) , on the transport of fireworks and firecrackers , toxic and inflammable products , on public entertainment districts , on civil aviation , on railway , on waterways , and on highway transport .  As the 2001 New Year and the Spring Festival holidays are spaced close within each other , the spring transport task will be very arduous and passenger flow will be very heavy .  
It is up to the central agencies concerned as well as economically developed areas along the coast to step up the training of leading cadres and minority cadres in the west and the training of civil servants , specialized technical personnel , and enterprise managerial personnel .  
Railway , civil aviation , and water and highway transport departments and units must resolutely investigate and deal with instances of operating with faulty equipment and violations of rules and regulations such as overloading and excessive speed , and strictly check and prohibit passengers from carrying inflammable , combustible , or toxic and other dangerous items onto aircraft , trains , buses , and other transport means .  
and thus laid a solid foundation for raising its own overall standard and for its own development as well .  The corporation also sorted out a clear-cut train of thought for developing civil products , clearly identified goals ; and secured fresh progress in respect of pluralizing the principal body of investment for backbone civil products , separating civil products from military ones , listing civil products separately in production , and industrializing hi-tech civil products .  
It was learned that in the 10th Five-Year Plan period , apart from readjusting scientific research or production capacity for military products , the corporation is also expected to further streamline production of key military products ; preliminarily industrialize its scientific research and production capacity for hi-tech military products ; further develop civil products with active efforts in setting up separate production lines for such products , in separating civil products from military ones , and in listing civil products separately in production as well .  
The corporation will further the work of structural transformation and joint-venture or cooperative operation ; will work hard to pluralize property rights , ensure scale operation , and pluralize the principal body of investment for civil products as well ; will focus on developing civil products of high or new technology , which are usable for both military and civil purposes ;  
The appointment of Donald Tsang , who is familiar with government operations , as chief secretary for administration , and the appointment of Antony Leung , who is a member of the Executive Council and a financier , as financial secretary , however , avoided a great change in the positions of senior officials , and showed the possibility of bringing qualified people in the private sector into the civil service system , thus strengthening the government .  The appointments are laudable .  
While acting as the financial secretary , he personally understood the principle of " one country , two systems " was fully put into effect , and thus enhanced his faith in serving the SAR Government and contributing to the implementation of the principle .  On the recommendation of the chief executive , the State Council appointed Donald Tsang as chief secretary for administration to coordinate government operations and lead 180,000 civil servants .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .  Stress will be laid on preventing job related crimes in coordination with financial , securities , customs , medical and pharmaceutical , building and other trades .  
The session maintains that , in the new year , the Supreme People 's Court should , in light of the requirements set for managing the country by the law and building a socialist country ruled by the law , comprehensively strengthen all its adjudicative and executive efforts , censure all forms of crime by the law , and intensify its efforts in examining civil , commercial and administrative cases with the purpose to resolve various social problems .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .  
Its advantageous geographical location , its free port policy of complete openness , its well-developed legal system and highly efficient team of civil service , and its effective economic management and civic administration have all facilitated Hong Kong 's economic development .  
These four crucial factors which are not going to change include the legal system ; the free entrepreneurial spirit that Hong Kong upholds and a level playing field thus created ; the clean and efficient Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) civil service ; and the free flow of information .  
We have a clean and efficient civil service .  We are a practical and hard working people .  We have a solid supporting infrastructure .  Together with the fine British legacy of the common law , we are sitting on a well-cushioned platform which would carry us comfortably into the next century . "  
The spokesman also said the Government is determined to protect the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .  These include the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field , an honest , efficient and politically neutral civil service , a first class economic infrastructure and the free flow of information .  
The Homepage depicts the work and objectives of the Economic Services Bureau on the various responsibilities under its purview , including agriculture and fisheries , civil aviation , energy supplies , financial monitoring of public utilities , maritime services , meteorological services , port development , postal services , protection of endangered species , telecommunications and tourism .  
The guarantees of a high degree of autonomy contained in the Basic Law , free-market policies , prudent fiscal management , the rule of law , a level playing field , a highly-efficient civil service , and vigorous anti-corruption action were also major factors in Hong Kong 's continued success .  
Part of Hong Kong 's success is also as a result of our promotion of free competitive environment , the strict adherence to the rule of law , minimum bureaucracy and a level playing field and a strong commitment against corruption - all provided and supported by an efficient civil service .  
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
Under the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance , a person is eligible for appointment as a judge from another common law jurisdiction if he is a serving or retired judge of a court of unlimited jurisdiction in either civil or criminal matters in another common law jurisdiction , is ordinarily resident outside Hong Kong and has never been a judge of the High Court , a District Judge or a permanent magistrate in Hong Kong .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
These systems include the rule of law ; a level playing field for doing business ; a corruption-free and politically-neutral civil service ; open and transparent financial markets ; a fast and unfettered flow of information network and last but not least , a tried and tested policy of limiting Government spending to within the trend growth rate of Gross Domestic Product .  
( b ) The Civil Service Bureau co-ordinates the assessment of non-local academic qualifications for civil service appointment purposes .  Assessment is conducted on a case-by-case basis for individual civil service job applicants to determine whether the non-local qualifications held by the applicants are comparable in standard to the local qualifications required for entry to the civil service posts concerned .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
( 3 ) To streamline further the disciplinary proceedings and to remind in particular the officers at the management level to attach importance to the strict enforcement of the disciplinary actions to ensure that an effective reward and punishment system is maintained in the civil service and to prevent the reputation of the dedicated civil service from being tarnished by a few black sheep ; and  
Three categories of prospective tenants are eligible for the new scheme : Waiting List ( WL ) applicants who are due for flat allocation in the coming financial year ; Temporary Housing / Cottage Areas and squatter clearees who have satisfied prevailing PRH eligibility criteria ; and junior civil servants under the Civil Service Public Housing Quota and Estate Assistants of the Housing Department due for allocation in the coming year .  
However , as the new millennium unfolds and in order to meet the many new challenges which Hong Kong now faces , we are also making a determined effort in civil service reform .  Our objective is to make our civil service even more efficient , accountable and responsive to changing needs .  
Prior to a decision on the civil service pay adjustment , the Government ( as the management ) consults the major civil service consultative councils ; and also takes account of the net pay trend indicators , plus other factors ( such as budgetary considerations and the prevailing social and economic conditions ) . 
" The passionate , informed and civilized argument which took place over this issue only goes to show that Hong Kong remains a free and vigilant society where decisions critical to the foundations of our civil society must be debated , discussed and dissected in an open and transparent manner . 
The SCDS consulted the department management and staff before making its recommendations .  They considered that the pay advantage which the disciplined services now enjoy over the civilian grades in recognition of their special job factors should be preserved , but some adjustment would be justified to that element of the starting salaries of recruits entering the disciplined services which is based on academic qualification benchmarks in order to maintain broad comparability with the rest of the civil service .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name a few . 
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name but a few .  
Memoranda of understanding in respect of reciprocal arrangements for the service of judicial documents in civil and commercial proceedings , and in respect of the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards were signed on 14 January and 21 June this year respectively .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
( ii ) the total number of civil proceedings for damages instituted by members of the public who suffered financial losses as a result of negligence or fraudulent acts on the part of practising solicitors , and the number of cases in which the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , as well as the average amount of damages awarded ; and  
( ii ) Where disputes on proposals about significant change in conditions of service affecting a substantial part of the civil service can not be resolved , and after exhausting proper consultation and other existing administrative channels , the matter may be referred to an independent Committee of Inquiry formed under the 1968 Agreement made between the Government and the three staff associations of the Senior Civil Service Council , namely the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants ' association , the Senior Non-expatriate officers ' Association and the Association of Expatriate Civil Servants of Hong Kong .  
The Government is now reviewing the existing disciplinary mechanism for civil servants in order to enhance the effectiveness of disciplinary action against officers involved in improper practices ; and ( d ) forming jointly with ICAC a Task Force to launch in 1999 a two-year programme entitled " Civil Service Integrity Programme " to assist departments in drawing up internal guidelines on the standards of conduct expected of their staff .  
Furthermore , we must continue to move forward with free market economy with level playing field , clear , unobstrusive and transparent business regulation , a clean and effective civil service and an outward looking society .  
I confess that looking back ten years I did have some doubts as to whether it would be acceptable for the Government 's principal adviser on civil law to be neither a Chinese national , nor , I am ashamed to say , a Chinese speaker , but clearly the terms of the Basic Law which allowed for the continuing employment of British and other foreign nationals in the public service have been followed .  
The new powers under the Bill include allowing SFC to require access to the working papers of an auditor of a listed corporation in a preliminary inquiry into alleged misconduct of the corporation ; enabling SFC to impose civil fines on intermediaries as a more proportionate disciplinary sanction ; granting SFC standing to intervene in civil proceedings between third parties to protect public interest ; and allowing SFC to take custody of clients ' assets from intermediaries to prevent dissipation of such assets .  
As an alternative to the civil proceedings before the MMT , the Bill preserves and expands the existing criminal route for dealing with market misconduct activities , to be resorted to when there is sufficient evidence to meet the criminal standard and it is in the public interest to bring prosecution before the courts .  
Explaining the new civil service entry system , a Civil Service Bureau spokesman said , " We have listened to different views expressed by the Staff Sides , departmental management and members of the public during earlier consultation .  We have substantially modified the original proposals to employ all staff in basic ranks on contract terms to the current proposal . "  
To safeguard the quality of public service , the Administration has a duty to ensure that the revised benefits are more akin to private sector practice and at the same time are attractive enough to recruit and maintain officers of suitable calibre in the civil service .  
On the other hand , because of the strong growth in public sector civil engineering output , the gross value of construction work performed at public sector sites increased by 13.0% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier to $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter of 2000 .  
" We are also accountable to the Legislative Council , now fully elected , and increasingly representative under the timetable laid down in the Basic Law . The civil service has long recognised that dynamic , and willingly accepts its responsibility in explaining , defending and arguing for its policies and proposals before legislators . " 
He said : " Apart from the continued orderly implementation of the Civil Service Reform measures which have already been announced , our work in the coming year will include strengthening the integrity of civil servants , improving communication between staff and management , promoting effective and appropriate human resource management practices and fostering the public 's trust and goodwill towards the Civil Service . "  
Briefly , its Vision is to foster a dynamic , visionary and knowledge-based Civil Service , which delivers quality service to the community through a clean , trusted , respectable and fulfilled workforce ; its Mission is to develop talented civil servants , to ensure the highest standard of integrity among them , and to empower them to contribute to and take pride in their work ; and its Core Values are Simple , Positive Thinking , Fairness , Partnership and Learning .  
( a ) of its initial assessments on the recommendations made in the Review of Employees ' Compensation System in Hong Kong , published by the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers last November , in particular about adopting a step-down approach after statutory compensations have been paid to injured workers over a certain period of time , stipulating that employees are not entitled to statutory and civil compensations at the same time , and implementing a mandatory rehabilitation programme ;  
In November last year , a first group of anglophone counsel from my department attended an excellent English language course in Mainland law at Peking University . The course included lectures on the legal system and government structure in the Mainland , and on the latest developments in constitutional , criminal , civil and administrative law .  
" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
In accordance with the provisions of the pensions legislation , all retired civil servants who have been granted a pension are required to seek prior permission from the Government to take up employment , enter into business , or become partners or directors , if the principal part of the business or employment is carried on in Hong Kong , within two years after retirement , or within three years for officers retiring at Director of Bureau rank or above .  
With the arrival of the knowledged based economy , the rapid proliferation of e-learning opportunities and our firm commitment to be a world class civil service capable of providing quality service to meet the changing needs of the community , it is essential for us to continuously strengthen and modernise our approach to training and development .  
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said : " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
To minimise corruption opportunities , the Government has devised a well-balanced strategy based on sound legislation , effective administrative measures , comprehensive education programme , independent investigation and the provision of reasonable remuneration to our civil servants .  
" It is our policy that each pay adjustment exercise is a separate annual exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time . "  He stressed : " There does not exist in this year any overriding factors which justify a departure from our long-standing and well established mechanism adopted for civil service pay adjustment . "  
During its stay in the United Kingdom , France and Germany , the delegation will meet with Ministers , senior civil servants , academics and experts in constitutional law , think-tank bodies as well as non-government organizations concerned .  They will exchange views with each other on how an effective system of executive accountability would work under a unique political structure .  
In view of the background and to uphold public confidence in the integrity of the civil service disciplinary mechanism , we are prepared to disclose , on an exceptional basis , in summary the facts that have been brought forward in the disciplinary hearings whilst preserving confidentiality of individual officers involved .  
As a world-class city , Hong Kong must provide its people with a clean and comfortable living environment .  Together , we will build a civil society in which everyone can take pride , as well as enjoy a healthy and positive lifestyle in a rich cultural environment .  
As such , they are held responsible for administrative and managerial mishaps , and for personal misconduct .  They are subject to a well-established civil service appointment , management and disciplinary system .  
First and foremost , under the concept of ' One Country Two Systems ' , we have made the historic transition while preserving Hong Kong 's core values - the rule of law , a clean , accountable civil service , the free and unfettered flow of information and ideas , and a level playing field for business .  
" On the one hand , the Administration has a responsibility to ensure that civil servants receive fair and reasonable treatment without being subjected to political influence .  On the other hand , we are duty-bound to ensure that the civil service system , including the mechanism for determining and adjusting pay levels , will continue to be accepted and supported by the public , " Mr Wong said in his letter to all civil servants .  
Hong Kong 's respected legal system , its clean civil service , the free flow of information , a stable currency and a level playing field for business were recognized as important strengths that Hong Kong should protect and leverage , Mr Tsang said .  
Noting the current difficult economic situation , Mr Tung stressed that the Government would strengthen the service-oriented culture in the civil service by improving its efficiency and quality of service and fostering a higher degree of accountability and responsiveness to public aspirations .  
On the contrary , developments in both areas can go hand-in-hand .  Both areas depend on our future lawyers being adequately educated and trained ; both areas depend upon our civil justice system being cost-effective and speedy ; and both areas depend upon our ability to identify and meet the needs of those with legal problems .  
" Our respected legal system , together with our clean civil service , a free flow of information , a stable currency and a level playing field for business is recognised as important strengths that Hong Kong should protect and leverage , " he said .  
Question : Will the Government inform this Council of the current total number of staff in all public-funded organizations and statutory bodies of which the Government is the major shareholder , and the gross amounts of their monthly salary and personal emolument-related expenditure , and provide a comparison of these figures with those for the civil service ?  
Under the current arrangements , civil servants , retired civil servants in receipt of a pension or an annual allowance and their eligible dependants are entitled to medical and dental benefits provided by the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority .  
To highlight the importance which he places on the civil service and to preserve the integrity of the Accountability System , the Chief Executive has decided , after careful consideration , that the Secretary for the Civil Service should be included as a principal official under the new system and be selected from among senior civil servants .  This will ensure that the person appointed will have a full understanding and appreciation of the civil service structure and system .  
In view of the special circumstances and the fact that the person selected for the post of the Secretary for the Civil Service is a professional career civil servant , he will be allowed to return to the civil service , if his age permits , at his original rank after his appointment as the Secretary for the Civil Service . Whether or not he would do so is a matter of personal choice .  
There are increasing calls for senior civil servants to be held accountable for policy failures , including calls for some of them to step down .  However , due to the permanence of the current system and established appointment and removal systems , the current civil service system is not compatible with these demands .  
( b ) whether the movement of the price index has all along been a major consideration in determining the size of civil service pay adjustment , and whether an alternative formula has been adopted in the light of the price index falling to a negative level ; if so , of its rationale for that ?  
Mr Wong continued : " In addition , the Principal Officials will be required as a condition of their contract to uphold the principle of maintaining a permanent , political neutral , professional and honest civil service system .  
Civil servants will continue to offer advice without fear or favour , based on intellectual rigour , objective research and an inherent professional understanding of the nature of the wider public interest born of decades of experience developed in our civil service .  
From January 2003 , applicants to civil service posts at graduate or professional level will be required to obtain a pass in the two language papers ( Use of Chinese and Use of English ) in the Common Recruitment Examination Part I ( CRE ) before making application , and those to civil service posts with entry requirements set below degree level to attain at least Grade E in Chinese Language and English Language ( Syllabus B ) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination ( HKCEE ) or equivalent . 
On the basis that women 's rights are human rights , a strategic approach for advancement of women must bear in mind the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the right to development protected by the various instruments binding on the parties to the Beijing Declaration . 
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said , " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
These included the development by the Hospital Authority ( " HA " ) of a set of patient referral guidelines which would assist not only internal referrals within HA but also where appropriate , externally to the private sector ; the identification and development of shared care programmes ; the dissemination of information on private sector services through the assistance of HA ; and the possibility of developing a medical insurance scheme for new civil service recruits with the participation of the private sector , etc . 
While the system may not be perfect , it is fair to say that by and large , it has played an important role in the development of a clean , efficient , trustworthy and quality civil service in Hong Kong .  
Apart from these broader , conceptual issues , we have also taken note of the concerns expressed by the public , as reiterated by some Members today , about a growing perceived disparity in the pay levels between the civil service and the private sector as well as the inadequacy of the existing annual civil service pay adjustment mechanism to reflect the pay adjustment trends in the market .  
In deciding to offer a negative pay adjustment across the civil service this year , we have given careful consideration to all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from the 2001 / 02 Pay Trend Survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
In order to ensure that the pay adjustment decision , if approved , will be implemented with certainty , we propose to seek the enactment of a specific piece of legislation to cater for this year 's civil service pay adjustment .  The proposed legislative approach will provide for an express reduction of civil service pay by the specified percentages and provide that each officer 's contract shall be modified to the extent of the statutory variation .  
The Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr . Joseph W P Wong , today ( May 22 ) announced that the Chief Executive in Council decided to offer to the staff sides of the four central consultative councils that civil service pay be reduced by 4.42 per cent for the directorate and the upper salary band , 1.64 per cent for the middle salary band and 1.58 per cent for the lower salary band with effect from October 1 , 2002 .  
" The decision on the pay offer has been made after careful consideration of all relevant factors under the existing civil service pay adjustment mechanism , including the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale , " Mr . Wong said .  
" In the light of the prevailing economic situation , our serious budgetary position and the pay adjustment trends in the private sector , we consider that the pay offer of a negative pay adjustment in line with the net pay trend indicators is reasonable and has struck a balance between the concerns of civil servants and the interests of the community at large , " he added .  
Without attempting to repeat all the legal arguments which Law Officer ( Civil Law ) has clearly set out in his article , suffice for me to say that we have thought long and hard on this matter and have come to the conclusion that legislation is the only viable means to implement with certainty a justified decision of a modest pay reduction made strictly in accordance with the established mechanism for civil service pay adjustment . 
In my earlier letter of April 17 , 2002 , I have highlighted that the Chief Executive had , when addressing the Legislative Council on April 17 , 2002 , emphasised the importance of maintaining , under the Accountability System , a permanent , meritocratic , professional , politically neutral and honest civil service .  
As the top echelon of the Government , the new principal officials are expected to lead and contribute towards the building up of an efficient , professional , fair , clean and honest civil service .  
* provisions which stress that civil servants will continue to be appointed , managed and promoted in accordance with the prevailing rules applicable to the civil service ; and be subject to the prevailing disciplinary mechanism , under which allegations of misconduct are determined through an impartial process based on consideration of factual evidence ; 
In parallel , we shall issue a composite Civil Service Circular to ensure that all colleagues in the civil service clearly understand their role and responsibilities in relation to the new principal officials .  This circular will set out the framework within which civil servants are to work to the principal officials .  In particular , it will enunciate the core values and high standard of probity that civil servants are expected to uphold in discharging their official duties , including the following :  
Otherwise , the public at large would criticize the Government for failing its responsibility .  It would be detrimental to the overall interests of the civil service and the community if our failure to implement the pay reduction led to the impression that civil servants were unwilling to share the burden with the rest of the community in time of difficulty or our inaction meant that our severe fiscal deficit could not be alleviated .  
" Moreover , Hong Kong offers the conducive business environment and facilities to facilitate the development of the shipping industry .  These include a low tax regime , efficient banking services , excellent communications , modern infrastructures , a sound legal system , business-friendly policies , a clean and accountable civil service as well as a highly educated and skilled workforce , " she said .  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .  
Some of the considerations under the existing mechanism such as the net pay trend indicators and the cost of living are capable of upward and downward movements .  It is thus inherent in our annual pay adjustment policy and mechanism that civil service pay may be increased or decreased .  
In response to the suggestion of the Staff Side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time .

In response to the suggestion of the staff side of SCSC that the Government should restore an alleged " shortfall " in pay adjustment which has accumulated since 1989 , the Chief Executive is also of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that each civil service pay adjustment exercise is taken as a separate and independent exercise based on circumstances prevailing at the time .  
The civil service will continue to be subject to the prevailing civil service disciplinary system , under which allegations of misconduct against individual civil servants are determined through an impartial process based on consideration of factual evidence .  
Miss Willis said Hong Kong has remained true to its foundations of success : the rule of law underpinned by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for business ; free flow of information ; a society which respects human rights and a clean , efficient and effective civil service despite the challenges faced in the past five years .  
( ii ) the principal official will be entitled to a fixed monthly salary , provident fund contribution by the Government , paid vacation leave of 22 working days per annum , and the same medical and dental benefits and treatment available to civil servants but not any pension or end of contract gratuity payment ;  
The much cherished civil service , which was permanent , stable , meritocratic , professional , clean and politically neutral , would be maintained .  
This was mainly attributable to intensified works on some major private residential and commercial building projects , more than offsetting the scale-back in the Public Housing Programme and the tapering work on some public civil engineering projects .  
Back in 1996 , the Working Group on Occupational Safety and Health in the Civil Service was set up by the Civil Service Bureau , comprising members from the four central consultative councils , with the objective of motivating joint efforts of the management and staff sides to inculcate an occupational safety and health ( OSH ) culture in the civil service and enhance civil servants ' awareness of the subject through various educational and publicity programmes .  
As regards operating expenditure , if the additional or improved services as planned , the natural increases in such expenditure as on pension , and the fact that the civil service pay can not be adjusted by the original assumed percentage , are taken into account , the total of operating expenditure to be incurred in 2003-04 will exceed the amount estimated in the Medium Range Forecast . 
The Task Force set up under the three advisory bodies has recently completed the Phase One study , which is an analytical study on recent developments in civil service pay administration in other Governments . In its Phase One Final Report , the Task Force has made recommendations on priority areas for more detailed study in the short , medium and long terms . 
If you look back objectively and separate out the expected opposing and strident statements by the staff unions , you will discover , by and large , that civil servants have handled all these challenges remarkably well .  They have quietly but surely demonstrated a genuine desire and commitment to serve the community to the best of their abilities and within the available resources .  
We still have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community .  
Besides , the Chief Executive also acknowledged that the civil service had made remarkable contributions in achieving a savings of $ 6 billion and a 10 per cent reduction in civil service establishment while assuring the quality of public services in increasing productivity under the Enhanced Productivity Programme .  
We are committed to maintaining a small but responsive and accountable government , and a permanent , meritocratic , professional , politically neutral and clean civil service . "  
Having considered relevant evidence , we have initiated disciplinary actions against the civil servants who had been negligent in carrying out their duties in accordance with the established civil service disciplinary mechanism .  We are liaising closely with the Civil Service Bureau to ensure prompt completion of all outstanding cases .  
Quoting the findings of a professional and comprehensive public opinion poll commissioned by Civil Service Bureau in October 2002 , she said : " Over 70 per cent of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80 per cent considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
According to a professional and comprehensive opinion poll we commissioned last October , over 70% of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80% considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
The improved mechanism would comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments .  
" We shall in consultation with staff develop , on the basis of the existing mechanism , an improved civil service pay adjustment which should comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments , " Mr Wong said . 
To secure public acceptance of the results of the pay level survey and the new pay adjustment mechanism , I shall set up a steering committee , comprising members from outside the civil service , to provide independent and impartial advice on the conduct of the pay level survey and other matters related to the development of the improved pay adjustment mechanism .  The steering committee will commence work next month .  
" If any civil servant is found to have provided false information or abused this special measure , the exceptional approval on sick leave granted to him will be withdrawn and the period of absence will be counted against his earned leave account .  
" To set an example of a good employer , the government has arranged that any civil servant whose household member is a confirmed atypical pneumonia case may be granted paid sick leave . "  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
The improved mechanism will comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
Should the ISSOs be the subject matter of legal proceedings decisive of an individual 's civil rights and obligations or criminal liability , the content of the relevant Orders will be the subject of argument and interpretation in a public hearing and published in a judgment made public , as required by Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill or Rights Ordinance , Cap . 383 which implements Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
( c ) Apart from the activities mentioned above , the Government , as the largest employer in Hong Kong , has always strived to provide a good working environment and challenging jobs with a view to attracting suitable Hong Kong talents overseas who meet the respective qualification requirements to join the Hong Kong civil service so as to build up a dynamic , visionary and knowledge-based civil service .  
We have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a very cosmopolitan community .  
We have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low tax , a large pool of talent and a very cosmopolitan community .  
* The SCCLR seeks further views from the public on whether statutory backing should be given to the Listing Rules together with tougher statutory sanctions including civil fines against non-compliance and whether the regulation of unlisted companies needs to be improved and if so , how should this be addressed in terms of institutional change . 
We have the hardware and the software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community . 
He said : " The figure shows that disciplined grade staff who have joined the civil service on or after June 1 , 2000 have progressively been transferred to permanent terms upon the completion of a three-year probationary period provided they could achieve continued satisfactory conduct and efficient performance of work and maintain continued physical fitness .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , accompanied by the Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , met representatives from major civil service unions and departmental consultative committees today ( September 24 ) .  During the meeting , Mr Tung said that he had always regarded civil servants as the most important asset of the Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) Government , and took pride in being surrounded by a world-class team of professional and efficient civil servants .  
If all goes well with the experiment , the lay assessor 's court can be fully effected without serious problem . ( 2 ) It was also decided the types of written court verdicts should be simplified , and that besides looking into such simplification during amendment of the civil and criminal laws , the Compulsory Execution Law could be amended to give executing authorities the right to consult tax records to avoid hiding of property or false claims of debt .  
After the lifting of martial law , civil servants suffered blows mainly from two sides . One was policy instability caused by too rapid change and a lack of clarity in the laws . Another side rose out of the " psychological lifting of martial law , " raising consciousness of popular rights and leading to demands reasonable and unreasonable upon the government .  
But a couple of years ago such was private sector demand for experienced and well qualified personnel in the securities , banking and broadcasting industries that suitable civil servants became avidly sought after , while relatively low pay and an inflexible advancement system also contributed to the civil service brain drain .  
" The real issue is whether agency heads have the determination and guts to exercise their assessment responsibilities , " points out Hsu Yu-fu . The basic status of civil servants is guaranteed by law and they can not be cashiered lightly ; meanwhile those dismissed with a " D " grading will lose their pension entitlement , so departmental heads shrink from drastic action from sympathetic considerations and to avoid a backlash , which , means there is no effective way of weeding out unsuitable personnel . "  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
The pay for a general civil servant is divided into " base salary " and " supplementary salary . " It differs according to rating and position . Ratings , from low to high , go from designated rank to recommended rank to selected rank , with the lowest being designated rank-1 and the highest selected rank-14 ( equivalent to an office director ) .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep . It will take time and a good civil service system to build up the concept and image of administrative neutrality .  
Their businesslike atmosphere may be less entertaining for many than the witty and aggressive question time in the Chamber , yet televising has certainly contributed to a greater public awareness of their work as well as forcing ministers and civil servants to take them more seriously . As for the problem of disorderly behavior among MPs , the presence of the cameras does seem to have actually improved their conduct .  
For example , one of the most successful items in this year 's old people 's consumer exhibition by the social affairs department was undoubtedly the " old people 's manpower bank " organized by the Women 's Outreach Center . Over 300 people signed up on the spot , and in due course another 50 be came official members , including retired military officers , retired doctors , teachers , banking personnel and civil servants .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
Explaining these four aims , Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou says that making people afraid to be corrupt takes strict laws ; making them unable to be corrupt takes comprehensive preventive measures ; the way to make them unwilling to be corrupt is to instil in public servants a sense of honor in uprightness and shame in corruption ; and for civil servants to have no need to be corrupt depends on giving then adequate salaries , so that they can afford to stay clean , and do not need to rely on ill-gotten gains .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
This is still far removed from Chen Tingnan 's ideal for a " county cabinet , " in which all top administrators come and go with the executive , need not be approved by the provincial government , and are not bound by the civil service regulations on qualifications but are seen as political appointees . But at least it 's some improvement .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
But after war broke out between China and Japan , the mainland market gradually declined , and then as war spread throughout East Asia , shipping became difficult and many rushwork traders went out of business . After the war ended , things looked up economically , but then mainland China fell victim to civil war , which continued until the Nationalist government withdrew to Taiwan , and the state of the rushwork trade went from bad to worse .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Knowledge vs . philosophy of lifeThe classics were attacked as part of the old civil service exams , but the exams , which were graded irrespective of social rank and made it possible for men of common background to serve the nation , were bad only for having set questions and standards for grading . Particularly near the end , people were selected based on how they wrote " the eight-legged essay , " which imposed great restrictions on form and wiped out originality of thought .  
" Many educated Taiwanese back then grieved over the island being severed from China , " Liao Yi-chin says . " With the civil service examination system discarded , the literati realized that what they had studied would no longer be of any practical use , and so they consigned their literary talents to verse . " The formerly renowned Chestnut Leaved Oak Poetry Society of Taichung takes its name from the tree described in Zhuangzi that survived because of its uselessness .  
Meanwhile the domestic tenders , which were intended to support the ROC 's own civil engineering sector , also provoked a fierce conflict between the forces of the big established operators and those of new players , and suspicions of collusion or excessive price cutting in their tenders have not been laid to rest to this day .  
This was the most bothersome problem for Kuo Mei-fang . " I was sure the clock tower could be made to be very precise , but only if it was built by very skilled craftsmen . This might have been possible for an ancient emperor to arrange , but for me as a lowly civil servant it was a tall order . "  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
In 1994 Wealth reported that the lawyer Chiu Chang , who was scurrying back and forth across the Taiwan Strait , really did n't have much professional knowledge about mainland policy and that she was prone to making exaggerated , sensationalistic statements . Chiu Chang filed a lawsuit against all 20 people on the magazine 's masthead , and because the magazine is also distributed in America , filed a civil suit in US courts as well .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
The gray roof tiles of the charming houses surrounded by mango trees make a quaint picture . The majority of residents in Chunghsing Village , the seat of the provincial government since its relocation in 1955 , consist of employees of the provincial government . The community benefits from excellent planning and facilities , and many civil servants here have enjoyed decades graced by the simple community lifestyle .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
People have long criticized Chinese society for putting more emphasis on human relationships than on written codes . But many people do not know that during the Han dynasty , China had a comprehensive set of laws that was every bit as impressive as the renowned imperial Roman civil code .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
Liu Chia-lang , head of the office of civil affairs , also has strong feelings on the future of development and industry in Tungkang : " Only Japan and Tungkang produce banded coral shrimp , which is one of the main seafood products of the town . And Tapeng Bay abounds in natural resources . Tungkang has what it takes to develop . But Taiwan 's entry into the WTO is going to be a heavy blow to Tungkang 's fishing industry . "  
With the ensuing civil war , Yu and his family moved to Taiwan , a country in extreme poverty and still relatively unenlightened . Yu decided to play out his role as intellectual and social critic through establishing a newspaper .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
Examination Yuan vice president nominee Chang stated that if endorsed she would assist in civil service system reform by advocating professional and effective management of government agencies . In the future , public officials would need to be certified , and those that failed to meet the new criteria would be phased out .

Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams . The main path for the children of working class families was to finish primary school and get a job in a factory . Even for those with higher education , the value of security-the " iron rice bowl " - was paramount , and becoming a civil servant was considered the best guarantee for the future .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
Weng Ya-lan , a graduate of National Taipei Teachers ' College , says that this is the third year she has been sitting exams . She had been working all along as a substitute teacher in Taipei County . If not successful this time , she had planned to study for the junior and senior civil service exams and become a civil servant .  
Before starting to paint , face painters first take a red cloth to hold down the actor 's hair while exposing the face . Then they dab their fingers with red or black pigment and outline the shape of the character 's eyes . Next , they begin to paint the base . For instance , the civil and martial mandarins and Generals Liu and Xie have white pigment applied first , whereas the two sides of General Gan 's face are painted separately red and black , and General Fan 's face is painted inky black .

An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .

Since before the 1980s , Central America had begun to suffer the effects of a deep political , economic and social crisis that came about precisely because national societies had developed within a system of limited democracy in particular , because social programmes were not formulated or executed , a doctrine of national security was promoted , political arenas were closed and civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights were violated in one way or another .

High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .

This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .

Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children .

It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
As I have said on other occasions , this state of affairs is aggravated by armed conflicts , civil wars , the AIDS pandemic added to other devastating or debilitating endemic illnesses , such as malaria and by emergency situations , such as famine , drought , natural disasters , desertification and so on .

In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious inter-community relations , mutual tolerance and respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted at youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women .  
Poverty has various manifestations ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion ; it is also characterized by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil and socio-cultural life . 
Appeals to Governments to empower rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and to actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
The full and equal , participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .

She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .

My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Desiring , in the interests of their citizens , to ensure equal conditions for their residence in the territories of the two Parties and , in this connection , wishing to offer the citizens of one Party who reside permanently in the territory of the other Party a legal status that is as close as possible to the legal status of the citizens of the other Party , in particular as regards civil , political , social , economic , labour , cultural and other rights ,  
It identified five areas upon which efforts should be concentrated : economic restructuring that empowered women , creating sustainable livelihoods , building stable lives and healthy communities , peace building and conflict resolution , and ethical governance and respect for civil society .  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
As a result of this cooperation , which has a broad base in civil society and non-governmental organizations involved in improving the status of women , the preparatory documents for the Beijing Conference have been prepared and a system developed to establish a national capacity for putting the strategy into operation .  
The prolonged global economic recession , combined with the debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes , civil strife and displacement and environmental degradation have undermined the capacity of Governments to meet the basic needs of their populations .  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .  
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .  
Reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence , territorial integrity , national unity and for liberation from colonial and foreign domination , and for the establishment of a society in which people , irrespective of race , colour or creed , will fully enjoy economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights on a basis of equality and participate freely in the determination of their destiny ,  
The cost estimate also makes provision for pending claims by civilian and military personnel for lost personal effects as a result of the civil war ( $ 500,000 ) , of which an amount of $ 375,000 has been brought forward from the previous mandate period .  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,

Much of its work has focused on establishing the necessary international legal and policy framework for ensuring women 's full and equal enjoyment of their rights in the political , economic , civil , social and educational fields .  
Within his mandate to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by women of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights attaches special importance to the promotion of the equal status and human rights of women .  
A number of countries report that they have further reinforced the constitutional guarantees by enacting separate equality laws or amending civil , penal and family codes to ensure that women are accorded equal rights , protection , equal access and opportunities in education , employment , health and matrimonial and family matters under statutory laws .  
In many countries , the values of society are still strongly influenced by customary or religious practices and regulations that are sometimes in direct conflict with international human rights standards , as well as with national statutory laws where civil law differs from the customary or religious practices .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
It contains a menu of action-oriented recommendations directed towards civil society , labour , business , local governmental authorities , national Governments and international organizations .

The reports identify five major causes of increasing urbanization , all of which are about the search for better living conditions : rural unemployment and underemployment ; poor rural social services ; lack of arable land ; natural disasters , particularly drought ; and civil unrest .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] : [ - The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women ;  
Strongly appeals to all women , in particular rural women , to be aware of and develop their potential and actively engage , individually or in groups , in the fight for the enforcement of their rights , the improvement of their civil , personal and professional status , and the increasing of their representation in sufficient number in all policy-making , decision-making and consultative bodies and functions ;  
In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to support the mechanisms for operational coordination and inter-agency programming through IASC , other forums and the United Nations resident coordinators in the field in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent response to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of persons suffering from famine or displaced by civil strife or other disorders .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .

States Parties thus agree to initiate constitutional , legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure equality both generally and within specific contexts , including political and public life , nationality , education , work , health , legal and civil matters and the family .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
It stems from the fact that staff members of the United Nations and the common system are governed by comprehensive rules and regulations , as well as General Assembly resolutions , and principles applicable to international civil servants which are quite dissimilar from the typical labour-union collective-bargaining agreement provisions which professional arbitrators are usually called upon to interpret and apply .  
Countries may experience disruption of their governmental systems from at least three major sources : massive natural disasters , such as earthquakes , cyclones , or volcanic eruptions ; internal civil strife ; or external conflict / war with neighbouring States .  
After nearly three years of civil strife , marked by increasing violence , corruption , and near-total devastation of the country 's social and economic infrastructure , the military general , Raoul Cedras , under strong threat of outside military intervention sanctioned by the United Nations , returned the legitimate authority of the Government of Haiti peacefully to its democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide .  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory .

We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
They are , inter alia , rights to equality of treatment and non-discrimination ; such cultural rights as the right to use indigenous languages , to use indigenous dress and to practise indigenous forms of spirituality ; such civil and political rights as the rights to practise traditional indigenous forms of social organization ; and such economic and social rights as the right to hold land under traditional forms of tenure .  
Political will , a flexible and gradual approach , a favourable economic environment , the involvement of the private sector and relevant sectors of civil society , appropriate institutional and physical infrastructure as well as creative networking were among the factors contributing to such success .  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) , adopted by the General Assembly in 1989 and since ratified by 177 States , is an international instrument that promotes and protects the human rights of children in different areas ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ) .  
On many occasions in the past we have declared that the practice of waging indiscriminate attacks against a defenceless civilian population is a particularly heinous practice that is totally unacceptable under every standard of civil society .  
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
The Platform for Action reaffirms that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights .

Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
To this end , Governments , the international community and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern [ with full respect for religious and ethical values , cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms ] :  
The rising toll of violence linked to civil strife , terrorism and ordinary street crime , and the price exacted by organized , economic and environmental criminality , have jeopardized some of the gains of development and undermined future prospects .

Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
Therefore , there must be a workable legal framework consistent with modern labour management practices that guarantees to all civil servants due process and equal protection equivalent to the rights and principles they would enjoy under relevant national laws .

Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
to observe basic civil rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression , as had been the case in Nigeria recently with the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other prominent human rights activists , destroyed confidence in the judiciary , frightened people and impeded their empowerment .  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
Further evidence of this is the dangerous , irresponsible , uncontrolled and unregulated intrusion of this organization 's aircraft , for purposes other than providing air service , into a zone of significant international civil aviation activity and one of the most active international air corridors of the western hemisphere .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
The civil service is trying to provide specific answers to this popular concern through transparent processes that are available to ordinary citizens , who in this way can find out not only how , why and for what purpose a particular civil servant was hired , but also how much this costs the State and , above all , what that person 's actual contribution is in measurable terms of quantity , quality and cost-effectiveness .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
The immediate consequences of this were the destruction of approximately one seventh of the population , the majority of whom were in the productive labour force ; the destruction of infrastructure and equipment , both public and private ; the collapse of institutions , including the civil service , judiciary and local administration , to mention but a few ; a severe setback in economic activity , particularly agriculture and industrial activities ; the exodus of between 1-million and 2-million people to neighbouring countries as refugees ;  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
They have been declared entirely subordinate to the political Constitution as an apolitical , non-partisan , non-deliberative body obedient to civil authority ; mandatory military service has also been abolished .  
Thus , seven preparatory studies have been undertaken in fields as diverse and important as the following : first , remuneration in the civil service ; second ; summary of audits conducted in certain Ministries ; third , rapid diagnostic assessments of Ministries that have not been audited ; fourth , administrative practices and the State of law ; fifth , analysis of the general status of the civil service ; sixth , inquiry into the image of the public sector ; and , seventh , ethics , professional conduct and motivation of State employees .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
They are also aimed at creating a lean , efficient , highly motivated and dutiful civil service , based on the job requirements and carefully evaluated professional requirements of each Ministry and public institution .  
Neither its drafting nor its content is commensurate with the gravity of the Israeli aggression and its serious consequences for the people of Lebanon , who have been subjected to killing and displacement , let alone with the destructive negative implications for Lebanon 's infrastructure and for its Government 's tenacious reconstruction efforts and ambitious reconstruction plans after long years of a destructive civil war .  
The negative consequences of such a threat could lead to greater destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure and reverse the efforts of its Government and people to rebuild all that was destroyed in the civil war , which was a terrible burden on the Lebanese people , who faced the horrors of destruction throughout an extremely difficult and confused period of Lebanon 's modern history . 
The Committee strongly recommends that urgent special temporary measures be adopted , under article 4 of the Convention , with the aim of substantially increasing the presence of women in all areas of public and political life , as well as actively promoting their position in the senior management of the civil service and in the diplomatic service .  
This year 's international conferences HABITAT II , the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have marked the completion of a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored conferences which covered the full range of civil , political , economic and social issues that affect the peoples of the world .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
For their part , African people and their leaders need to continue to apply themselves to the immense task of bettering their prospects of recovery through ongoing programmes of political and economic reform , releasing the energies both physical and intellectual of the citizenry through the protection and promotion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights , and through the empowerment of women and youth , who are the underutilized agents of economic endeavour .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
For decades , Central America has experienced repeated conflict and violence and has been afflicted by civil war and confrontation that left a well-known aftermath of social injustice , institutional fragility and economic disruption .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
It also recognizes the following essential bases for social development : democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , responsible governance and the participation of civil society , as well as peace , freedom , stability and national and international security .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;

Organizations of civil society have been praised for being flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at the grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society .

However , through our civil military cooperation ( CIMIC ) operations IFOR has established an effective mechanism to coordinate activities with the many international non-governmental and other civilian organizations contributing to the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
It was also essential to create conditions for the reconstruction of civil society , particularly for the holding of free and fair elections and for building democratic institutions which would guarantee the rule of law and foster deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
In that connection , it should be underlined that the protection and international promotion of human rights would be effective only if they were based on the principle of the indivisibility and equal value of all human rights ( civil , cultural , economic , political and social ) .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
India was encouraged that the international community had adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which underlined the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights , civil , political , economic , social and cultural , identified new forms of intolerance and violence and defined particularly vulnerable groups ( children and minorities ) who deserved special consideration .  
While the administrative restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights fell within the scope of the Fifth Committee , it was the task of the Third Committee to study the restructuring of policy , ensuring that emphasis was placed on economic , social and cultural rights , which were being neglected because priority was still being accorded to civil and political rights .  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
In the specific area of the advancement of women , the emphasis would be placed on reinforcing women 's economic power , power-sharing between men and women , improving access to social services , raising their legal status through reform of the civil codes , reinforcing their role in the culture of peace , supporting women in particularly difficult circumstances and promoting and protecting the girl child .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large .

Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
Establish and implement consultative mechanisms among the governmental authorities that are responsible for economic , environmental , social , human settlements and shelter policies , and the organization of civil society and the private sector so as to coordinate the shelter sector in a coherent manner , which should include identifying the market and precise criteria for allocations , subsidies and other forms of assistance ;  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .

Convinced that each woman , man and child , to realize their full human potential , must be made aware of all their human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social ,  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .

Cuba has not violated the existing international ethical norms on the use of weapons against civil aircraft , nor has it violated any international legal norm or precept related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation , or the Chicago Convention , much less article 3 bis of the 1984 Montreal Protocol , for very concrete and evident reasons :  
Recalling further that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,

The cease-fire broke down on 29 April when an attempted meeting of the Council of State , attended by Chairman Sankawulo together with Councilmen Taylor and Kromah , was cut short after fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and NPFL / ULIMO-K forces near the executive mansion .  NULLThe fighting rapidly escalated overnight into some of the worst fighting witnessed since the start of the civil war in December 1989 .  
These violations are an irrefutable proof of the deliberate abuse , by a terrorist organization , of the rules of international civil aviation , whose harmonic development , compatible with the sovereignty and relations of respect and cooperation of sovereign States , is one of the principal objectives of the existence and the work of the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) . 
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .

Undertake a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative which includes : ( i ) suspending the excessive granting to individuals of licences to carry firearms while measures aimed at severely restricting such activity are being enacted ; ( ii ) stepping up the efforts to impede the illegal flow of arms across the borders ; and ( iii ) issuing strict instructions to monitor the weapons of disbanded and inactive voluntary civil defence committees so as to prevent their transfer to similar organizations ;  
Adopt measures , prior to the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace , and without detriment to the legal dissolution of the voluntary civil defence committees , to eradicate and put a stop to the establishment of organizations of varying names and origins , including some of those established to replace disbanded voluntary civil defence committees , which carry out State functions , such as security or public order , outside the institutional framework of the State .  
When confronted with the task of placing the importance of the two questions in proper perspective , it is obvious to us that human life is the supreme value which we must protect , just as we must protect the security of civil aviation in this case , by defending and reiterating the applicable norms of international law .

In order to make youth aware of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as their societal responsibilities , and in order to develop harmonious intercommunity relations , mutual tolerance , mutual respect , equality between women and men , and tolerance for diversity , [ in the framework of their beliefs ] * Governments should develop human rights education strategies targeted to youth , taking particular account of the human rights of women and the girl child . 
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .

The Government 's development efforts in the last three months have centred on encouraging passage by Parliament of two key laws related to the structural adjustment programme - civil service reform and modernization of public enterprises , maintaining the macroeconomic balance necessary to attract private investment and reactivating externally financed public investment to improve the country 's infrastructure and provide a much-needed stimulus to domestic demand .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
Periodic natural and man-made disasters and other adverse situations , including political instability and civil strife and problems of refugees and their attendant negative consequences , continue to imperil the fragile socio-economic conditions in many least developed countries .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Organizations of civil society are often flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
Thus , for example , Tunisian women have been encouraged to set up production enterprises in various sectors and have benefited from numerous opportunities giving them access to the highest responsibilities in administrative and decision-making circles , opening up the way for their participation in all consultative bodies dealing with national affairs and the people 's future , and to the fulfilment of their role in a civil society whose basis is the elimination of all forms of direct or indirect exclusion .

The practice of voluntary military recruitment shall be continued , until the Government of Guatemala , on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights , adopts the necessary administrative decisions , and the Guatemalan Congress approves a civil service law , which shall include military service and community service ; this law shall entail fulfilment of a duty and a constitutional right , which is neither compulsory nor a violation of human rights , is universal and non-discriminatory , and would reduce the length of service and offer options to citizens .  
The overall objective , strengthening civil society , is pursued on a country-by-country , regional , interregional and global basis , through the provision of assistance to national non-governmental organizations in the form of training courses on human rights , fellowships and support of appropriate projects developed by them .  
It offers constitutional and legislative assistance ; human rights support to parliaments ; human rights training for United Nations peacekeepers ; assistance in strengthening the administration of justice ( including human rights training for the legal profession , police and prison officials ) ; assistance for the establishment of independent , effective national human rights institutions ; assistance for the conduct of free and fair elections ; and support to non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
The right to development is related to all human rights but can not be identified with the sum of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights or be confused with development itself .  
Key concerns addressed in the process - as discussed in detail in the first report - are political legitimacy , accountability and transparency ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; bureaucratic accountability ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .

The main reason for the unregulated status of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents of Latvia and Estonia of non-Latvian and non-Estonian origin is the legislation of those countries on the basis of which those persons have arbitrarily been deprived of their citizenship and have been declared to be aliens in their own countries of residence whose fundamental political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights are thus being curtailed .  
The task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
Although significant progress had been made in the field of human rights , particularly in the eradication of apartheid and the adoption of conventions protecting the human rights of women and children , the enjoyment of political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights was far from being universal , and it was regrettable that the end of the cold war had not brought about an improvement in the situation .

This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .

Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented with measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly : a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .

It recognized that the Declaration on the Right to Development constituted an integral link between the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action through its elaboration of a holistic vision integrating economic , social and cultural rights with civil and political rights .  
In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May .

Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
States should enact or strengthen anti-discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , that will ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Despite the insecurity and precarious balance of terror that have marked three years of civil war in Burundi , it still has an organized Government that is capable of acting , unlike other countries torn apart by internal conflicts .  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
The same individuals stated that this policy based on religion and its manifestations , particularly in the economic and social fields , had recently become less violent but was still being pursued by indirect means , such as the continuing presence of Indian security forces at the Golden Temple and the measures taken with regard to the civil service ( see para . 79 below ) .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Recalling also that , in order to promote development , equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Noting that the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has highlighted the imbalance in the special rapporteur system by referring to the fact that although there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the recognized interdependence , indivisibility and interrelationship of the two sets of rights ,  
Guideline 5 : States should enact or strengthen anti _ discrimination and other protective laws that protect vulnerable groups , people living with HIV / AIDS and people with disabilities from discrimination in both the public and private sectors , ensure privacy and confidentiality and ethics in research involving human subjects , emphasize education and conciliation , and provide for speedy and effective administrative and civil remedies .  
Concerned that the international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected and that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ,  
Reiterates the unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
This article _ which the bulk of legal doctrine considers as jus cogens _ requires the observance of judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples during a civil war and , in the light of case law arising from international conflicts , should apply all the more so when the threat to the life of the nation is less serious .  
To achieve this end , most dictatorial governments have resorted to pseudo _ consultations of the people , in the form of plebiscites or referendums , generally against a background of severe restrictions on the exercise of civil and political rights and public freedoms , as was the case in the Philippines under the Government of President Marcos in 1973 and again in 1979 , in Chile under Pinochet and in Uruguay , where it was attempted unsuccessfully on the occasion of the 1980 constitutional referendum . 
After welcoming the preliminary report on the impunity of perpetrators of human rights violations ( economic , social and cultural rights ) ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1994 / 11 and Corr . 1 ) , the Sub _ Commission decided ( resolution 1994 / 34 ) to split the study in two , entrusting Mr . Joinet with the aspect of civil and political rights and Mr . El Hadji Guiss with that of economic , social and cultural rights .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Basic surveys and studies for administrative reform were continued , and action on a number of issues is under active consideration , including the establishment of unified salary scales for the public service and restructuring of the civil service with employment based on qualifications and equal opportunity .  
The need for such volunteer effort is greater today than ever , given the adverse impact of global problems such as environmental degradation , drug abuse or HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of society , given the concern of the international community for the eradication of poverty and given the contemporary trend for civil society , in partnership with Governments and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Convinced that the need for volunteer effort is greater than ever , in light of the adverse impact of such global problems as environmental degradation , poverty , drug abuse and HIV / AIDS on the more vulnerable sectors of societies , and of the trend for civil society , in partnership with government and the private sector , to assume ever greater responsibilities in the development process ,  
Take note of the Preliminary Agreement on a National Reconciliation Pact , which is the outcome of a broad consultation of those representing the vital forces of the Central African nation , thereby embodying the solemn commitment of the political parties , the trade union federations and the civil society to respect the constitutional legal order and to lend full support to all initiatives to promote dialogue and national reconciliation ;  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
The right to development was one of the most important human rights , transcending both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights and standing at the nexus formed by democracy , development and respect for human rights .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism regardless of their motivation , in all its forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts of aggression aimed at the annihilation of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening territorial integrity and international peace and security , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of States ;

Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Expressing its serious concern that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights , in particular those of vulnerable groups in society , continue to be violated in many parts of the world and that millions of people still suffer misery , live in poverty and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ,  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
The effort of the international community should be aimed at encouraging the emergence of pluralist political forces supported by a civil society that is aware of its basic rights and on a private sector that is both dynamic and entrepreneurial .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Since my previous report on questions relating to information ( A / 51 / 406 ) , the Department of Public Information has continued to enhance its outreach efforts by strengthening its partnerships with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , among others , and by utilizing information technology to its fullest capacity , while continuing to make gains in outreach through the traditional media : press , radio and television .  
The main objectives of the Institute are : to raise public awareness for human rights ; to further educate civil servants , teachers , lawyers on human rights ; to strengthen human rights education in the Cyprus educational system at all levels ; to strengthen the capacity of the mass media for human rights education by appropriate means ; to promote the active engagement of national non-governmental organizations in the realization of the goals of the Decade ; and to establish a human rights library in order to enhance public awareness .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
This ongoing process is guided by and based on respect for human rights , transparent , representative and accountable governance , the rule of law and civil peace .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The quantitative efforts set out above should be complemented by measures to improve the qualitative aspects of international development cooperation , particularly a better focus on its distribution ; greater national capacities to coordinate national and international resources ; improved national ownership of externally financed programmes ; international cooperation based on national priorities , involving other development partners , including civil society ; and strengthened national capacities to plan for , manage , monitor and evaluate the impact of development cooperation .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
It was stated that numerous human rights violations stemmed from the absence of a functioning State system , including social development programmes and a national treasury to pay the salaries of civil servants .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
As a pioneering effort in the region , the Team has demonstrated extraordinary merit and extensive reach of influence and effects throughout the region , inspiring replication of approach and encouraging a broad sector of combined government and civil society participation . 
The Team has directly raised awareness about Pacific island Constitutions , laws , human rights , gender and the application of United Nations Conventions among rural and urban women , youth groups , civil society activists , social welfare officers , police officers , religious seminarians , magistrates , justices , senior court judges and other providers of the justice system in the Cook Islands , Fiji , the Federated States of Micronesia , Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Nauru , Niue , Samoa , the Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
In general , it planned to focus on strategic policy formulation and the broad issues facing the common system , with a view to shaping the international civil service of the future .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Though the end of the cold war has greatly reduced the threat of another global war , which twice in this century brought untold sorrow to mankind , intra-country conflicts and civil wars continue to wreak havoc in several countries , with resultant loss of lives , destruction of national infrastructure , displacement of innocent persons and outflow of refugees into neighbouring countries .  
After nearly eight years of fratricidal civil war and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) Monitoring Group ( ECOMOG ) intervention in Liberia , countries of the subregion , with only the limited assistance of the international community , finally succeeded in supervising the conduct of presidential and legislative elections in the country in July 1997 , under conditions generally acknowledged to be free and fair .  
The Ecuadorian State is committed to following this line of conduct and to promoting and protecting all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , including the right to development .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
We are confident that his long experience as an international civil servant and his correct assessment and proper action in implementing the United Nations reform are guarantees of the successful crowning of our efforts to have a stronger and more efficient Organization .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
As a State that has experienced first-hand all the hardships of civil war and has travelled the difficult road towards national reconciliation with active support and assistance from the United Nations , Tajikistan is convinced of the need to preserve strong and efficient peacemaking mechanisms .  
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
And yet in my country , which today is in the grip of civil war , almost everything has been done since the sovereign national conference to spare our young democracy from the tragic upheavals inherent in any sudden social change , which in this case consisted of the move from a single-party political regime banning any organized opposition to a veritable explosion of freedoms individual , political and religious .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
The collective campaign of the world community to define , promote and protect human rights across the globe represents a great achievement of humanity at large and needs to be cherished by all ; however , the imperative of a balanced approach to all aspects of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , should not be theoretically underestimated or practically neglected .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
A well-educated civil service , with high professional standards and resistant to pressure from privileged groups relating to distributional issues , can also be a significant force for stable and sustainable economic policies .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
To ensure broad-based support for drug control objectives , UNDCP has sought to involve civil society and foster awareness of the adverse political , economic and social impact of illicit drug trafficking and abuse .

The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
Optimism , combined with an awareness of the enormous task ahead , will be necessary in creating an environment in which the people of Guatemala are able , among other things , to exercise their legitimate civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We reaffirm that all human rights - civil , cultural , economic , political and social - are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .  
Recognizing the catastrophic consequences of the civil war in Croatia , resolved to put an end to this situation and influence the remedying of the consequences and the building of new democratic and humane relations , the international community has prevailed upon the two warring parties to sign the Basic ( Erdut ) Agreement .

We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected , that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world , and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard ,  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
Attention was drawn to the frequent emphasis placed by international forums on the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights , be they civil , political , economic , social or cultural .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The remark was made that the task of regulating the potentially detrimental external effects of intensive industrial activities not prohibited by international law and finding a balance between the profits derived from such activities and the burden caused to third parties could be achieved in various ways , such as through the polluter-pays principle , which was not applicable in all cases , or through a regime of civil or State liability or through a combination of both .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , the private sector , cooperatives and the civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
The second phase of Operation Joint Guard , the stabilization phase , has now begun , and over the coming months SFOR will continue its efforts to keep the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina by accomplishing its principal military tasks and by providing selective support to the international civil organizations in theatre , thereby contributing to a progressive implementation of broad civilian programmes .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
We would like to express our delight and gratitude to the entire military and civil staff of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan for the devotion and bravery they demonstrated in complicated and often life-threatening situations as they carried out the very difficult duties assigned them by the Security Council .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .

Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .

Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
After the Cairo Conference , the National Department of Health , in collaboration with other Government agencies , the private sector , civil society and donors , prepared our fourth National Health Plan , which encourages a fundamental shift in the way health services are delivered to Papua New Guineans living in urban and rural areas .

It contains details of the sabotage carried out by a New Zealand official working in Iraq under United Nations auspices , and it urges you to investigate this crime and take steps to end violations such as this being committed by persons bearing United Nations identity documents who engage in actions that are incompatible with the most elementary norms and standards governing the work of international civil servants .  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
The Convention favours an integrated approach to those rights , avoiding the categorization of rights that , in previous decades , had separated civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances , or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant , may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .

The Working Group on Global Navigation Satellite Systems concluded that satellite navigation systems should be fully interoperable and transparent to the user and as a consequence recommended that the United States of America and the European Union ( EU ) develop a common definition of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) for civil and public safety services .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development was the culmination of a long process of international deliberation on human rights which were perceived from the very beginning as an integrated whole of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
After that , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 clearly recognized the unity of all those rights and elaborated the theme , as noted later in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that , the ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights , as well as his economic , social and cultural rights .  
However , as the years passed , the post-war solidarity gave way to the cold war and instead of one unified covenant , those rights were codified in 1966 in two international covenants - one on civil and political rights , another on economic , social and cultural rights .  
As early as 1968 , the Proclamation of Tehran stated : since human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible , the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights is impossible .  
In 1969 the Declaration on Social Progress and Development further emphasized the interdependence of these two sets of rights , and by the early 1970s the concept of the right to development emerged as a human right that unified in itself the civil and political rights as well as the economic , social and cultural rights .  
The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
As a result of this consensus , there is now no more room for promoting one set of rights as against another , or putting forward some rights , such as economic and social , to be fulfilled prior to or in violation of civil and political rights , or vice versa .  
Similarly , the recommendation regarding the civil society and non-governmental organizations , encouraging their greater participation , especially of those groups that represent the vulnerable sections , such as the poor , the homeless and the unemployed , and the public interest ( e.g . consumer , environmental , human rights and women 's organizations ) , in the local and national decision-making , would be equally important .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The complementarity of civil and political rights to economic , social and cultural rights must be fully recognized if the latter are to be implemented in accordance with the needs of people and the actual economic potential of the State .  
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
UNCTADs work should therefore be guided by a dual effort at integration and collaboration : integration of its analytical , normative and technical cooperation work , and collaboration with other development-related international organizations , as well as with civil society and the private business sector . 
Despite the widely publicized habit of labelling the battles after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan as a civil war , it can be attested on clear evidence that these wars were staged by the short-sighted and injudicious leaders of Pakistan , as the prime factors and instigators of instability in both Central and South Asia , who , in collaboration with backward and obscurantist elements , pursued their expansionist objectives in Afghanistan .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
The increasing pace of globalization and current developments however , have proved that the structures and practices of globalization itself may often , directly and indirectly , be a cause of violations of human rights , not only with regard to economic , social and cultural rights , but also with regard to civil and political rights .  
The Bureau 's report also appears to overlook the balances achieved in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , reaffirmed the universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated nature of human rights and the need for the international community to treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis .  The Bureau 's report , on the one hand , focuses mainly on promoting civil and political rights .  
As a result , the need to ensure the principle of the indivisibility of human rights by directly addressing the existing imbalance between civil and political rights on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other , appears to have been neglected .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The success of the review of the mechanisms can best be judged by achieving such a balance through concrete proposals , such as assigning equal budgetary and human resources to both civil and political and to economic , social and cultural rights .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .

According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
The results of the latter meeting are expressed in the Rio Declaration , which confirms shared principles and goals regarding trade integration as well as a mutual commitment to the full and unrestricted preservation of democratic institutions and to free , just and open electoral processes , emphasizing the importance of the participation of civil society .  
Following the rejection of the constitutional reforms in the national referendum on 16 May , the Follow-up Commission , a body established under the peace agreements with the authority to reschedule the parties commitments , has dedicated its attention to developing a viable peace agenda , which would enable the completion of the third phase of the timetable , in consultation with those sectors of civil society that are directly involved in the implementation process .  
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .

At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
The meeting concluded that successful gender mainstreaming is more likely to take place in countries where responsibility for it is not located in a single governmental body and where civil society is actively involved in advancing gender-equality issues .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
The broad human rights approach to disability , therefore , takes the view of advancing the rights and well being of all people , regardless of disabilities , through promotion of implementation of general and disability-specific international instruments that encompass civil and political to economic , social and cultural rights for all .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
In collecting information during the four visits for the preparation of the present report , meetings were held with a wide range of personalities from various sectors of Rwandan society : branches of the Government , civil society , members of diplomatic missions and members of United Nations agencies , as well as with some national and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) involved in human rights and related matters in Rwanda .  
The objective is to give the new members of the National Human Rights Commission the opportunity to meet and share views with their colleagues from other parts of the world , representatives from the National Assembly and the Government , the judiciary and civil society , as well as to engage in a wide public debate on how the Commission can be made an independent and effective institution on the basis of recognized international norms .

At the national and international levels , unjust economic , social and political systems which really constitute violations of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights contribute to the birth and / or nurturing of extremism .  
Nevertheless , in spite of the picture of suffering and contrasts which the continent presents to the world ; in spite of the upheavals that wrack its civil societies ; and in spite of all the difficulties draining its capacity to steer its own way through a troublesome environment , Africa has taken the costly and demanding road of renewal that is so necessary if it is to assume control of its own destiny and to achieve a balanced world situation in the future .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
As local institutions , including the court system , have for all practical purposes ceased to function , with the Indonesian civil service , police service , judges , prosecutors and other members of the legal profession having left the territory , the Transitional Administration will be entrusted with the task of rebuilding a structure of governance and administration capable of providing basic public services and a fully functioning administration of justice .

Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Given the continuing volatile security situation in East Timor , the successor force to INTERFET should have a robust operational mandate .  24 .  As indicated in the first periodic report , it is imperative that urgent steps be taken to address the absence of effective civil administration in East Timor and that the civil administration elements of UNTAET be brought forward as much as possible .  
Among them are an elected Government that enjoys widespread legitimacy within the population a rare fact in the aftermath of a war ; a strong and active civil society ; a fabric of national cohesion , without significant polarization along ethnic or religious lines ; a land endowed with rich soil and considerable mineral resources ; and a tradition of higher education .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
Successful elements of those strategies included increasing penetration of external markets ; facilitating access to imported inputs ; creating an enabling environment ; improving universal primary education and access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology ; promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the competence of the civil service .

Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
At the legislative level , womens civil status continued to be restricted ; despite the ratification of international instruments , the offending provisions in the laws had not been amended .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .  
Recalling further that these initiatives called for , inter alia , discussions on these themes on the basis of in-depth reports at the global , regional and national levels by intergovernmental , governmental , diplomatic , academic and civil society3 experts at conferences , seminars and other meetings as well as through the Internet , to be reported on to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session ,  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .

Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
He concluded that such cases must not have occurred in his jurisdiction since the Cameroonian public knew perfectly well to whom it could complain , that is , to the divisional superintendent or to his fourth assistant , responsible for civil security and investigation of police officers , and that he was not aware of any such complaint being lodged .  
The requirement , under the revised methodology , that the public sector should be represented by at least 25 per cent of the employers surveyed was a violation of the Flemming principle , since not all national civil services accurately reflected the best prevailing local conditions .  
It was high time that the basic rights recognized for national civil services and enshrined in ILO Conventions No . 98 and No . 154 should be recognized , with appropriate adjustments , for the international civil service , since it was unthinkable that ILO and the international financial institutions should fail to apply internally the basic rules they would like to see implemented internationally .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .

The Special Rapporteur notes that the civil society , including NGOs , the media and private individuals , has often been instrumental in pressing the competent authorities to launch inquiries into incidents of extrajudicial killings or to reopen investigations into cases already considered closed .  
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
The European Union attached great importance to the commitments made by all countries and major groups to the implementation of the principles of the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 ; it believed that the enhancement of public awareness was essential and engaged in continuous dialogue with civil society on environmental matters .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism , in all its forms and manifestations , as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of States ;

They understand the laws that are relevant to their activities through commentaries and publications ranging from government and professional gazettes to the documents of interest groups and the public media , and the viability of these in providing diverse , accurate and accessible information is an important support structure for the rule of law in civil societies .  
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development ( Agenda for Development ( General Assembly resolution 51 / 240 , annex ) , para . 
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
The universal implementation of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political , is the surest preventive strategy and the most effective way of avoiding the emergence of conflict .  
All human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ; equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of both civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
The view was expressed that an educational institution should have been included among the public non-profit sector employers in order to have at least one employer working in the same substantive field as UNESCO , instead of four financial sector employers . 6 Furthermore , it would have been preferable if a more representative employer such as the French career civil service or the Ministry of Culture ( instead of the Snat ) , had been included . 
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
The strong plea of the High Commission is : let us , in the coming century , prevent gross violations of human rights , economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance .

While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .  
Adopted in 1997 , after broad discussions with decentralized communities , civil society , the private sector and donors , this programme aims to improve the living conditions of the poorest population by increasing the income of the poor through the promotion of micro-enterprises and income-generating activities ; improving provision to meet basic social needs ; and establishing a permanent follow-up system on household living conditions .  
Does anyone in this Hall believe that they might read on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable future that a South-East Asian country has requested or received a mandate from the Security Council to intervene , without the consent of the White House , in a civil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been unable to control , a conflict resulting from wild actions of the famous local militias ? 
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
My delegation intends to play an active role in the preparations for the informal process , seeking to ensure broad input from all relevant actors , including regional organizations , various parts of the United Nations and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 , including civil society .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
The Government and the civil society of Yemen are working closely and strenuously to make democracy an irreversibly solid trend of national policy and an evolutionary process , so that democracy will ultimately become the focal point of political , social and economic life in Yemen .

Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Fostering functional and democratically accountable common institutions supported by an effective , meritbased civil service and a sound financial basis , based on the Rule of Law .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development ;  
Lastly , he stressed the importance of moving beyond the NorthSouth divide and developing partnerships with key nongovernmental actors in globalization , including international economic institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
Mr . Jayanama ( Thailand ) , speaking under subitems 114 ( b ) and ( e ) , stressed the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and the importance of giving equal attention to civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . 
Australia , Canada and New Zealand strongly supported the proactive measures that had been taken to achieve a more versatile , multiskilled and experienced international civil service that truly reflected the Organizations global reach .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development ;  
The history of our countries in the decade just past has been marked by a plethora of bloody national and civil conflicts and an unprecedented intensification of ethnic , political and social enmity , xenophobia and alienation .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
In light of the work of the Committee and of the latest scientific research , it is obvious that economic , social and cultural rights are as justiciable as civil and political rights .  
Welcomes the hearings held with civil society to support the financing for development process , looks forward to the contribution of the upcoming hearings with the private sector , and encourages the deepening of these efforts in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ;  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
If new , more flexible contractual arrangements were to be developed so as to respond to the changing requirements of employing organizations , they would need to be within an overall , standard framework that ensured the continued existence and viability of the international civil service .  
They do not exempt international civil servants from observing local laws , nor do they provide an excuse for ignoring private legal or financial obligations .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
In conclusion , I should like to say that I was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors and of Congolese people of all persuasions to preserve their national unity ; by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country ; and by the resilience and determination of local communities and the youth .  A united , peaceful and vigorous Congo is good for Congolese children .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
Other actors , such as regional organizations , the international financial institutions and civil society , also have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen their capacity to respond to factors such as exclusion and inequality , which , if left unchecked , can spark violent confrontations .  
If international and regional conflicts were once a result of the cold-war climate that then prevailed , the past decade , which saw the end of the cold war , was marked by regional and civil strife that was more brutal , more tragic and more devastating than the conflicts of the cold-war era .  
Suffice it to say that we are deeply concerned not only by the casual manner of according a parallel status to this bunch of discredited criminals , but also by the dilution of and utter disregard for the popular will of Somali civil society , which has throughout borne the full brunt of egregious human rights violations perpetrated by the same individuals . 
The United Nations Development Group and the people of East Timor trust that the Council will find the means to guarantee that the United Nations , complemented by generous voluntary contributions , can complete the tasks it was charged with : to put in place not only support elements for the fledgling civil service , but also major programmes for long-term capacity-building and poverty eradication .  Thus will we help put in place a strong , confident and capable Government in East Timor with the capacity and the commitment to meet the needs of all its citizens .  
However , they will not be regarded as a process of development , as objects of claim , as human rights , so long as they are attended by increased inequalities or disparities and rising concentrations of wealth and economic power , and without any improvement in indicators of social development , education , health , gender balance and environmental protection and , what is most important , if they are associated with any violation of civil and political rights .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
He described the right to development as a vector composed of various elements including the right to food , the right to health , the right to education , the right to housing and other economic , social and cultural rights , as well as all the civil and political rights together with the rates of growth of GDP and other financial , technical and institutional resources that enable any improvement in the well-being of the entire population and the realization of the rights to be sustained .  
Since the right to development has been recognized as a human right distinct from the individual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , it is indeed necessary to consider a monitoring mechanism that is separate from the treaty bodies .  
His Government planned to involve civil society , particularly non-governmental organizations , in implementing the new approach and was engaged in consultations with them on a number of issues ( inter alia , improving the living conditions of displaced persons in camps , protecting their civil rights , implementing job-creation projects for them , improving understanding of the basic principles of the new UNHCR approach ) .  
All forms of human rights civil , cultural , economic , social and political are integral and indivisible rights of our peoples .  
The participants in the regional workshops have included : representatives of institutions involved in disaster reduction , civil protection and emergency response activities ; representatives of international and regional organizations involved in supporting disaster management ; representatives of space agencies with activities related to disaster management ; and experts in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communications and positioning via satellites .  
The Supreme Council agreed that nationals of GCC countries employed in the civil service of any member State should , while serving , be treated in the same manner as nationals of the State to which they are assigned , in accordance with the provisions set forth in the decision of the ministers responsible for central civil service agencies in the GCC countries .  
Mauritanian legislation covers the fundamental rights and duties of persons , nationality , alien residency requirements , electoral regulations and territorial division into constituencies , regulations governing the ownership of property , the general organization of the civil service , economic and social activities of the State and so forth .  
The Declaration provides guidance for realizing development and human rights in a complementary and comprehensive manner , and identifies international cooperation as a duty of the international community ; in this framework , international cooperation should focus on the elimination of obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the formulation of international development policies for ensuring development and eliminating obstacles thereto .  
To recognize the place and facilitate the continued involvement of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , the media and traditional moral authorities , enabling them , in the public interest , to participate actively in a balanced political life ;  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
By social protection , we understand the responsibility of societies to see that the fundamental needs of all are met , based on universal human rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna had reached consensus on areas for action and objectives for the promotion of human rights , which no longer covered only civil and political rights but also , on an equal footing , economic , social and cultural rights .  
The policy of civil harmony , introduced by the President of the Republic and clearly ratified by popular referendum , the goodwill and clemency measures , and the unusual openness in the political arena and among the communications media reflected the determination of the Algerian people and of the public authorities to continue to strengthen the democratic process , creating a genuine culture of human rights and a more just society , without fear or arbitrariness .  
The unhealthy tendency to overstate alleged violations of civil and political rights with a view to satisfying special interest groups or domestic constituencies had become a characteristic of the Third Committees country-specific draft resolutions .  
Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to protect human rights and ensure fundamental freedoms , gross human rights violations continued to occur in many areas of the world , particularly areas embroiled in civil wars and conflicts , during which innocent civilians , including children and women , were victims of the indiscriminate use of force .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
The member countries had at their disposal various regional and international legal instruments to guide them in the defence and promotion of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which had been ratified by all the member countries of the Rio Group , and the instruments drawn up by the Inter-American Childrens Institute , founded in 1927 with the aim of supporting policies relating to childhood , fostering the bonds between the State and civil society , and shaping a regional awareness of the problems of children . 
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
Chile was a nation acting in full unison with the international community , possessed of a civil society that was increasingly involved in national affairs , a respect for human rights and the rule of law and courts that dispensed justice strictly and responsibly , a nation with an open , booming economy , which was working steadily to do away with inequalities .  
His Government had always attached great importance to the protection of human rights , whether civil , political , economic , social or cultural , as reflected in his countrys Constitution , which guaranteed all citizens those rights .  
Three major issues have emerged from the workshops and consultations held and the feedback from country teams that have been involved in consultations with the World Bank as well as from the joint learning group on the CDF and PRSPs , which meets periodically and maintains continual electronic contact among its members : ( a ) enhancing national ownership of processes ; ( b ) improving participation of different actors , particularly civil society ; and ( c ) ensuring a substantive contribution of UNDP and the other United Nations agencies and entities .  
The need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction whatsoever , was also underlined .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
The Committee recommends that the State party take all effective measures , including enacting or rescinding legislation where necessary , to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition , exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil , economic , political , social and cultural life .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Likewise , it was considered prudent to retain the primacy of the sectoral conventions since they included specific and more elaborate provisions on the acts in question , for example in the field of civil aviation and maritime safety , which were not included in the comprehensive convention .  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Strongly condemns extremist violence in certain municipalities in southern Serbia and welcomes the plan of the Federal and Republic Governments to resolve the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia peacefully , including political and economic reform designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society , and calls for a rapid implementation of the plan ;  
Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
There are encouraging signs of a nascent democratic process involving broad segments of Angolans , including civil society , on the need for the drafting of a new Constitution , the debate over a new press law and on the need to ensure free and fair elections in late 2002 .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Council in its resolution 11 ( II ) of 21 June 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports to the Council on promoting womens rights in political , economic , civil , social and educational fields and to make recommendations to the Council on urgent problems requiring immediate attention in the field of womens rights with the object of implementing the principle that men and women shall have equal rights , and to develop proposals to give effect to such recommendations .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts , methods and practices of terrorism , regardless of their motivation , in all their forms and manifestations , wherever and by whomever committed , as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone , both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development ;  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
Other essential factors in promoting the mobilization of domestic resources for development are political stability , good governance and the rule of law , a sound and transparent legal system , guarantees for private investors , transparency in public administration , markets and companies , respect for contract law and private property , efforts to combat corruption at the national and international levels , the participation of citizens and civil society in public life , and equal access to resources for women and men .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
The period following his election , until his inauguration as President on 7 February was marked by a concerted civil society effort to promote political dialogue ; questionable opposition moves to form an alternative government ; and a climate of tension and threats accompanied by intermittent bombings .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code , a code on criminal procedures , a new civil code and a code of civil procedure , the reform of the administration of justice and enhancing the training of judges and lawyers , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty , including its most persistent forms , and the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals ,  
Reaffirming the human right to be free from discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights as stipulated , inter alia , in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ,  
How can the international community support national efforts to tap civil society and private sector resources to contribute to the provision of infrastructure and social services , so that public resources can be concentrated in other areas where there can be no substitute for government activity ?  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Underscore the need to promote strategies , programmes and policies , which may include measures of affirmative action , for furthering the fulfilment of civil and political rights for victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including through more effective access to the political , judicial and administrative functions of institutions , as well as the need to increase access to the administration of justice in all its forms , free from racial discrimination of any kind ;  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Also invite them to ensure their full enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in particular women , children and vulnerable groups , so that persons who admit to an HIV infection , those presumably infected and other persons affected are protected against violence , stigmatization , discrimination , unemployment and other negative consequences which may be compounded by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
This encompasses a broad and balanced approach , placing equal emphasis on all human rights civil and political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development .  
The United Nations system should be conscious of these perceptions ; point to the accountability and transparency mechanisms that are built in the functioning of the different agencies ( from the tripartite structure of ILO , to the requirements for parliamentary ratification of World Trade Organization legal instruments ) ; and continue to expand its outreach to all elements of civil society , from parliamentarians and local authorities to professional societies .  
The attitude of the Congolese people , as reflected by a wide range of civil society organizations , religious groups and opposition political parties whom the Council mission met in Kinshasa and elsewhere , suggests that the country is eager to move forward towards national reconciliation , democratization and development , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in a climate of political plurality .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
While the rights enumerated in the Covenant , such as the right to an adequate standard of living , are of central importance to the poor , the Committee emphasizes that all civil and political rights , as well as the right to development , are also indispensable to those living in poverty.g  
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .  
Both these undertakings require an effective , trained and motivated workforce , operating within the confines of professionally managed establishments that are capable of undertaking major civil engineering work on an ongoing basis .  
Specifically designed to ensure an inclusive approach , the JWG is composed of representatives of the three major Kosovo Albanian political parties , a Kosovo Serb member ( who withdrew following the initial session and was replaced on 13 April by another representative of the Kosovo Serb community ) , a Bosniac who represented Kosovos other minority communities , a representative of civil society and an independent expert , as well as seven international members , including an international chairman .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
In May 2001 , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights adopted a statement on poverty which recognizes that poverty constitutes a denial of human rights and defines poverty as a human condition characterized by the deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights ( A / CONF . 191 / BP / 7 ) .  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Urge the international community , particularly donor countries , civil society , as well as the private sector to complement effectively national programmes to support programmes for children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV / AIDS in affected regions , in countries at high risk and to direct special assistance to sub-Saharan Africa ;  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
It reiterated its unequivocal condemnation of the acts , methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy , threatening the territorial integrity and security of States , destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments , undermining pluralistic civil society and having adverse consequences for economic and social development .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
Calls upon States to promote and implement legal provisions and public policies ensuring Roma communities institutional development , their equal enjoyment of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , their equal access to development resources and their full participation in decision-making process in central and local public administration , as recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its General Recommendation XXVII entitled Discrimination against Roma .  
Greater emphasis should be placed on teaching the history of national , racial , linguistic , cultural , religious and ethnic minorities [ and of the history of neighbouring countries ] with the aim of achieving mutual respect and understanding for others culture , religion or history / as well as of their contribution to the whole civil society ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
We are convinced that the United Nations system is uniquely placed to play a key role in supporting Africas efforts and to help create a momentum for a productive and mutually beneficial partnership between Africa and the international community and civil society , including the private sector .  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
The members of these Councils included representatives of teachers , parents , students and government authorities at the municipal , departmental and national levels and , where appropriate , representatives of indigenous organizations , the private sector , universities and other sectors of civil society connected with educational development .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
The main characteristic of the period under review has been the large number of complaints of threats , harassment and intimidation against persons and institutions working for the protection of human rights , civil servants , persons involved in judicial proceedings and journalists critical of public authorities .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
While it was recognized that the primary responsibility for development in least developed countries rested with the least developed countries themselves , the Brussels Declaration acknowledged that their efforts needed to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships , inter alia , with the civil society and the private sector .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Preparations for the practical establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission were given impetus by a seminar on operational and managerial aspects of the Sierra Leone truth and reconciliation commission held in Freetown from 29 May to 1 June 2001 , and attended by representatives of the Government and the local diplomatic community , civil society organizations and the UNAMSIL leadership . 
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
Secondly , he discussed the Programme for Comprehensive Development of Indigenous Communities which had four main components : the financing of economically productive initiatives aimed at raising the standard of living , health services that combined traditional and occidental medicine , intercultural bilingual education aimed at strengthening ancestral culture and , finally , strengthening of indigenous communities and capacity-building of civil servants working with the indigenous population .  
Recalling that , in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic , social and cultural rights , as well as his or her civil and political rights ,  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
He recognized the interconnectedness of economics and politics and made a reference to the universally recognized understanding that all rights civil , political , economic , social and cultural , and the right to development are indivisible and interconnected .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative was particularly impressed and encouraged by the commitment of all sectors of Congolese society to preserve their national unity , by the strength and engagement of civil society throughout the country , and by the resilience and determination of local communities and young people .  A united , peaceful and vigorous country is good for Congolese children , it is good for the development and future of Africa and it is good for international peace and security .  
It was greatly heartened to witness the sterling work of those delegations and members of civil society that have , in a few short years , transformed the anti-landmines movement into a workable convention , whose provisions are respected not only by the ever-increasing number of States parties but also by non - parties , whose actions are coloured by the moral strength of the Convention .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
Through the efforts of UNOA and in particular of my Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa , as well as my Representative in Angola , broad contacts have been established with the Government , political parties , civil society , and the church which could provide a strong support base in the common search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict . 
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
Tajikistan has suffered from a severe drought over the past two years , which has severely compounded the economic problems created by several years of civil conflict that resulted in destruction of the basic social and economic infrastructure and a sharp decline in living standards .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
It had been encouraging to see the positive response of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and civil society to forging a partnership with the United Nations system in order to advance the global efforts to bridge the digital divide .  69 .  His own Government had adopted a comprehensive approach to the promotion of science and technology .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
Invites Member States , in collaboration with the United Nations organizations and civil society , to place a renewed focus on the issue of improving the situation of rural women in implementing at both national and international levels the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome document6 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session , taking into account also the conclusions and recommendations of the United Nations expert group meeting on the situation of rural women within the context of globalization , held in 2001 , by , inter alia :

While the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rested with those countries themselves , their efforts must be supplemented by concrete and substantial support from the international community , in a spirit of shared responsibility and genuine partnership which included civil society and the private sector .  
Debt relief was one way to free resources for investment and poverty eradication , but , if it was genuinely to improve economic and social conditions in the poorest countries , it must be accompanied by sound domestic economic and budgetary policies , supported by the civil society of the countries concerned .

Considering that there is a close relationship between the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and the realization of civil and political rights , since the various categories of rights constitute an indissoluble whole based on recognition of the dignity of the human person and therefore require permanent protection and promotion with a view to ensuring their full realization , so that there can never be any justification for violating one category of rights in order to realize others ,  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;

With regard to the possible appointment of an independent expert on the issue of impunity , the Commission stated that , as impunity is a complex topic , impunity for violations of civil and political rights and for violations of economic and social rights give rise to different problems and should be treated separately . 
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .
