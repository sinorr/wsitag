This is so even though U.S . Central Intelligence Agency has already tried every possible means to collect and analyze intelligence on Iraq .  
The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .

In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;

We must resolutely prevent and overcome bureaucratic working styles such as being detached from the masses and taking advantage of official posts .  We must resolutely prevent and overcome formalist working styles such as pursuing undeserved reputations and paying no attention to real results .  
In accordance with the DPRK Constitution , which was amended in 1998 , DPRK has allowed official organs , enterprises , or organizations to cooperate with the foreign legal persons or individuals in operation and has encouraged all types of enterprise operational activities in its designated " special economic zones .

Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
Gu Angran said : As reported by judicial organs , a more prominent problem that needs prompt solution at the moment is the question of what kind of work performed by personnel of such rural grass-roots organizations as villagers ' committees in assisting the people 's governments would subject them to the description of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  Therefore , the draft interpretation includes a stipulation only on this matter rather than on the full range of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  
Instructions , requirements , and working plans from superiors are transmitted through computers , entrusted tasks and work arrangements for the lower levels are received and processed by computers , work implementation progress reports and proposals are also submitted through computer systems , and electronic mail is gradually replacing official documents and the telephone .

In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
Fujian has promulgated and put into effect the " Fujian Management Regulations for Coastal Shipping , Border Defense , and Public Security " , setting up a " top official " leadership responsibility system for fighting illegal emigration , for a harsh crackdown by law on snake-heads and human smugglers .  And it has set up an exclusive snake-head crackdown taskforce , engaging in " online snake-head arrests " , all of which steps show Fujian 's firm stand and resolve against illegal emigration .  
To get a grip on one key , leaders are required to play an exemplary role .  Meanwhile , leading cadres should set strict demands on themselves , be just and upright , honestly perform official duties , play an exemplary role , and foster a good image among the people .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
It consisted of more than 5,000 people , making it the largest such delegation ever .

As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .

Military exercises have been held without interruption .  What is different is that these military exercises have not been conducted in the areas sensitive to Taiwan and have been announced , as were before , by Beijing 's official authorities in a low key through the sensational Hong Kong media .

This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .

The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .

lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate .

Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .

His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .

A series of social issues arising from the growing unemployment rate have emerged , public order is worsening , and the suicide rate is accelerating .  What is even more worrisome is that Taiwan authorities feel quite helpless about the issue of unemployment at this point .

We will investigate and deal with the evasion of public bidding in the course of launching construction projects , fraud during the bidding process , transfer of contracts , illegal subcontracting , contracting for projects without proper documents or for projects that exceed official limits , and activities that violate legally stipulated construction procedures , that do not enforce mandatory technical standards , that involve shoddy work and the use of inferior materials , and that pass substandard buildings off as buildings of good quality .  
Apart from the fact that the mental concepts of certain cadres are outdated and they long for the stuff of planned economy , an important reason why regional blockades persist in some areas despite repeated prohibition is that instead of doing their work in a thoroughly sound way , certain leading cadres depend on improper methods such as regional blockades to pursue " achievements in their official career , " and do not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the masses and the state for the sake of pursuing their own benefit .  
After the trial , the Chengdu Intermediate People 's Court held that Zhang Yuren , as a state official , abused power to illegally accept 200,000 shares of the Jinding Company and the Emei Iron and Alloy Company , and got 3.95-million yuan by selling the shares .  Zhang also sought benefits for his collaborators .  His behavior constituted a crime of bribery .  The court 's first trial made the aforementioned verdict as his offense involved a huge sum of money .

He pointed out that the Falungong organization , which uses the Clearwisdom.net website [ official website of Falungong in Hong Kong ] as its representative , is in the habit of inventing facts and confusing right and wrong , and thus as the director of the facility with intimate knowledge of this issue , he was extremely surprised to hear these rumors [ from the foreign press ] .

The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .

As a matter of fact , the mainland has explained the content of the " one country , two systems " in the past through various channels .

The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?

A military official has commented that the new government may very likely be drawn into a scandal in future in the " underwater sonic detection system " cooperation program , just like the scandals surrounding the purchases of French Lafayette frigates that troubled the previous government .  
in this respect , a total of 17 provincial ( ministerial ) - level cadres were involved in the cases .  Early this year , Hu Changqing , ex-deputy governor of Jiangxi Province , was sentenced to death for extensively taking and demanding large bribes , thereby becoming the highest ranking official sentenced to death for corruption in China since the 1960s .  
The " punishment " against those responsible persons by the US side was like a trifling matter .  It only dismissed an unnamed middle level official of the Central Intelligence Bureau , and the seven low-level working personnel only received punishments of not being promoted for two to three years .  
A responsible official from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People 's Congress [ NPC ] today commented here on the anti-China resolutions on Taiwan and Tibet adopted by the European Parliament [ EP ] .

"

"  
The perspective given to people from the meaning within the words was not so much wanting to show good intentions , but hinging on the elaborate style of the wording , seemed to show the new official Taiwan leadership is lacking sufficient understanding of the serious situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . The cunning application of wording was greater than that allotted to practical considerations , and the elaborate portion was greater than the revealing of sincere feelings .  
A relevant official of the Guangxi Regional Public Security Department said that in future , Guangxi will continue to resolutely and severely punish criminal acts of violating regulations on gun management , will not relax its work to seize illegal guns and ammunitions , will strive to confiscate all guns once they are discovered , and will go all out to eliminate the hidden danger to social order and ensure the people to live and work in peace and contentment .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
A responsible official of a relevant department in Fujian Province said on 22 June : The Fujian Provincial Government expressed deep regrets for the 58 alleged stowaways who suffocated in a container seated on a truck in Britain 's Dover port , and condemned the criminal act of international organized criminal syndicates .  
Commenting on reports by some mass media that the dead of the Dover tragedy came from Fujian , the responsible official said : The Fujian Provincial Government is paying very close attention to the case .  It has conducted a two-day house-to-house investigation in Fuqing and Changle where illegal emigration was rampant .  It has also decided and made preparations : When necessary , it will send a deputy secretary general of the Fujian Provincial Government and responsible officials from relevant departments to Britain to help identify the dead and deal with the aftermath of the Dover tragedy .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
People have also noticed that all the six countries Li Peng has visited have invariably reiterated that they support the principle of One China and hope to see China 's complete reunification be realized on an earlier date .  They have also made it clear that they will develop no official relations with Taiwan . This shows that the Chinese Government 's principle of safeguarding national reunification has been recognized by the international community at large .  
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .  
Responsible official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stressed today that all party committees , governments , and discipline inspection and supervisory organs should strengthen the supervision over the behaviors of enterprise leading cadres in doing operational and managerial activities , should earnestly implement the relevant regulations on the responsibility system for building party style and administrative honesty , and should resolutely investigate and deal with without any lenient behaviors that have caused tremendous losses to the state due to duty dereliction .  
Various provincial ( regional , or municipal ) and prefecture ( city ) party committees should conscientiously perform their official duties and should grasp in real earnest the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level as the first and foremost task of our party building work .

Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .

The high-ranking MND official pointed out : In recent months , the Chinese Communists have not engaged in any large-scale exercises along the coast , nor have there been unusual troop movements .  It is possible that the Chinese Communists are trying to create an atmosphere favorable to the opening of small-scale three links .  Our military has put in place defense and relevant security measures on the offshore islands .  Having inferred possible scenarios , the MND has concluded that there is no need to adjust the military strength on the offshore islands in the near future .  
The official said emphatically : Using simulated systems , our military long ago practiced ways of coping with possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops and came up with several contingency plans .

As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
Two , we must give top priority to case investigation and make breakthroughs in some typical cases of violation of law and discipline , especially cases of trickery to defraud state investments , abuse of official position to engage in graft and corruption , abuse of official power to seek private gains , and cases where dereliction of duty have resulted in poor construction quality that leads to accidents and cases of corruption hidden behind substandard construction work and so on .  We must put a firm grip on these cases and thoroughly investigate them .

Under the conditions of reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , party cadres must make greater effort to build up their party spirit , adopt a correct attitude toward power , position , interests , have the ability to resist the corrosive influence of various decadent ideas , and set a good example in working hard , living thriftily , and performing official duties honestly and uncorruptly .

It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair .

The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
The Ching dynasty had strict rules determining what class of people could build what sort of house , but the relative absence of authority in north Taiwan allowed Lin , who had no official status , to construct a house with upturned eaves , a privilege reserved for the powerful .  
Lu reports that one day in the late nineteenth century , a chef for an official family heard his employer singing the praises of a great dish he had just eaten , an exquisite meal of duck and chicken baked in a wine jug . The first efforts at imitation were less than ideal , so the official took the cook to the original house to learn it straight from the wife who had prepared the dinner . Later , when the chef started his own restaurant , he kept adding to and improving the recipe .

As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan .

Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
We must , however , proceed with extreme caution in our mainland policy . For obvious reasons , our first concern must continue to be our national security . And our policy of no official contact with the Chinese Communist regime will remain unchanged . President Lee Teng-hui summed it up well when he declared that our mainland policy can not be based on a romantic longing , but is a serious task that must be carefully undertaken .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University .

Facelift for a Venerable Career - - Taiwan 's Changing Civil Service " Ten years obscurely spent in studious poverty / Are crowned , th'examination pass 'd , with vast celebrity . " In traditional China , where learned scholarship was always regarded as the noblest vocation , to become a government official was every scholar 's highest ideal .  
The problem is that our civil servants have not yet comprehended this shift , and are still stuck in the thinking and methods of the 1950 ' s . They just think about playing the leading role and telling others what they should do and ca n't do , which product to develop - - these are not official topics , so there are always conflicts with private entrepreneurs . In fact in many things the people are more capable than officials .  
With English as its official language , obviating the need to learn another foreign language , along with its relative proximity to Taiwan , its similarity in climate and its spacious and comfortable living environment , Australia makes for a highly competitive choice .

From being elected to the Legislative Yuan with the highest number of votes in the country , to his " change in careers " to become an executive branch official , Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shau-kong has used his broad public support as his shield in undertaking the work of protecting the environment .

Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again !

"  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue .

Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching . Only this counts as a full performance . After the evil spirits were expelled and thanks given to the gods , with easy hearts people returned to the normal order of their lives .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents .

Riding into history : There is no singing or lyrics and no dialogue , only three to five roles , and a horse 's head and horse tail carried along by the " imperial examination candidate . " The puma company relates stories like that of the unrefined examination hopeful who keeps falling off his horse or of the crazy old official , an equally incompetent equestrian , going on an inspection tour .  
Come and meet the In-specting King !

The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor .

The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
As official agencies and renowned international economic think tanks release optimistic forecasts for 1995 , an American economist , Ravi Batra , has struck an independent note . As the title of his book The World Great Depression suggests , he predicts there will be a global economic disaster in 1995 .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual .

The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala .

Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland .

The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Later , a corrupt official threatens to expose Shao 's mistaken identity . The intense exchange between the two captivates the audience . When there is a pause that lasts a minute or so , there is not the slightest sound on stage or off , with only the faint whirr of the air conditioning disturbing the silence .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual . But this time the curators filed the application , and after careful consideration of the Biennale selection committee , it was accepted . Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
As the president 's official photographer , Kao 's choice of angle when photographing him was tempered by the desire to maintain the national leader 's dignity . The pictures which political photojournalists love to take of politicians distressed or dispirited , yawning or picking their noses , are nowhere to be seen in Kao 's archives . " What 's the point of taking those ? When I did happen to get shots like that , I destroyed them , " says Kao .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] . The almanac showed outstanding calculating capability , being comparable to the official version , published shortly after Hong 's , in defining the traditional 24 " solar periods " ( climatic stages of the year ) . Hong 's work was very well-received .  
Tsai Jui-yueh , a quiet and cultured native of the old city of Tainan , ignored these criticisms . Resolutely maintaining her position , she headed north to Taipei the next year , and in the City Hall put on " The First Exhibition of Tsai Jui-yueh 's Creative Dance " accompanied by the official provincial orchestra . The performance was an eye-opener for the many who had never seen a dance performance before .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories . Given the official endorsement by Confucius , and its immense popularity among the literati of the Han , Wei , and Six Dynasties , it gained a reputation as an activity suitable for refined persons , and it maintained an elegant image .  
In 1553 , during the Ming dynasty , after a Portuguese " tribute ship " was blown aground , the Portuguese captain asked to lease a nearby fishing village to dry out the goods . A local maritime official acceded to the request . In 1614 , after the Portuguese had assisted the Ming court in defeating pirates , Viceroy Zhang Ming-gang secured the emperor 's consent to allow Portuguese to settle permanently in Macau .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
On August 21 , the task force announced that Yin 's murder had been planned out in advance by persons who were currently active in the military service . One was Captain Chen Lu-tseng , chief of staff for former Navy Commander-in-Chief Chuang Ming-yao . Another was a high-ranking military official whose identity is too sensitive to reveal .  
The innkeeper could only shake his head and watch as Wu wobbled off up the road . After a while Wu passed an official notice warning about the tiger , and realized that the innkeeper had spoken the truth . He considered turning round but then thought better of it , worried that he 'd look stupid if he went back to the inn .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks . He would often be awakened by phone calls in the middle of the night-having just got to sleep after yet another busy day . His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
( AFP , Washington ) Citing the confidential assessment report from the Pentagon , a US defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12-million .  That figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .  
official statistics reported that inflation in the first quarter was running at a monthly rate of 6 4 percent as compared with the previous same period , further lowering romanians ' living standard  
a chinese foreign ministry official said li and rabuka exchanged views on bilateral relations , the international and regional situations and other issues of common concern  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
Four additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1316 ) .  
Establishment of formal , official and effective public service rules and regulations and a contingent of public servants qualified , capable and skilled in the management of the public administration system in new stages of development ;  
There are complex cases in which allegations of mercenary activities in domestic conflicts are reported by international press sources and specialized analysts , but are denied or met with a dogged silence when information is sought from official sources .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
Two additional manuals , one on public and official use for civil registration and vital statistics records and another on population , education and communication for civil registration , are being planned and are expected to be completed in 1996 .  
Equally satisfying in our opinion is the compromise solution reached after long discussion , namely to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly a single compendium including the valuable joint assessment , prepared by the two Vice-Chairmen in their personal capacity , of the two rolling papers on clusters 1 and 2 , as well as proposals and contributions presented by individual countries and groups of countries .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
In the light of the urgency of the need to find timely and effective approaches for addressing the issue , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria , Greece , Moldova , Romania and Ukraine came forward with a set of specific proposals in a joint letter to the Secretary-General of 18 May 1995 , circulated as an official United Nations document ( A / 50 / 189 ) .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
With regard to this recommendation , it was clarified that JIU recommended not the establishment of a new post but the designation of " a competent senior official with extensive managerial experience , who will be a focal point and held accountable for the firm implementation of the current restructuring process " .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
UNHCR responded that it was unable to associate itself with that action , explaining that the registration of spontaneous returnees was directly linked with , and complementary to , the simultaneous official voluntary repatriation process under the terms of the quadripartite agreement . 
Furthermore , the practice of organizing a small group into an official unit complete with a unit chief requires careful consideration given the status associated with " bosses " , and the potential for " mini " bureaucracies to develop .  19 .  In terms of specific findings relating to these small units , electronic data-processing personnel were found to have been scattered across the Division in one or two units within each Service .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
These included two introductory posters , published in 1990 and 1991 , and a major campaign poster in the six official languages , published in 1992 ; a press kit , three public television announcements and two documentary films on single-parent families and on the family and ageing , produced by the Department of Public Information ; a regularly updated calendar of events related to the Year ; stickers on the Year and the International Day of Families .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
At the polling stations , voters were to present to the referendum administrators , in the presence of various Iraqi security forces and Baath Party officials , the first part of the ballot card together with official papers verifying their identity and eligibility , whereupon voters were directed to complete the second part of the card in a separate booth and then to place their completed ballots into an opaque sealed box .  
In the light of this and against the backdrop of the current climate of budgetary stringency and scarcity of official development assistance , two major policy issues have been identified : ( a ) how to improve aid allocations to the least developed countries ; and ( b ) how to enhance the quality and effectiveness of assistance .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
It recognizes the efforts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to incorporate social development into their policies and programmes in a variety of ways and more intensively than in the past , as well as the urgent need for the international community to make efforts to reach as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance .  It also endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 , on new and innovative ideas to generate new funds .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and increase the share of funding for social development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .

Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
The Fund is a strong advocate of the 20 / 20 initiative , which is aimed at mobilizing the additional resources needed from the national budget and official development assistance to achieve the internationally agreed social goals adopted at the World Summit for Social Development and other international conferences convened during the first half of the 1990s .  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
Informal , democratic , transparent , universal , open and announced negotiations held in this official Headquarters with technical services can not be replaced by other forms of negotiations which , in lacking these elements , could only be considered complementary to them , if even that .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Heavier penalties may be applied under other statutes for acquiring a passport or another travel document in an unlawful manner by providing false information or intentionally concealing facts or contributing to incorrect information on official documents ; acquiring more than one passport or travel document for an unlawful purpose ; altering or removing parts of official travel documents for an unlawful purpose ; entering or exiting the country without reporting to passport control authorities ; or taking part in the concealment of a foreign national .  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
If it is committed by any State body or official , acting within its / his authority or ultra vires , it is considered to be an act by the State ( regardless whether it is suitable for discussion at the international level ) . 
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
The official results of the elections were announced on 30 April 1997 and confirmed by the Electoral Appeals Commission , which reported that most complaints received were addressed by the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day , or dismissed after due consideration . 
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
I hereby kindly request you to consider this memorandum as an official document , and to distribute it as such to the distinguished members of the forty _ ninth session of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , currently being held in Geneva , as well as to the members of the upcoming fifty _ fourth session of the Commission on Human Rights under item 4 of its provisional agenda .  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
During plenary meetings of the Conference , delegations reaffirmed or further elaborated their respective positions on the agenda item , the detailed descriptions of which were duly recorded in the plenary records of this session as well as in the previous annual reports of the Conference , in particular paragraphs 41-56 of the 1992 report to the General Assembly of the United Nations ( CD / 1173 ) and related official documents and working papers .

The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
On a collective basis , symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation , such as formal public recognition by the State of its responsibility , or official declarations aimed at restoring victims ' dignity , commemorative ceremonies , naming of public thoroughfares or the erection of monuments , help to discharge the duty of remembrance .  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .  
In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
The Principles also provide that persons alleged to have committed these grave human rights violations should be suspended from any official duties during the investigation and removed from any position of control or power , whether direct or indirect .  
We need maximum official development assistance at the required international level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to aid us in our war against illegal drugs .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
The fact that an act of corruption of a public official has been committed within the sphere of operations of the organized criminal group to facilitate its unlawful activities shall be regarded as a specific aggravating circumstance .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Any public official or employee or agent of a public authority who , other than in cases provided for by law , dissolves or suspends a legally constituted association , trade union , society or cooperative , or obstructs its legal activities , shall be liable to a prison sentence of between one and three years and suspended from his position or job for the same period .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
It was said that members could be elected or appointed for a limited period of time on a rotating basis , and they could serve either in an official or in a personal capacity , in particular indigenous representatives stated that the status of the representatives should be equal . 
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
ECA Regional Statistical Database ; Africa Live Database and five country Live Database ; bibliographic information data , including : ECA Library on-line catalogue ; databases of : official publications and primary sources ; ECA publications ; new acquisitions ; indexed , abstracted journals and periodicals ; economic , social , scientific and technical aspects on Africa ( bibliographic ) ; geo-information in Africa including GIS applications , mapping coverage and educational training facilities ;  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Her delegation supported the opinion expressed in paragraph 50 of the report of the Secretary-General that functions of supervision , regulation and of a policy nature should not be entrusted to gratis personnel , that they could not be assigned functions of a sensitive and confidential nature , and that they should not have signatory authority for official correspondence .  
It urges the Government of Colombia to intensify to the maximum political , administrative , judicial and other appropriate measures with respect to official bodies suspected of supporting ' paramilitary ' groups , including legal proceedings against any State agent who cooperates with the ' paramilitaries ' , measures to dismantle the structure of and links between so _ called ' Convivirs ' and ' paramilitary ' groups , and to bring their members to justice .  
The former CIA official stated in this article that the National Security Advisor , Samuel R . Berger , justified the action against the factory by claiming that the plant was part of the " Sudanese military industrial complex " , that it was heavily guarded , that it produced no medicines and that its ownership trail led to terrorist chief Osama bin Laden .

The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .

Staff members appointed under these Rules shall be entitled , within the limits and under the conditions established by the Secretary-General , to reasonable compensation in the event of loss or damage to their personal effects determined to be directly attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations .  
The dramatic , indefensible , shrinkage of official development aid is a deeply disturbing sign of a trend that could erode the moral foundation for the universal validity of central values . 
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
Activities in the Paris Club in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999 were marked by continued restructuring of the debts of the poorest countries in the context of the HIPC initiative ; the return of middle-income countries to reschedule their official bilateral debts ; and special measures taken in support of countries affected by conflict or natural disaster .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
Moreover , the Board ought to call on the international community to take urgent and practical measures to reverse the continued decline in the flow of official development assistance , which had fallen to less than one-third of the internationally agreed targets .  
Many formally independent countries were really in a state of dependence because of a growing burden of indebtedness , dwindling official development assistance , and the negative impact of globalization and market liberalization , all aggravated by the imposition of standard political , economic and social models that took no account of differences in identity , culture , degree of development and the like .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

The joint organization , by official and popular bodies , of national poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns for children under five years of age , regardless of their immunization status , accompanied by central and local public information campaigns coinciding with the arrival of the vaccine in each locality .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,

So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;  
At the open and public trial , televised nationwide , at which this claim was considered , it was clearly proved that the United States Government was directly responsible for this continued aggression , and that the undeclared war against Cuba had constituted an official State policy enforced by no fewer than nine successive United States Administrations over the last 40 years .  
The hostile policy of the United States towards Iraq , which runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , has been made clear in official statements by senior officials in the United States Administration that stress that the United States is determined to unseat the patriotic Government of Iraq and dismember its national unity .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
If official recognition has fundamental value for the future it is because it includes and creates a dynamic of peace that is vital in order to rise above the press of daily events haunted by an often murky past .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Despite the budgetary difficulties caused by the drop in official development assistance in the past few years , Spain has held its contribution to the Population Fund steady since 1995 and , bearing in mind the stimulus this special session has given the Cairo Programme of Action and the importance of the objectives we have set ourselves , Spain is studying the possibility of increasing its contribution to the Population Fund over the next few years .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
The importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes is reaffirmed .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .

HIC collaboration in the Habitat II process began since 1993 , and included participation in all of the Habitat II preparatory meetings , and in a very large number of other official United Nations and governmental , and international , regional and national civil society preparatory activities .  
HIC regional networks and committees organized their own Habitat II processes to contribute to the Conference ; the myriad of activities , projects , meetings , publications and other contributions of these civil society processes developed , managed and promoted by HIC and its members could not be listed within this brief space , which notes only some direct HIC contributions to the official process .  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
In Chile there is no law on binding divorce , but there is a special judicial agreement which declares a marriage null and void by declaring that the civil registry official who performed the marriage was incompetent ; this is possible with the agreement of both parties .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
Article 243 establishes that an official who tortures an accused person or resorts to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in order to make him confess his offence , shall be punished by heavy imprisonment for up to five years and shall be disqualified from the civil service either temporarily or for life .  
The Act was accompanied by a decree _ law establishing local boards ( 324 nationwide ) to administer the guaranteed minimum wage ; they are a key element in what is an example of good governance on poverty in the developed world , grounded in the reinforcement of the local mutual aid network by linking official administrators with community organizations .  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The Special Rapporteur was informed that under Hungarian law , a document can only be secret or non-public if it has been so classified through an official procedure by competent bodies or persons and authorized by statutory means , or if the publication of a particular document has been restricted by law .  
In the statement it issued on the occasion of General Ivachov ' s visit , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic indicated that the frank and unambiguous statements by the above-mentioned military official of the Russian Federation strengthened Azerbaijan ' s apprehension regarding the purpose of this new phase of political and military cooperation between Russia and Armenia , which had thus been lifted to a qualitatively different strategic level .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .  
The official United Nations demographic estimates and projections will be prepared for all countries and areas of the world , as well as urban and rural areas and major cities , and will serve as the standard and consistent set of population figures for use throughout the United Nations system . 
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
The owner further indicated that the invoices he had prepared pursuant to the Chiefs instructions contained both ( a ) charges for up to 100 kg of accompanied excess baggage , even though he knew that , under the terms of the special discounts provided by the airlines , the United Nations was exempted from the obligation to pay those charges and ( b ) inflated airfares for tickets for official travel by United Nations peacekeepers .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
The types of acts publishable under the Convention will include corrupt activities involving an international civil servant , a foreign public official , a judge or other official of an international court . 23 The importance of addressing organized crimes perpetration of and involvement in corruption is undisputed . 
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
Efforts are being made at the national level , yet , paradoxically , official development assistance is still decreasing , and the commitment made by rich countries to commit 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product is far from being fulfilled .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
Although official development finance ( ODF ) has risen from its level in 1996 , that increase of about $ 15-billion has not been sufficient to prevent a sharp drop in the total net resource flow to developing countries in 1998 .  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
While the Cologne debt initiative was a welcome step towards that goal , it must be accompanied by realistic , genuine debt relief measures such as the conversion into grants of any remaining official bilateral and multilateral debt .  
At the national level , poverty eradication was the official objective of the ninth fiveyear plan , which included decentralization , agricultural development and integrated agroforestry development .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
Financial regulatory authorities are usually well informed about the concerns of relevant business sectors , but interactions of official circles with civil society have generally been less intense in the area of international financial policy .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .  
Fourthly , official development assistance targets must be fulfilled , with special attention to the least developed countries and to effective implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative aimed at ensuring increased resources for social development .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
There was a need for financial investment , free access to markets , and improved external conditions for trade , financial and economic activities ; it was also imperative that such countries should benefit from additional official development assistance .  
The official response to calls by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights to stop the indiscriminate aerial bombardment left much to be desired , and such attacks must be considered as intolerable under international law .  
As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
The programme establishes legal rights with the aim of ensuring adequate working conditions : weekly days off , paid leave , paid official holidays , standard minimum wage , fair remuneration , benefits , maternity leave and notice of termination of contract .

During his official mission to South Africa in October 1997 , the Special Rapporteur pointed out that failure to sanction mercenary organizations and racist groups of the extreme right might well open the way for future terrorist attacks , and he now notes with concern that , during 2000 , 21 explosive devices were set off in Cape Town , as a result of which 3 persons were killed and 130 injured . 
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
The total savings of $ 2,836,500 with respect to contractual services , security services , medical treatment and services , claims and adjustment , medical supplies , sanitation and cleaning materials , subscription , operational maps and general stores were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $ 1,229,300 with respect to data-processing services , official hospitality , miscellaneous services , stationery and office supplies , electrical supplies and field defence stores .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Translating and revising documents , official correspondence and publications ; providing quality control of in-house and contractual translation ; providing reference and terminology services for translators , interpreters and editors , as well as for external contractors ; outsourcing translation , editing , proof-reading , typesetting , typing and other work ; providing assistance and feedback to contractors ; coordinating the quality-control system for outsourced jobs ; maintaining , updating and expanding the roster of individual and corporate contractors ; preparing contracts ; and providing the requisite administrative data ; ( b ) Editorial services . 
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 248 of 23 December 1999 , decided that , in the absence of an Assembly decision to the contrary , the use of remote interpretation should not constitute an alternative to the current institutionalized system of interpretation , and that the use of remote interpretation should not affect the quality of interpretation or in itself lead to any further reductions in language posts , nor should it affect the equal treatment of the six official languages .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .

But the analyst pointed out that this is the first time a very high senior official with the rank of vice premier of the State Council has talked specifically about the concrete content of the " one country , two systems " to be applied to Taiwan , and it has therefore attracted wide attention from overseas media .

He said this phenomenon should be improved as quickly as possible .  
As pointed out by a responsible official of the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee , press , publication , radio , television , and film industries should be committed to innovating the macro managerial mechanism , the micro structure , the market organization system , and the investment and financing systems , so that China can occupy an important position in the global media structure .

The Japanese prime minister 's brazenly paying his respects shows that Yakusuni Shrine is a symbol of aggressive war ; it has overtones of a public and official provocation , and indicates contempt for the people of those countries which suffered from that aggression .  It recalls for those people the pain they suffered , so is it not something natural , a matter of course , for the Chinese people to express their strong indignation and firm opposition ?  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?

A military official has commented that the new government may very likely be drawn into a scandal in future in the " underwater sonic detection system " cooperation program , just like the scandals surrounding the purchases of French Lafayette frigates that troubled the previous government .

Early this year , Hu Changqing , ex-deputy governor of Jiangxi Province , was sentenced to death for extensively taking and demanding large bribes , thereby becoming the highest ranking official sentenced to death for corruption in China since the 1960s .  
The " punishment " against those responsible persons by the US side was like a trifling matter .  It only dismissed an unnamed middle level official of the Central Intelligence Bureau , and the seven low-level working personnel only received punishments of not being promoted for two to three years .  
A responsible official from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People 's Congress [ NPC ] today commented here on the anti-China resolutions on Taiwan and Tibet adopted by the European Parliament [ EP ] .

"  
The perspective given to people from the meaning within the words was not so much wanting to show good intentions , but hinging on the elaborate style of the wording , seemed to show the new official Taiwan leadership is lacking sufficient understanding of the serious situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . The cunning application of wording was greater than that allotted to practical considerations , and the elaborate portion was greater than the revealing of sincere feelings .  
A relevant official of the Guangxi Regional Public Security Department said that in future , Guangxi will continue to resolutely and severely punish criminal acts of violating regulations on gun management , will not relax its work to seize illegal guns and ammunitions , will strive to confiscate all guns once they are discovered , and will go all out to eliminate the hidden danger to social order and ensure the people to live and work in peace and contentment .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
A responsible official of a relevant department in Fujian Province said on 22 June : The Fujian Provincial Government expressed deep regrets for the 58 alleged stowaways who suffocated in a container seated on a truck in Britain 's Dover port , and condemned the criminal act of international organized criminal syndicates .  
Commenting on reports by some mass media that the dead of the Dover tragedy came from Fujian , the responsible official said : The Fujian Provincial Government is paying very close attention to the case .  It has conducted a two-day house-to-house investigation in Fuqing and Changle where illegal emigration was rampant .  It has also decided and made preparations : When necessary , it will send a deputy secretary general of the Fujian Provincial Government and responsible officials from relevant departments to Britain to help identify the dead and deal with the aftermath of the Dover tragedy .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
People have also noticed that all the six countries Li Peng has visited have invariably reiterated that they support the principle of One China and hope to see China 's complete reunification be realized on an earlier date .  They have also made it clear that they will develop no official relations with Taiwan . This shows that the Chinese Government 's principle of safeguarding national reunification has been recognized by the international community at large .  
Chen Shui-bian calls the mainland 's struggle against " Taiwan independence " hegemonism , and has confused state sovereignty with human rights .  He has attempted to sow dissension among the compatriots in Taiwan , the international community , and the mainland , and publicly promoted official relations between Taiwan and the United States , in addition to meddling with the social and political affairs of the mainland .

Wang Yingfan noted that developed countries should further open their markets to developing countries , meet at the earliest possible date the target of raising their official development aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product , and fully and effectively solve the foreign-debt problem of developing countries .  
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is mutually beneficial .  Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .

The official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission pointed out that Wu Wenying , as a party leading cadre , made use of her powers to help a company get listed .  Her son purchased shares that were supposed to be sold only to staff members of the company and made huge profits .  Wu 's behavior has seriously damaged the cleanliness of party leading cadres in performing their duties and has violated party discipline .  
Besides , thanks to economic responsibility auditing , the leading cadres have cultivated a stronger sense of responsibility and a stronger sense of self-restriction and have grown more conscious in being strict with themselves while performing official duties and those who take over leading posts have also learned both experiences and lessons from their predecessors and have thus avoided making the same mistakes .

In addition , Xu received more than 10 million yuan in bribes .  The Jiangsu Provincial Procuratorate recently approved Xu 's arrest and charged him with an enormous amount of crimes that were especially serious and harmful to society .  
According to people in China 's legal circles , after the Central Committee on Discipline announced last month that Xu Qiyao was investigated and punished for " bribery and extreme debauchery , " a joint task force comprised of members from the Central Committee on Discipline and Jiangsu Provincial Organization on Inspecting Discipline quickly conducted an unannounced hearing on this typical case , which marked the first time since the government in China was established , where a provincial department-level official was charged with debauchery .

The high-ranking MND official pointed out : In recent months , the Chinese Communists have not engaged in any large-scale exercises along the coast , nor have there been unusual troop movements .

Our military has put in place defense and relevant security measures on the offshore islands .  Having inferred possible scenarios , the MND has concluded that there is no need to adjust the military strength on the offshore islands in the near future .  
The official said emphatically : Using simulated systems , our military long ago practiced ways of coping with possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops and came up with several contingency plans .  The US military provided relevant information and data specifically for this purpose .  It assisted Taiwan 's military in analyzing , through the application of the " net assessment " method , possible moves by the Chinese Communist troops for use as reference in contingency planning .

As for those cadres who have a poor ideological and political quality , especially those who are found to have abused power for personal gains and have failed to remain honest in performing their official duties , we must firmly refuse to use them .  
Two , we must give top priority to case investigation and make breakthroughs in some typical cases of violation of law and discipline , especially cases of trickery to defraud state investments , abuse of official position to engage in graft and corruption , abuse of official power to seek private gains , and cases where dereliction of duty have resulted in poor construction quality that leads to accidents and cases of corruption hidden behind substandard construction work and so on .  We must put a firm grip on these cases and thoroughly investigate them .

Although he has run up against counterattacks from polluting industries and is seen as wreaking havoc in the " political ecology , " he has for this very reason accumulated even greater political resources : constituent support .  
Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again ! " says Chuoshui Rural Township elected official Chang Yi-hsiung unhappily .  
Good wine goes deep , and the food and wine comes and goes until the fifth course , the main dish of vegetarian ingredients made up to look like roast suckling pig . The official in charge of roasting wields his knife , singing loud and clear with each cut : " One heart to protect the country , two for respect , three for a mountain of virtue . . . six for amiable compliance , eight for a festival of rejoicing . "  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
Even though they gave their lives in the air , since they never graduated , the monthly compensation afforded to their families is based on that of a sergeant , not an official pilot - - a mere NT $ 10,000 or so a month , only enough to reopen the wounds of grief of their aging parents . Air force pilots share a passion for flying , and they know that in making their dream come true they may eventually have to pay the ultimate price .  
At the end a scholar in official mandarin dress and a female character with a powdered face came out and bowed to each other and the audience , thanking them for watching . Only this counts as a full performance . After the evil spirits were expelled and thanks given to the gods , with easy hearts people returned to the normal order of their lives .  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
Riding into history : There is no singing or lyrics and no dialogue , only three to five roles , and a horse 's head and horse tail carried along by the " imperial examination candidate . " The puma company relates stories like that of the unrefined examination hopeful who keeps falling off his horse or of the crazy old official , an equally incompetent equestrian , going on an inspection tour .  
Come and meet the In-specting King ! " An evil visitor borne by the waves : Each year at the middle of the sixth lunar month Wen Wangyeh , the deity who resides in Yunglung Temple in Tainan , leads the local people out to receive the Inspecting King as this " high official " disembarks on his far-ranging round of inspection , followed by his retinue of abandoned souls .  
The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
The Han dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ) had an official charged with rearing the emperor 's hunting dogs , and in the Tang dynasty ( 618-9O7 ) there was even a special imperial kennels which raised hunting dogs for the emperor . Long ago , primitive men had dances imitating animals . The " dance of the hundred beasts " was not a performance using real animals as in a circus , but a religious ritual dance similar to the annual nuowu dances to drive out evil .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
As official agencies and renowned international economic think tanks release optimistic forecasts for 1995 , an American economist , Ravi Batra , has struck an independent note . As the title of his book The World Great Depression suggests , he predicts there will be a global economic disaster in 1995 .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala . In the earliest period of Taiwan history , it was said to be the hunting grounds of the Ketagalan and an official site for worshipping their ancestors .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Later , a corrupt official threatens to expose Shao 's mistaken identity . The intense exchange between the two captivates the audience . When there is a pause that lasts a minute or so , there is not the slightest sound on stage or off , with only the faint whirr of the air conditioning disturbing the silence .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
Yang Wen-I notes that the Biennale has always been an open-application exhibition . For instance , four years ago the motion artist Li Ming-shen applied as an individual . But this time the curators filed the application , and after careful consideration of the Biennale selection committee , it was accepted . Multiplication / Fragmentation is formally listed as part of the Biennale de Venezia 97 and is included in the show 's official catalog .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
As the president 's official photographer , Kao 's choice of angle when photographing him was tempered by the desire to maintain the national leader 's dignity . The pictures which political photojournalists love to take of politicians distressed or dispirited , yawning or picking their noses , are nowhere to be seen in Kao 's archives . " What 's the point of taking those ? When I did happen to get shots like that , I destroyed them , " says Kao .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
In the second year of the Jiaqing reign period ( 1796-1821 ) of the Qing , Hong Chaohe began publishing his Popular Almanac for Bringing Out [ Auspiciousness ] and Avoiding [ Misfortune ] . The almanac showed outstanding calculating capability , being comparable to the official version , published shortly after Hong 's , in defining the traditional 24 " solar periods " ( climatic stages of the year ) . Hong 's work was very well-received .  
Tsai Jui-yueh , a quiet and cultured native of the old city of Tainan , ignored these criticisms . Resolutely maintaining her position , she headed north to Taipei the next year , and in the City Hall put on " The First Exhibition of Tsai Jui-yueh 's Creative Dance " accompanied by the official provincial orchestra . The performance was an eye-opener for the many who had never seen a dance performance before .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
The venerable history of weiqi can be traced to the Zhou dynasty ( 1122-255 BC ) . Over the following centuries it was mentioned in many verses , songs , and popular stories . Given the official endorsement by Confucius , and its immense popularity among the literati of the Han , Wei , and Six Dynasties , it gained a reputation as an activity suitable for refined persons , and it maintained an elegant image .  
In 1553 , during the Ming dynasty , after a Portuguese " tribute ship " was blown aground , the Portuguese captain asked to lease a nearby fishing village to dry out the goods . A local maritime official acceded to the request . In 1614 , after the Portuguese had assisted the Ming court in defeating pirates , Viceroy Zhang Ming-gang secured the emperor 's consent to allow Portuguese to settle permanently in Macau .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
Given that education was run by and for government bureaucrats , those who studied did so only in order to further their ambitions and become officials . They cared little for knowledge or morality , or for the intrinsic value of learning . Philosophers realized that education and teaching materials lacked vitality and in fact limited people 's development in various ways . In order to escape the rigid and lifeless official education system , private education began to flourish .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
On August 21 , the task force announced that Yin 's murder had been planned out in advance by persons who were currently active in the military service . One was Captain Chen Lu-tseng , chief of staff for former Navy Commander-in-Chief Chuang Ming-yao . Another was a high-ranking military official whose identity is too sensitive to reveal .  
The innkeeper could only shake his head and watch as Wu wobbled off up the road . After a while Wu passed an official notice warning about the tiger , and realized that the innkeeper had spoken the truth . He considered turning round but then thought better of it , worried that he 'd look stupid if he went back to the inn .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks . He would often be awakened by phone calls in the middle of the night-having just got to sleep after yet another busy day . His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
( AFP , Washington ) Citing the confidential assessment report from the Pentagon , a US defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between India and Pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12-million .  That figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .  
official statistics reported that inflation in the first quarter was running at a monthly rate of 6 4 percent as compared with the previous same period , further lowering romanians ' living standard  
a chinese foreign ministry official said li and rabuka exchanged views on bilateral relations , the international and regional situations and other issues of common concern  
according to an official from the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic co operation , the aim of the project , the memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992 , is to assist china in mitigating environmental degradation caused by the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable technology from australia  
Bearing in mind that official statistical information is an essential basis for sustainable development in the economic , demographic , social and environmental fields and for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of the world ,  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
Four additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1316 ) .  
Establishment of formal , official and effective public service rules and regulations and a contingent of public servants qualified , capable and skilled in the management of the public administration system in new stages of development ;  
There are complex cases in which allegations of mercenary activities in domestic conflicts are reported by international press sources and specialized analysts , but are denied or met with a dogged silence when information is sought from official sources .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
Two additional manuals , one on public and official use for civil registration and vital statistics records and another on population , education and communication for civil registration , are being planned and are expected to be completed in 1996 .  
Equally satisfying in our opinion is the compromise solution reached after long discussion , namely to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly a single compendium including the valuable joint assessment , prepared by the two Vice-Chairmen in their personal capacity , of the two rolling papers on clusters 1 and 2 , as well as proposals and contributions presented by individual countries and groups of countries .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
In our view , a speedy recovery from the critical situation of depleting resources requires , first and foremost , that the developed countries honour their political commitments by increasing substantially their contributions to resources on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , especially their official development assistance . 
In the light of the urgency of the need to find timely and effective approaches for addressing the issue , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria , Greece , Moldova , Romania and Ukraine came forward with a set of specific proposals in a joint letter to the Secretary-General of 18 May 1995 , circulated as an official United Nations document ( A / 50 / 189 ) .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
However , factors of history and constraints imposed by the external economic environment in particular , reduced official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , worsening terms of trade and increased barriers hindering access to markets in the developed countries have prevented any fundamental improvement in their economic situation .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
The travel costs of military and civilian personnel to the mission area on assignment , rotation or repatriation have been estimated at an average of $ 2,000 per person one way , or $ 4,000 round trip ( basic air fare of $ 1,000 , plus 100 kilogrammes of unaccompanied baggage and travel allowances at $ 1,000 ) .  The cost of a round-trip travel on a three-day official mission to New York is estimated at $ 1,400 ( $ 700 basic airfare and $ 700 in allowances and daily subsistence allowance ) .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
With regard to this recommendation , it was clarified that JIU recommended not the establishment of a new post but the designation of " a competent senior official with extensive managerial experience , who will be a focal point and held accountable for the firm implementation of the current restructuring process " .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
Section III of the IAEA 's seventh semi-annual report ( document S / 1995 / 287 dated 11 April 1995 ) on the implementation of the IAEA 's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq 's compliance with the relevant obligations specified in UNSC resolutions 687 ( 1991 ) and 715 ( 1991 ) , addressed the implications of two , single page , documents which were represented as official Iraqi correspondence , generated in April / May 1994 , suggesting the reconstitution of a nuclear weapons programme .  
UNHCR responded that it was unable to associate itself with that action , explaining that the registration of spontaneous returnees was directly linked with , and complementary to , the simultaneous official voluntary repatriation process under the terms of the quadripartite agreement . 
Furthermore , the practice of organizing a small group into an official unit complete with a unit chief requires careful consideration given the status associated with " bosses " , and the potential for " mini " bureaucracies to develop .  19 .  In terms of specific findings relating to these small units , electronic data-processing personnel were found to have been scattered across the Division in one or two units within each Service .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
These included two introductory posters , published in 1990 and 1991 , and a major campaign poster in the six official languages , published in 1992 ; a press kit , three public television announcements and two documentary films on single-parent families and on the family and ageing , produced by the Department of Public Information ; a regularly updated calendar of events related to the Year ; stickers on the Year and the International Day of Families .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
Turning to the report on the sources of finance for development at mid-decade ( A / 50 / 397 ) , he noted that the marked increases in private resource flows to Asia and Latin America , which had far exceeded official flows , reflected successful economic reforms and strengthened political confidence in those regions .  
Despite all the efforts of the international community , particularly the Paris Club and development partners such as France , Germany , Japan , the United States of America , Denmark and Canada , to alleviate the debt burden and cancel part of the bilateral official debt , the least developed countries continued to experience a falling standard of living .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
At the polling stations , voters were to present to the referendum administrators , in the presence of various Iraqi security forces and Baath Party officials , the first part of the ballot card together with official papers verifying their identity and eligibility , whereupon voters were directed to complete the second part of the card in a separate booth and then to place their completed ballots into an opaque sealed box .  
In the light of this and against the backdrop of the current climate of budgetary stringency and scarcity of official development assistance , two major policy issues have been identified : ( a ) how to improve aid allocations to the least developed countries ; and ( b ) how to enhance the quality and effectiveness of assistance .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
At a time when most third-world countries are facing enormous challenges that hamper their advance towards greater progress and prosperity , and while our planet is facing environmental challenges that threaten the future of all life on Earth , considerable resources are being devoted to the production , refinement and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction of all kinds , while official development assistance continues to decline .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
Indeed , 72 per cent of single heads of households , most of them female , live below the official poverty line , which simply implies a lack of access or limited access to basic social services , including food , sanitation , shelter , basic education and primary health care . 
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
It recognizes the efforts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to incorporate social development into their policies and programmes in a variety of ways and more intensively than in the past , as well as the urgent need for the international community to make efforts to reach as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance .  It also endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 , on new and innovative ideas to generate new funds .  
In addition , the problems of persistent poverty , increasing unemployment , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , environmental degradation , drug abuse and drug trafficking , crime , terrorism and social disintegration have combined to present a formidable array of challenges , which , if left unaddressed , threaten to overwhelm us and further marginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us . 
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and increase the share of funding for social development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Though aware of the precarious security situation and the poor condition of the infrastructure in Goma and the consequent need for official government assistance , the Commission considered that the insistence of Zairian officials on attending all its interviews was obstructive , unhelpful and not in keeping with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1013 ( 1995 ) , and especially paragraphs 5 ( a ) and ( e ) thereof . 
In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
Achieving the agreed targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance , and 0.15 per cent of gross national product for assistance to the least developed countries , as soon as possible , and not later than the year 2000 , and increasing the share of funding for adequate shelter and human settlement development programmes , commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Habitat Agenda ;

Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure , from within existing resources , that the revision of the United Nations Manual on Human Rights Reporting is completed as soon as possible , that the revised manual is available in all official languages at the earliest opportunity and that due regard is paid to the recommendations concerning the manual made by the fifth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies ;  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
Article 5 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that no law enforcement official may inflict , instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war , a threat to national security , international political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
36 Panama reported on legislative amendments to its Penal Code , dealing , inter alia , with the criminalization and penalization of physical or psychological aggression , violence and intimidation , corruption of minors and indecent assault , incest and the commission or knowledge of an act of domestic violence by a public or private official , as well as the failure to inform the proper authorities of such an act .  
The policies announced by the Government included a halt to the printing of money , a reduction in the excessive amounts of money in circulation , increases in the charges on government-provided goods and services , the sale of some government assets , and a relaxation of the restrictions on foreign exchange trading by allowing official exchange houses to trade at rates comparable with those available on the parallel market , as well as by allowing Iraqis living abroad to transfer funds to their relatives in Iraq .  
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
As an official and categorical denial of the shameless accusations that have been made against the Burundian army , which certain circles have all too gratuitously and tendentiously blamed for the recent deaths in Cibitoke province , the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that , on the contrary , the forces of order have rescued many other citizens threatened by armed terrorist groups that have infiltrated into Burundi from abroad .  
They shall also be granted reasonable official time to prepare for and attend meetings of related bodies , to represent staff in joint advisory bodies and to conduct their representational activities ( such as meetings with supervisors or managers ) , provided that the proportion of the official time spent on representational activities should not be unreasonable in relation to their performance of assigned duties ;

Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .

Countries to contribute to periodic forest resources assessments by ( i ) nominating a focal point for cooperation with the FRA secretariats and ( ii ) providing , on a continuing basis , the information needed for the regional and global forest resources assessments , irrespective of whether it originates from official or unofficial ( expert estimates ) sources ;  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .

Since the question of financing of technical cooperation activities supported by OIC and its subsidiary bodies is of crucial importance , particularly in view of diminishing international resources for official development assistance , the Islamic Development Bank and other funding institutions in the Islamic world should participate in periodic consultations between the United Nations and OIC . 
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .

Torture , which is an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , is defined in article 1 of the Declaration as follows : " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons " .  
When engaged in a scientific activity abroad a researcher is subject to the " official mission " schedule , which accords him a privileged status and allowances which are dependent on his grade but , in any event , sufficient to cover the costs of his stay abroad and , if necessary , of registration fees and travel .  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
The integrity of the statistical institution ( i.e . , whether it operated under a published statistical law and independently of political interference ) , the transparency of the statistical production and dissemination process , and public and equal access to information were three important concerns for winning the trust of users in official economic statistics .  
Although some participants stressed the need to respond in a flexible manner to the demand for economic information for decision-making , including forecasting , others raised the potential conflict of interest in national statistical offices , first making projections and then publishing official statistics that either corroborated or invalidated their own projections .

It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?

Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
enslaved national minorities such as the African _ Americans , Afro _ Brazilians , Dalits , etc . who suffer acute and persistent inequalities due to centuries of gross violation of their human rights through official State policies of enslavement , segregation , and attempted forced assimilation into the bottom levels or underclass of the dominant majority . 
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
We welcome you as a high-ranking official and a professional of established authority , as well as a representative of Ukraine , a country with which Belarus maintains close and friendly relations and which is making a valuable contribution to international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations .  
The Ethnic Groups Act contains detailed regulations concerning the use of minority languages in official communications with federal , provincial and local authorities , including administrative authorities and courts , and they may also be used in appellate proceedings in superior courts .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Replace the existing text with the following : 3 .  To re-examining , with a view to denying it in countries which do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes , paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a member State to any public official of another country , in accordance with the basic principles of its legal order ;  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;

In the light of various publications in the media and elsewhere concerning Israel 's interrogation policies and practices , I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the attached paper * on the subject ( prepared by the Ministry of Justice ) distributed as an official document of the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , before its opening on 10 March 1997 . 
The international community and international organizations were requested to support national initiatives and implementation of the targets set in the Platform for Action , including the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 . 
Both recurrent and non-recurrent statistical publications of the Statistics Division are distributed , free of charge , to permanent missions , foreign ministries and other official recipients on mailing lists maintained by the Office of Conference Services of the Secretariat and to national and international statistical offices and United Nations agencies and others who assist the Division in data collection or analysis , on mailing lists maintained by the Division .  
The serious consequences of the sanctions and the embargo imposed on Iraq have aroused widespread international concern in official , political , legal and civic circles .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
The most desirable alternative would be to maintain the previously existing advantageous parking arrangements for diplomats performing their official duties , and to give them the appropriate legal and organizational status , for example by making the necessary additions to local legislative or other texts and issuing for diplomats ' vehicles special parking permits along the lines of those issued to State and City officials in New York .  
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
As at 13 June , the cumulative total of arms and ammunition recovered and verified by military observers was 10,036 weapons and more than 1.24-million assorted pieces of ammunition , while approximately 3,750 weapons had been reported surrendered to ECOMOG outside the official disarmament sites .  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
The Fund is a strong advocate of the 20 / 20 initiative , which is aimed at mobilizing the additional resources needed from the national budget and official development assistance to achieve the internationally agreed social goals adopted at the World Summit for Social Development and other international conferences convened during the first half of the 1990s .  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
All of this madness has revived official and covert operations , mercenaries , spies and assassins , as ready now as in the worst days of the cold war to plot and unleash terror against human beings and even employ aggressive biological agents against our economy .  
These are aggravated by , inter alia : stifling external indebtedness ; a continued deterioration of the terms of trade ; an alarming decline in official development assistance ; and an equally worrying reduction of international cooperation for development in general .  
Unless the developed countries fulfil their commitment to reach the United Nations accepted target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and intensify their efforts to reverse the present downward trend , hopes for the least developed countries will remain as grim as ever .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
Informal , democratic , transparent , universal , open and announced negotiations held in this official Headquarters with technical services can not be replaced by other forms of negotiations which , in lacking these elements , could only be considered complementary to them , if even that .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Heavier penalties may be applied under other statutes for acquiring a passport or another travel document in an unlawful manner by providing false information or intentionally concealing facts or contributing to incorrect information on official documents ; acquiring more than one passport or travel document for an unlawful purpose ; altering or removing parts of official travel documents for an unlawful purpose ; entering or exiting the country without reporting to passport control authorities ; or taking part in the concealment of a foreign national .  
To deny , in countries that do not already do so , the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and , to that end , to examine their respective modalities for doing so ;  
Governments and international organizations should apply , as soon as possible , the 20 / 20 concept and the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance , as accepted at the World Summit for Social Development and reinforced in the Platform for Action in a gender-balanced way .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;

Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
If it is committed by any State body or official , acting within its / his authority or ultra vires , it is considered to be an act by the State ( regardless whether it is suitable for discussion at the international level ) . 
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
The official results of the elections were announced on 30 April 1997 and confirmed by the Electoral Appeals Commission , which reported that most complaints received were addressed by the special measures adopted by the Transitional Administrator on election day , or dismissed after due consideration . 
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Furthermore , the report of the Secretary _ General stressed , in paragraph 23 , the persistent violation of the Israeli occupation authorities of the principles of international law , concerning administrative detention of Palestinians and the ill _ treatment and torture to which Palestinians are subjected , in accordance with an official decision made by the High Court and the Government of Israel , in addition to imposing collective punishments on Palestinians , among which is the demolition of houses in Jerusalem and in other regions of the occupied territory .  
I hereby kindly request you to consider this memorandum as an official document , and to distribute it as such to the distinguished members of the forty _ ninth session of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , currently being held in Geneva , as well as to the members of the upcoming fifty _ fourth session of the Commission on Human Rights under item 4 of its provisional agenda .  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .

The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
On a collective basis , symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation , such as formal public recognition by the State of its responsibility , or official declarations aimed at restoring victims ' dignity , commemorative ceremonies , naming of public thoroughfares or the erection of monuments , help to discharge the duty of remembrance .  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .

The Principles also provide that persons alleged to have committed these grave human rights violations should be suspended from any official duties during the investigation and removed from any position of control or power , whether direct or indirect .  
We need maximum official development assistance at the required international level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to aid us in our war against illegal drugs .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the developed countries gross national product to official development assistance , which had been considered the absolute minimum two decades previously , now looked like an unattainable dream .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
The fact that an act of corruption of a public official has been committed within the sphere of operations of the organized criminal group to facilitate its unlawful activities shall be regarded as a specific aggravating circumstance .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
The decisions of the Constitutional Court clearly show that , in the Colombian legal system , military jurisdiction is of a special and exceptional nature and may handle the offences committed only when the punishable acts have a clear _ cut , close and direct link with official duties .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Any public official or employee or agent of a public authority who , other than in cases provided for by law , dissolves or suspends a legally constituted association , trade union , society or cooperative , or obstructs its legal activities , shall be liable to a prison sentence of between one and three years and suspended from his position or job for the same period .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
It was said that members could be elected or appointed for a limited period of time on a rotating basis , and they could serve either in an official or in a personal capacity , in particular indigenous representatives stated that the status of the representatives should be equal .

ECA Regional Statistical Database ; Africa Live Database and five country Live Database ; bibliographic information data , including : ECA Library on-line catalogue ; databases of : official publications and primary sources ; ECA publications ; new acquisitions ; indexed , abstracted journals and periodicals ; economic , social , scientific and technical aspects on Africa ( bibliographic ) ; geo-information in Africa including GIS applications , mapping coverage and educational training facilities ;  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Instead of improving on the relatively weak performance in 1997 , gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Eastern Europe rose on average by just 2 per cent , less than half the rate implied by the official forecasts and nearly a percentage point lower than in 1997 ( see table 2 ) .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,

The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
Noting the widespread concern about the revelations , confirmed by judicial decisions and by statements of the current Administration of the Territory , that for decades there has been a systematic practice of discrimination and official persecution directed against tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who support independence , in flagrant violation of their civil and political rights ,

Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .

Staff members appointed under these Rules shall be entitled , within the limits and under the conditions established by the Secretary-General , to reasonable compensation in the event of loss or damage to their personal effects determined to be directly attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations .  
The dramatic , indefensible , shrinkage of official development aid is a deeply disturbing sign of a trend that could erode the moral foundation for the universal validity of central values . 
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
This cooperation is not confined to official endeavours undertaken by the Kuwaiti Government ; the State is also encouraging national institutions and individuals to provide aid and assistance to those in need thereof in other countries , regardless of the origin or cause of that need which might be attributable to poverty , natural disasters , human conflicts or other causes of human suffering which the State of Kuwait is endeavouring to combat and alleviate .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
Activities in the Paris Club in the second half of 1998 and the first half of 1999 were marked by continued restructuring of the debts of the poorest countries in the context of the HIPC initiative ; the return of middle-income countries to reschedule their official bilateral debts ; and special measures taken in support of countries affected by conflict or natural disaster .  
We also urge the developed countries and regional and international development institutions to provide assistance , grants and loans official and unofficial to African countries and to cancel their external debts , especially those of the poorest countries , to help them improve their economic , social and human capacities .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
Moreover , the Board ought to call on the international community to take urgent and practical measures to reverse the continued decline in the flow of official development assistance , which had fallen to less than one-third of the internationally agreed targets .  
Many formally independent countries were really in a state of dependence because of a growing burden of indebtedness , dwindling official development assistance , and the negative impact of globalization and market liberalization , all aggravated by the imposition of standard political , economic and social models that took no account of differences in identity , culture , degree of development and the like .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .

Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

So , references to wider macroeconomic concerns , i.e . debt relief and calls for increased official development assistance ( ODA ) levels by developed countries should be balanced by acknowledgement of the primary duty of all States to provide the conditions for the realization of the right to development , via good governance and the effective use of existing resources .  
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,

It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Need to tackle , where appropriate , bilateral , official , multilateral and private debt ( criteria for assessing extent of debt relief ) ; special issues of least developed countries Africa heavily indebted poor countries ; debt relief to provide lasting exit from debt problems , forgiving aid-related bilateral debt for least developed countries , need to improve creditworthiness , and the reduction of spreads in new lending ) ;

The hostile policy of the United States towards Iraq , which runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , has been made clear in official statements by senior officials in the United States Administration that stress that the United States is determined to unseat the patriotic Government of Iraq and dismember its national unity .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
The call for the mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral resources for social development and the commitment to achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance falls within the declared and unrealized commitments of the Copenhagen Summit .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
If official recognition has fundamental value for the future it is because it includes and creates a dynamic of peace that is vital in order to rise above the press of daily events haunted by an often murky past .

Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .

The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,

While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
Although official development finance ( ODF ) has risen from its level in 1996 , that increase of about $ 15-billion has not been sufficient to prevent a sharp drop in the total net resource flow to developing countries in 1998 .  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
While the Cologne debt initiative was a welcome step towards that goal , it must be accompanied by realistic , genuine debt relief measures such as the conversion into grants of any remaining official bilateral and multilateral debt .  
At the national level , poverty eradication was the official objective of the ninth fiveyear plan , which included decentralization , agricultural development and integrated agroforestry development .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
Financial regulatory authorities are usually well informed about the concerns of relevant business sectors , but interactions of official circles with civil society have generally been less intense in the area of international financial policy .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .  
Fourthly , official development assistance targets must be fulfilled , with special attention to the least developed countries and to effective implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative aimed at ensuring increased resources for social development .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
There was a need for financial investment , free access to markets , and improved external conditions for trade , financial and economic activities ; it was also imperative that such countries should benefit from additional official development assistance .  
The official response to calls by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights to stop the indiscriminate aerial bombardment left much to be desired , and such attacks must be considered as intolerable under international law .  
As one member of the Commission had stated , paragraph 2 in its current form was too broad and left the door open for any junior official to formulate a unilateral act that would more than likely be invalidated subsequently .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
The programme establishes legal rights with the aim of ensuring adequate working conditions : weekly days off , paid leave , paid official holidays , standard minimum wage , fair remuneration , benefits , maternity leave and notice of termination of contract .  
To further assist in fighting international organized crime , I am pleased to inform the Council that the official inauguration of the Sarajevo national Interpol office , established with considerable UNMIBH assistance , will take place next week .  
Staff members appointed under these Rules shall be entitled , within the limits and under the conditions established by the Secretary-General , to reasonable compensation in the event of loss or damage to their personal effects determined to be directly attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations .  
During his official mission to South Africa in October 1997 , the Special Rapporteur pointed out that failure to sanction mercenary organizations and racist groups of the extreme right might well open the way for future terrorist attacks , and he now notes with concern that , during 2000 , 21 explosive devices were set off in Cape Town , as a result of which 3 persons were killed and 130 injured . 
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
The net additional requirements of $ 900 under this heading were attributable to additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance ( $ 354,200 ) and other official travel costs ( $ 435,100 ) , as well as to unforeseen expenditure under the consultants budget line item ( $ 74,400 ) , offset by savings under the international and local staff salaries ( $ 104,700 and $ 171,500 , respectively ) and common staff costs ( $ 589,000 ) .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
The total savings of $ 2,836,500 with respect to contractual services , security services , medical treatment and services , claims and adjustment , medical supplies , sanitation and cleaning materials , subscription , operational maps and general stores were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $ 1,229,300 with respect to data-processing services , official hospitality , miscellaneous services , stationery and office supplies , electrical supplies and field defence stores .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Translating and revising documents , official correspondence and publications ; providing quality control of in-house and contractual translation ; providing reference and terminology services for translators , interpreters and editors , as well as for external contractors ; outsourcing translation , editing , proof-reading , typesetting , typing and other work ; providing assistance and feedback to contractors ; coordinating the quality-control system for outsourced jobs ; maintaining , updating and expanding the roster of individual and corporate contractors ; preparing contracts ; and providing the requisite administrative data ; ( b ) Editorial services . 
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Breaking the vicious circle of low growth and poverty requires inter alia a sustained injection of external financing in amounts large enough ( double the current flows of official development assistance ( ODA ) ) to give a major push to the region to accelerate and maintain growth at levels higher than in the past and thereby reduce aid dependency in the future .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 248 of 23 December 1999 , decided that , in the absence of an Assembly decision to the contrary , the use of remote interpretation should not constitute an alternative to the current institutionalized system of interpretation , and that the use of remote interpretation should not affect the quality of interpretation or in itself lead to any further reductions in language posts , nor should it affect the equal treatment of the six official languages .  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
Thus the weighted average of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita ( estimated at current official exchange rates ) is estimated to be $ 0.65 per day for the total population in African LDCs and $ 0.88 per day in Asian LDCs in the late 1990s , whilst in PPP terms ( in 1985 international prices ) it is estimated to be $ 1.51 per day in African LDCs and $ 4.59 per day in Asian LDCs .  
While it may be of excellent quality for other language professions for which there is a strong demand , that training appears to be in some respects ill-suited to the special and stringent requirements of the United Nations and of other international organizations for multilingual staff proficient in their specific official languages .  
Participants affirmed their commitment to providing the full financing and speedy and effective implementation of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) Initiative , which is essential for freeing domestic budgetary resources for poverty reduction , and they undertook to make expeditious progress towards full cancellation of outstanding official bilateral debt within the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative . 15 .  The Framework for Partnership ( A / CONF . 191 / 11 , chap .  
In our view , the Conference on Disarmament is a precious resource because , even in its current situation , it offers more space than any other forum for official multilateral dialogue on issues of concern .  Yet , questions are raised - for example , is the Conference on Disarmament a creature of the international security environment that awakes from its enforced hibernation only when there is adequate change in that environment ?  
The provision of $ 1,649,200 would provide for specialized contractual security training and the production of publications considered essential for the success of functioning of the new security management system , including : ( a ) requirements of $ 1,270,000 for security , emergency , stress management and other specialized training to be organized through specific seminars and courses , including the preparation of related training material , and ( b ) requirements of $ 379,200 for production of the Security Handbook in all official languages and the periodic reprinting of various updated security materials .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
This campaign , which is being conducted in grave and flagrant violation of signed commitments reached between Israel and the Palestinian leadership , and which represents a dangerous departure from the spirit and the letter of the Middle East peace process , is the direct result of the relentless incitement in the official Palestinian media , the collusion between the Palestinian leadership and recognized terrorist groups , and the release of scores of terrorists from Palestinian prisons . 
While heightened global concern about terrorism had raised critical issues which were being evaluated and about which decisions were being taken at the highest policy-making levels and official investigations were undertaken , an international coalition was formed with the declared objective of combating terrorism .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;
