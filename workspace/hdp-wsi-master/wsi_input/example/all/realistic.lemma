The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .  Not only the speech has realistic guiding significance on carrying out the Party 's educational policy in an all-round way and carrying forward our country 's education reform and development , but also will create profound historical influence .  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .

Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
Every enterprise is required to carry out the activity in the light of its own realistic conditions , draw up practical and workable measures for the improvement of its management , strive for marked breakthroughs in the aspect of improving its weak links , and ensure that its management can scale a new height this year .

The college conforms to its motto of " dedication , strictness , struggling for might , and being realistic " and creatively promotes education using the name of the " blue Project " , with its theme of loving battleships , loving islands and loving the sea .

Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .

As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .

Because the " Red Army " and the " Blue Army " compete with each other without knowing the other side 's manpower deployment , battle approaches , and tactical motives , their tactical training has therefore altered from a unilateral combined training to a realistic actual-troops confrontation , thus changing the mode of our military 's exercise , in which the " Red Army " used to win every battle .

Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
In these photographs Huang 's purpose is to record in brilliant color the special character of the cultures in the fast-changing remote areas on the island .

I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint .

But after 30 years as an ambassador I 've come to one conclusion about international relations : exhortations to another country about shared feelings , morality , and fighting the common enemy , while not completely useless , are certainly limited in effect ; what 's needed is a relationship of shared interests built on a realistic basis .  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
In these photographs Huang 's purpose is to record in brilliant color the special character of the cultures in the fast-changing remote areas on the island . By employing , as he says , " the human touch , " he is able to capture the naturalness , warmth , and ingenuousness of his subjects . In shooting them , he adheres to a traditional , classical style of realistic photography .  
From the simple , realistic black-and-white shots of his early years through the lyrical and humorous sketches of his later period right up to his warm , affectionate color portraits of the past two years , Ts'ai 's works confirm him as a powerful and truthful realistic observer .

Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential .

I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds .

The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint . But this would not be realistic enough , and after some time the paint would begin to flake off .

He then polished them to create an effect which really does look completely like bronze .

Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors .

" Lin feels that the popularity of such works is natural , since both the authors and readers are everyday people .

The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The World Summit on Sustainable Development would give the international community a unique opportunity to undertake a holistic and realistic assessment of the real challenges in the field of sustainable development and devise effective means to meet those challenges .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .
