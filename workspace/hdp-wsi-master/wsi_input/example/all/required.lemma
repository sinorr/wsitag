The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint . But this would not be realistic enough , and after some time the paint would begin to flake off .

He then polished them to create an effect which really does look completely like bronze .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Every part of a drama depends on coordinated staging , lighting , and costumes ; as well as on specialized input from the producer , art director , director , and musical director .

Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
Iraq 's cooperation , including the provision of accurate information and supporting documentation , access to personnel involved in the relevant activities and support of the Commission 's inspection and monitoring efforts will be required , on a continuous basis , in order to enable the Commission to achieve this objective in a speedy and efficient manner .  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .

Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .  
The raw images collected by optical sensors on board the satellites were corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions , in order to facilitate subsequent visual image interpretation or computer classification and to assure that they could be superposed on pre-existing maps as required , for example , in a GIS .  
experience over the past four years , he has received from the JAB advice of uneven quality , which was not readily acceptable and required in each case an in-depth review to determine whether each recommendation was supported by the evidence and conformed to the relevant legal principles , rules and policies .

Jamaica , therefore , supported recommendation 6 of the Secretary-General 's report ( A / 50 / 202 ) which called for the re-energizing of negotiations on a new , improved funding system in accordance with resolution 48 / 162 , which had called for a substantial increase in funding required for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis . 
The gradual economic reform which the transition to a market economy required was having adverse repercussions on the population 's standard of living and particularly on the most vulnerable sectors such as the disabled , elderly persons and young people .

Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .

Governments bore the primary responsibility for formulating appropriate strategies , policies , programmes and actions to combat poverty ; the effort required sound macroeconomic policies , structural changes and the mobilization of domestic resources , inter alia , through more equitable tax regimes and a reduction in military expenditures .  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .

resident coordinators ' annual reports , now more regular and substantive , would , in the future , be reviewed in the light of the various organizations ' concerns , and the coordinators had greater power in that all programmes required their final clearance .  
order to be effective , the operational activities required a continuous , predictable and assured flow of funds especially towards the least developed countries which were in a desperate economic situation .  
All those activities required financial support on an orderly , stable and predictable basis , and it was therefore critical that donor countries demonstrate the political commitment to provide the funds promised and thereby to reach the objectives established during the triennial review . 
Although resident coordinators had a key role to play , they should be assisted by ensuring that the local representatives of other entities engaged in operational activities consulted them regarding the implementation of major programmes and by authorizing the resident coordinators to propose to the heads of those entities the amendment of country programmes and major projects , where required , to bring them into line with the country strategy note , in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 .

of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;

Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
Under no circumstances would it be politically justifiable not to promote corrective measures in all areas or to move the United Nations , at an appropriate way , closer to the effective promotion of an alternative model of development so as to ensure compatibility between the required social changes and the current opening up of our economies .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
It is estimated in the New Agenda that a minimum of $ 30-billion in official development assistance was required in 1992 to achieve an average annual growth rate of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent in African countries over the course of the 1990s .

Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .

Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year .

What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .

It stated that the prevention of financial crises required enhanced early warning mechanisms , including improved and effective surveillance of national and international financial market developments .  
The State and conflicting parties are required to adhere to the humanitarian imperative and facilitate safe and easy access to endangered populations and affected areas for rapid provision of humanitarian assistance ;  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
A long-standing request for an additional airport permit , required to collect the diplomatic pouch , was granted to an international driver during the reporting period , bringing the total of such permits held to two .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
The Administration has reviewed its plans and projected expenditures as reflected in the tenth progress report , and has concluded that they appear to be accurate and the maximum level of assistance that will be required from the main contractor during the transition period and from other contractors for the development of reports will remain within the estimates .  
The vast majority of the backlog of claims for contingent-owned equipment has now been reviewed , with the initial calculations having been forwarded to the relevant permanent missions for concurrence ; certification of these claims is delayed only when troop contributors are not in agreement with the Secretariats calculations , or the required supporting documentation is not received in a timely manner .  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
An anti-corruption programme had been established within the Russian Federation , and a legislative act entitled Fighting corruption , which required all public officials to provide information on their income , assets , securities and bank deposits , including those held abroad , was in the final stages of preparation . 
Such assessments require a political grasp of the clash of parties , values and interests in the mission area , as well as a solid military , logistical and administrative understanding of the risks , costs and means required for operational effectiveness .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
Where specific legislation is required in order for the contracting authority to carry out certain types of projects , the relevant statute often sets forth the conditions for the operation and maintenance of the relevant infrastructure facilities and is supplemented by more detailed provisions in regulations governing that particular infrastructure sector and in the project agreement , an approach that is common to various legal systems .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
The social , economic and environmental challenges extended far beyond the capacity of individual countries and required a global effort to protect the earths ecosystem and to promote social development and economic growth in a manner which would also preserve natural resources . 
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
Each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect , promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms , inter alia , by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social , economic , political and other fields , as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction , individually and in association with others , are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice .  
In accordance with its mandate , the Mission is required to verify both that due process is observed and that the competent national bodies carry out such investigations as may be required in an independent and effective manner , in accordance with the Constitution and with international human rights norms .  
An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .  
Solving that global problem , which affected adoptive parents abroad as well as the institutions and legal systems of the babies countries of origin , required adopting the Special Rapporteurs recommendation that international and regional registers of adopted children should be established worldwide .  
The full amount of the advance is maintained in the accounts receivable from staff members until such time as the staff member produces the required proof of entitlement to the education grant , at which time the budgetary account is charged and the advance recovered .  
While the question of poverty must be dealt with primarily as a violation of human rights and of the right to development , the measures to be taken for its eradication required integrated approaches encompassing its economic , social , cultural , educational , demographic and other dimensions .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .  
$ 253,600 for general temporary assistance required for the temporary replacement of staff on extended sick leave or maternity leave ; temporary assistance during periods of peak workload due mainly to finalization of the convention against transnational organized crime and three additional international legal instruments ; and temporary assistance for the preparation and servicing of the sessions of the Commission ;  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
The bail-out strategies resorted to when a crisis occurred were becoming increasingly problematic : they protected creditors from bearing the responsibility of poor decisions , placing the burden entirely on debtors , tended to encourage imprudent lending practices on the part of international lenders and required such a huge amount of funding that they were reaching the limits of political acceptability .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
The view was expressed that , while the scientific principles formulated in the working paper submitted by the Czech Republic were acceptable , a comprehensive analysis of the legal aspects , as well as the scientific and technical aspects , of the geostationary orbit in one single document was required , taking into consideration the regulations of ITU , as the examination of those issues should not be approached in a piecemeal manner .  
This resulted primarily from the upward revision of local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent , effective 1 March 1997 , and the delayed liquidation of obligations no longer required , which could not be identified and cancelled in time before the closing of the accounts .  
The Treaty also provides that States shall be held responsible for national space activities , whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities , that they are liable for damage caused by their space objects and are required to avoid harmful contamination of space and the celestial bodies .  
At its fifty-fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights decided to retain on its agenda the sub-item entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required pursuant to previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation ( decision 1998 / 109 ) .  
The FRY Constitution stipulates that property is inviolable and that no one may be deprived of his property , nor may it be restricted , except when so required by the public interest , as determined by law , subject to fair remuneration which may not be below its market value ( art . 69 , paras . 2 and 3 ) .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
In other national laws a link is required between the property to be attached and the claim in that , for example , immunity can not be pleaded in respect of funds allocated for economic or commercial activity governed by private law upon which the claim is based or that immunity can not be pleaded with respect to assets set aside by the State to pursue its commercial activities .  
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
The new approach required that programmes be demand driven and consist of integrated services tailored to solve specific problems identified by clients in both the public and private sectors .  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
The initial configuration of the Missions aircraft fleet included two medium-utility helicopters required for logistical support and medical evacuation , one heavy passenger / cargo fixed-wing aircraft for supply / resupply tasking , including flights beyond the mission area and one light command and liaison fixed-wing aircraft also suited for medical and casualty evacuations to hospitals in neighbouring countries ( see A / 52 / 895 ) .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
The elimination of child labour required a comprehensive approach that addressed the conditions of poverty which caused and perpetuated the practice , and included solutions such as rehabilitation , alternative and remunerative employment for parents , the enforcement of legislative and administrative measures , and education and vocational training .  
It must therefore be concluded that sustainable , culturally appropriate and sociologically stable development can only be brought about when the educational processes required for development lead to professional outlets for those whose motivation for learning and development has a broader meaning than arrival at an often locally defined socio-economic status .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
Should the exigencies of the service permit , and subject to the prior approval of the Secretary-General , occasional compensatory time off may be granted to staff members serving at established offices in the Professional category who have been required to work substantial or recurrent periods of overtime .  
A staff member requesting such authorization will be required to satisfy the Secretary-General that the staff member maintained normal residence in such other country for a prolonged period preceding his or her appointment , that the staff member continues to have close family and personal ties in that country and that the staff member 's taking home leave there would not be inconsistent with the purposes and intent of staff regulation 5.3 .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
Staff members who have completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who have a permanent appointment may , if called by a Member Government for military service , whether for training or active duty , be placed on special leave without pay for the duration of their required military service . 
Any of the present rules may be suspended by a decision of the Congress , provided that twenty-four hours notice of the proposal for the suspension has been given , which may be waived if no representative objects ; subsidiary organs may by unanimous consent waive rules pertaining to them .  Any suspension shall be limited to a specific and stated purpose and to the period required to achieve it .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
The absence of resolve to call upon Eritrea to withdraw from all the territories it occupied by force ( as it was required to do ) , coupled with the lack of readiness of the Eritrean regime to reverse its aggression , no doubt encouraged Asmara to embark on repeated and futile efforts to regain the Badme area in late March and late May 1999 .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
Signature device means unique information , such as codes , algorithms , letters , numbers , private keys , or personal identification numbers ( PINS ) , or a uniquely configured physical device , that is required , alone or in conjunction with other information or devices , in order to create an electronic signature attributable to a specific person .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
Noting that since only 27.5 per cent of the electorate participated in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 , and the law required 50 per cent participation of registered voters for the results to be declared legally valid , the referendum was accordingly declared legally null and void ,  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
It has been established that sound of a quality very close to the standard requirements for simultaneous interpretation can be reliably transmitted using the required number of ISDN links .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
As a result , the allocations and expenditures in connection with developing the national economy have fallen below their pre-embargo levels , leading to poorer economic performance , lower available commodities and services required to meet essential needs and a rise in the price of most commodities and services , producing an inflation rate of over 200 per cent .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the world was stepping into the twenty-first century with the burden of many unresolved conflicts and stalemated peace processes , the meeting stressed that those conflicts posed a threat to peace and drained the scarce resources of the world , which were urgently required for the development and prosperity of the human race .  
It was recognized that the increasing number of international cooperative programmes in outer space required the continued harmonization of international intellectual property standards and legislation ;  
The future of life science research in space required enhanced international and interdisciplinary cooperation , scientific excellence and terrestrial applications , which would in turn lead to numerous benefits and industrial partnerships .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
When it is required to ensure liquid dangerous goods remain in their intended orientation , package orientation labels meeting the specifications of ISO 780:1985 shall be affixed on at least two opposite vertical sides with the arrows pointing in the correct direction .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
His delegation felt that the approach based on zero real or nominal growth ceilings was artificial and should be abandoned in favour of a new method which would primarily take account of programmes defined by common consent , the Secretariats role being to evaluate the resources required for their implementation .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
Paragraph 6 : as electronic commerce is rapidly spreading to many sectors of activity and regions , concerted action is required in order to allow all potential traders to rely on simplified , compatible procedures and practices , and to make the best possible use of modern technologies to lower costs of international trade transactions worldwide ;  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
A total of $ 9.7-million has been received ( from Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) ; however , $ 38-million is still required to raise to a basic minimum standard the functioning and efficiency of the local police forces .  
It was pointed out that the importance and urgency of work on insolvency law had been identified in a number of international organizations and there was wide agreement that more work was required in order to foster the development and adoption of effective national corporate insolvency regimes .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
It was pointed out that the importance and urgency of work on insolvency law had been identified in a number of international organizations and there was wide agreement that more work was required in order to foster the development and adoption of effective national corporate insolvency regimes .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .  
Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .

Due to the close relationship between heavy metals and the soil , along with the extremely complex composition of soil , it is much harder to get rid of this kind of pollution than it is when dealing with water and air . More time is required and the technology in this field is not as mature as it is with other industrial environmental techniques .

" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .

At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
Furthermore , deeper investigation is required into many questions , such as how many shark species are currently commercially fished and exploited , which commercial shark species ' populations are falling because of both shark meat and shark fin consumption and which purely due to demand for shark fins , and which real shark species ' fins are actually referred to by such shark fin market terminology as " white fin , " " black fin , " " Luzon yellow " or " tailhook . "  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation .

" Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it .

" They are required to be well-dressed and gentlemanly , at least on the surface , and they are made familiar with police detection techniques and procedures ; they are extremely alert and cautious .  
The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint . But this would not be realistic enough , and after some time the paint would begin to flake off . For better effect , Lin Chien-cheng added powdered metal to an acid - and alkali-resistant , non-oxidizing resin which he formed manually into the shapes required . He then polished them to create an effect which really does look completely like bronze .  
However , this part is no joke : in recent years , many young mathematical and science talents , identified as gifted in high school but unable to pass the intelligence tests required to enter college , have been weeded out of the special program as a result , and are forced to take the Joint College Entrance Exams with everyone else .  
Every part of a drama depends on coordinated staging , lighting , and costumes ; as well as on specialized input from the producer , art director , director , and musical director .

The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
For the mass of ordinary people , who are impatient and full of worldly desires , the idea of heaven as an essentially illusory mental state achieved by self-cultivation is abstruse and complex , and the continuous , unrelenting effort required to enter such a state is both hard to understand and hard to achieve . Thus it is understandable that a " heaven " in which religious concepts are simplified and popularized is preferred by proselytizers .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system .

However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees .

The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste .

" In the period ahead , it appears increasingly important that there should be simultaneous movements on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire Principle .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .

The series of major international conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations since 1990 had created broad public awareness of the existence of global problems and of the fact that their solution required joint efforts by States and by all of the world 's inhabitants .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
The Department of Public Prosecutions is taking the measures necessary to strengthen and develop the Office by increasing the number of its staff , providing it with an adequate number of highly qualified and experienced personnel to ensure the rapid performance of the administrative work concerning current cases in question being handled by the Office , and providing it with the modern technology in order to facilitate the collection and publication of statistics required for the serious monitoring of those cases .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .

This enhanced capacity is already going beyond the provision of such data as natural attrition rates , by working to introduce analysis of projected staffing and organizational structures at the macro , organizational level , and skill and staff needs required at the micro , departmental level .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;

Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;  
It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .

Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Statistics Canada 's globalization initiative was designed to meet that challenge , starting with the information required to understand how the various parts of a given firm fit together ; establish which of its parts are located in Canada ; deduce behaviour related to its condition ; and relate the firm 's performance to its new form of organization .  
The required data included the entire cross-border activity of firms , including trade in goods and services ; investment , both outbound and inbound ; and an indication of the relationship of the firms involved in such activity , such as affiliated firms operating as part of a global production network versus arms-length transactors .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
Reaffirms the urgent need for the international community to strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development ;

UNCTAD also maintains close relations with , and participates as required in meetings of , a wide range of international commodity bodies , including the organizations for cocoa , jute , natural rubber , olive oil , sugar , tropical timber ; the International Cotton Advisory Committee ; and the study groups for copper , lead and zinc , and nickel .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
However , the concern was voiced that , when read in conjunction with draft article B , which required such prior approval for certification authorities established in the enacting State , paragraph ( 1 ) might be read as allowing the recognition of certificates issued by foreign certification authorities which had not been authorized to operate under domestic rules , while denying legal effectiveness to certificates issued by domestic certification authorities that had not received the required authorization in the enacting State .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Indicators and best practices ( global urban observatory ) ; policy framework for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; global analysis of national enabling legislation and public policy formulation required for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda ; and human settlement conditions and trends : country profiles and statistical analysis ;  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year . 
The Commission shall meet annually , each session comprising a senior officials ' segment followed by a ministerial segment , for up to a maximum of seven working days to discuss and decide upon important issues concerning economic and social development in the region , to decide upon the recommendations of its subsidiary bodies and of the Executive Secretary , to examine and approve the programme of work and priorities and to take any other decisions required , in conformity with its terms of reference .

A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .

Senior staff of the Buildings Management Service inspected the current office arrangements and acknowledged that there was a need for additional office space ; however , they also indicated that the Fund 's requests had to be considered in the context of the amount of space required and the desired location ( the main Secretariat building ) , and the competing requests from United Nations departments and offices for contiguous space for their operations .  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .  International assistance was required to make regional activities more efficient .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .

What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
Resources required would specifically maintain a core capability , allowing the Base to fulfil essential functions , handling rapid surges of activity through the provision of temporary additional resources drawn from the budgets of the closing or new missions involved .  
His Government had worked tirelessly to set aside almost 1-million square kilometres - more than a tenth of the national territory - for the 330,000 indigenous people living in Brazil , a process that had required the adoption of special legislation to ensure its constitutionality . 
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .

In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
As argued in World Economic and Social Survey , 1997,3 Governments need to be sensitive to the fact that excessive enthusiasm for the quick reduction of budget deficits can have high economic and social cost and may not even be required for the fiscal probity that is indeed necessary in the medium run .  
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
Prisoners in chain gangs were reportedly required to perform heavy manual labour , such as rock-breaking or clearing rubbish from the highway , while shackled together ( or with their own legs chained together ) with metal chains , exposed to the public .  
Thus , in the light of this mandatory requirement for future peacekeeping operations , the Member States that have already pledged to the standby arrangements system may wish to exchange in advance data required by annexes A , B and C to the Memorandum of Understanding on contingent-owned equipment ( A / 51 / 967 ) , within the framework of the standby arrangements system .  
For an intergovernmental organization such as IOM , which works in a field with clear links to the issues dealt with by a number of United Nations organizations and bodies , timely , systematic interchanges and close working relationships with our partners promote the sorts of innovative , practical , cost effective initiatives required to address contemporary migration issues .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .

We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
However , the management of natural resources and human settlements , the provision of basic social services , the support required for targeted programmes for poverty alleviation , the correction of acute gender disabilities , social protection , employment generation and skill development , the improvements sought in public administration and governance all priorities defined by the global community are typically activities that require public resources spent through public entities .

Sound political logic and balanced reasoning are required from all of us , primarily with regard to the pivotal equation , that is , finding the golden mean between the level of representation on the reformed Security Council and the imperative need to ensure its effectiveness .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .

To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
All the while , a core of supporting multilateral agencies , despite severe financial constraints , have provided some of the required support and sought together , in a pragmatic manner , to identify their comparative advantages in responding to the countries ' perceived needs and in identifying the respective areas of complementarity .

The new approach required that programmes be demand driven and consist of integrated services tailored to solve specific problems identified by clients in both the public and private sectors .  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
The initial configuration of the Missions aircraft fleet included two medium-utility helicopters required for logistical support and medical evacuation , one heavy passenger / cargo fixed-wing aircraft for supply / resupply tasking , including flights beyond the mission area and one light command and liaison fixed-wing aircraft also suited for medical and casualty evacuations to hospitals in neighbouring countries ( see A / 52 / 895 ) .  
The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
The elimination of child labour required a comprehensive approach that addressed the conditions of poverty which caused and perpetuated the practice , and included solutions such as rehabilitation , alternative and remunerative employment for parents , the enforcement of legislative and administrative measures , and education and vocational training .  
It must therefore be concluded that sustainable , culturally appropriate and sociologically stable development can only be brought about when the educational processes required for development lead to professional outlets for those whose motivation for learning and development has a broader meaning than arrival at an often locally defined socio-economic status .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
Should the exigencies of the service permit , and subject to the prior approval of the Secretary-General , occasional compensatory time off may be granted to staff members serving at established offices in the Professional category who have been required to work substantial or recurrent periods of overtime .  
A staff member requesting such authorization will be required to satisfy the Secretary-General that the staff member maintained normal residence in such other country for a prolonged period preceding his or her appointment , that the staff member continues to have close family and personal ties in that country and that the staff member 's taking home leave there would not be inconsistent with the purposes and intent of staff regulation 5.3 .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
Staff members who have completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who have a permanent appointment may , if called by a Member Government for military service , whether for training or active duty , be placed on special leave without pay for the duration of their required military service . 
Any of the present rules may be suspended by a decision of the Congress , provided that twenty-four hours notice of the proposal for the suspension has been given , which may be waived if no representative objects ; subsidiary organs may by unanimous consent waive rules pertaining to them .  Any suspension shall be limited to a specific and stated purpose and to the period required to achieve it .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
The absence of resolve to call upon Eritrea to withdraw from all the territories it occupied by force ( as it was required to do ) , coupled with the lack of readiness of the Eritrean regime to reverse its aggression , no doubt encouraged Asmara to embark on repeated and futile efforts to regain the Badme area in late March and late May 1999 .  
This process was very complicated from both the legal and technical perspectives and required a lot of resources and international assistance , so for us it seems disgraceful and unjust that in the context of mentioning countries which have abandoned their military nuclear programmes or forsworn nuclear weapons the name of our country is sometimes not even found .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
Signature device means unique information , such as codes , algorithms , letters , numbers , private keys , or personal identification numbers ( PINS ) , or a uniquely configured physical device , that is required , alone or in conjunction with other information or devices , in order to create an electronic signature attributable to a specific person .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
Noting that since only 27.5 per cent of the electorate participated in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 , and the law required 50 per cent participation of registered voters for the results to be declared legally valid , the referendum was accordingly declared legally null and void ,  
The effective realization of the right to education provides an essential means of access to an adequate standard of living ; it ensures the access to knowledge required by individuals to develop all their faculties , to improve the quality of their lives , to take clear _ sighted decisions and to continue to learn , in order to live a dignified life within a democratic society .  
These needs comprise both essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions and to continue learning ( art . 1 , para . 
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
It has been established that sound of a quality very close to the standard requirements for simultaneous interpretation can be reliably transmitted using the required number of ISDN links .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
As a result , the allocations and expenditures in connection with developing the national economy have fallen below their pre-embargo levels , leading to poorer economic performance , lower available commodities and services required to meet essential needs and a rise in the price of most commodities and services , producing an inflation rate of over 200 per cent .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the world was stepping into the twenty-first century with the burden of many unresolved conflicts and stalemated peace processes , the meeting stressed that those conflicts posed a threat to peace and drained the scarce resources of the world , which were urgently required for the development and prosperity of the human race .  
It was recognized that the increasing number of international cooperative programmes in outer space required the continued harmonization of international intellectual property standards and legislation ;  
The future of life science research in space required enhanced international and interdisciplinary cooperation , scientific excellence and terrestrial applications , which would in turn lead to numerous benefits and industrial partnerships .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
When it is required to ensure liquid dangerous goods remain in their intended orientation , package orientation labels meeting the specifications of ISO 780:1985 shall be affixed on at least two opposite vertical sides with the arrows pointing in the correct direction .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
His delegation felt that the approach based on zero real or nominal growth ceilings was artificial and should be abandoned in favour of a new method which would primarily take account of programmes defined by common consent , the Secretariats role being to evaluate the resources required for their implementation .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
What is therefore required is a developmental approach to human rights , keeping in mind that all human rights are indivisible and the need for adequate importance to be given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
Paragraph 6 : as electronic commerce is rapidly spreading to many sectors of activity and regions , concerted action is required in order to allow all potential traders to rely on simplified , compatible procedures and practices , and to make the best possible use of modern technologies to lower costs of international trade transactions worldwide ;  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
A total of $ 9.7-million has been received ( from Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) ; however , $ 38-million is still required to raise to a basic minimum standard the functioning and efficiency of the local police forces .  
It was pointed out that the importance and urgency of work on insolvency law had been identified in a number of international organizations and there was wide agreement that more work was required in order to foster the development and adoption of effective national corporate insolvency regimes .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
It was pointed out that the importance and urgency of work on insolvency law had been identified in a number of international organizations and there was wide agreement that more work was required in order to foster the development and adoption of effective national corporate insolvency regimes .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .  
Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
While welcoming the recent developments in connection with the enhanced heavily indebted poor country ( HIPC ) initiative arising from the Cologne Summit , faster and deeper debt relief is required in order to enable African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
Noting that although 80.4 per cent of the 27.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on the political status of the Territory held on 11 October 1993 supported the existing territorial status arrangements with the administering Power , the law required the participation of 50 per cent of the registered voters for the results to be declared legally binding and therefore the status was left undecided ,  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The recently enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative ( HIPC ) arising from the Cologne Summit is indicative of the faster and deeper debt relief required in order to assist African countries to invest in human and physical infrastructure development .  
The scale of the financing required ruled out the possibility of continuing the current practice of making voluntary contributions on an ad hoc basis ; a more reasonable and transparent formula for sharing the burden would be needed .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
All countries , non-governmental organizations and international organizations concerned needed to be engaged in follow-up , and in that endeavour different methods of implementation , monitoring and evaluation that were sensitive to local cultural , political and religious traditions might be required , as well as active participation of the local population .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
If torture was practised in a State other than in very occasional instances , that meant there was a problem in the body politic and , therefore , in the body administrative ; correcting such problems required firm political will and considerable resources .  However , even though a long-term effort might be necessary , sight should not be lost of the urgency of eliminating torture .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
It was also explained that the words [ six months ] in paragraph 3 ( a ) reflected the view of some delegations that : ( i ) a maximum time-limit should be imposed for the carrying out of a visit / mission beginning at the time of the notification so that a notification was not left without being acted upon ; and ( ii ) a minimum period of prior notification should be required before any mission / visit took place .  
Acceptability - the form and substance of education , including curricula and teaching methods , have to be acceptable ( e.g . relevant , culturally appropriate and of good quality ) to students and , in appropriate cases , parents ; this is subject to the educational objectives required by article 13 ( 1 ) and such minimum educational standards as may be approved by the State ( see art .  13 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) ;  
The Declaration defines basic learning needs as : essential learning tools ( such as literacy , oral expression , numeracy , and problem solving ) and the basic learning content ( such as knowledge , skills , values , and attitudes ) required by human beings to be able to survive , to develop their full capacities , to live and work in dignity , to participate fully in development , to improve the quality of their lives , to make informed decisions , and to continue learning ( art .  1 ) .  
The benefits of space exploration should not be available only to those countries which possessed advanced technology ; international cooperation in that area was required , first of all to meet the requirements of developing countries , since the appropriate use of outer space could open broad possibilities for ensuring the sustainable economic development of all countries .  
To ensure the authenticity of all certificates , attachments and authorizations and any other documentation required to be submitted to authorities under these regulations , only original and certified copies shall be accepted or , if agreed to by the competent authorities of the countries concerned , the documentation may be transmitted by electronic means ;  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will . 21 bis .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
The note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
In the light of extensive measures under way to firmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform , adequate and proportionate financial support from various sources is required .  
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
The Commission is therefore convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach is required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at intergovernmental and inter-agency levels .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
She urged the Secretariat to take early and effective measures for the recruitment , on a broad geographical basis , of the staff required to replace the gratis personnel , and also to incorporate into the phase-out plan detailed transitional arrangements with a view to minimizing the cost of the process .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
The Commission attached priority to primary education , with the explicit objective to contribute to the attainment of compulsory primary education free of charge for all as required by international human rights law .  
The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
Since independence , the Croatian education system has undergone a major transformation ; national curricula and syllabuses now reflect new principles of economic , social and political development , thereby enabling pupils to gain access to the skills and responsibilities required in a democratic society .  
The propiska , in the form of a stamp in internal passports , restricted individuals to one legal place of residence and , on that basis , regulated many aspects of daily life as it was required in order to work , attend school , get married and engage in other important civic activities .  
Although the dug-out dwellings were not designed as permanent residences and required repair in certain aspects , the preference of the residents to remain in their traditional dwellings near their grazing lands provides a cautionary example of the need not to assume that more sophisticated , not to mention more expensive , structures will necessarily correspond to the needs and preferences of the intended beneficiaries .  
Specialized institutions devoted to specific sectors should be established and provided with adequate staff and budgetary resources for their operations ; such institutions are required particularly to deal with major resource conservation issues , such as those involving fisheries , coastal zones and biodiversity ;  
Knowledge , intent or purpose required as an element of the offences set forth in that paragraph may be inferred from strong evidence or objective , factual circumstances , the offender being required to give proof of the legitimate origin of the funds , rights or property .  
That the contracting authority concerned review existing statutory or regulatory requirements relating to the operation of infrastructure facilities of the type proposed with a view to identifying the main governmental bodies that have to give approvals , licences or authorizations or whose input will be otherwise required for the implementation of the project and take the necessary measures for coordinating their input to the proposed project .
