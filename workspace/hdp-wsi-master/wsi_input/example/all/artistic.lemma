In the appraisal and selection process , the standards we emphasized were : conforming to classical requirements of the Chinese art of calligraphy ; healthy language diction , readable handwriting ; certain standards of writing methods ; solid skills , and self-establishing a new artistic concept - - these are the characteristics of our Chinese art of calligraphy , and because we have these characteristics , we won the attention of foreign friends .  
Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
New actors and actresses must be diligent , assiduous , modest and prudent .  They must learn from the artistic morality and styles of old and famous actors and actresses in order to make larger steps on the road of art and to become mature faster .  
Facing the coming new century , how can the military 's literature and art be accepted by society , go out to foreign countries and develop into the future with its own unique aesthetic form ?  This is a new task faced by each of our military workers in the literary and artistic field .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
A few of them do not even want to become close to or understand the lives of the rank and file .  Some of our military 's literary and artistic workers do go into the lives of rank and file , but they mostly gain just a superficial understanding through cursory observation .  
Strengthening the study of the creative professions , the study and discussion of works , commentaries on literary and artistic works and focusing on the association of professional and amateur creative works are also effective ways to improve the quality of creative works and offer more excellent works .  
Because amateur creative works have a wide base of experience from the lives of the rank and file , professional literary and artistic workers must be good at absorbing nutrients from amateur works to enrich their own base of experience from the lives of the rank and file and broaden their own sources of materials from the lives of rank and file .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out : " Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of young people to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China . "  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
The requirements set by the third-generation core of party leadership have been conscientiously carried out , and constant attention has been paid to educating the army in advanced ideology , ethics , science , and culture and encouraging and inspiring officers and men with fine intellectual products ; as a result , they have in different periods of time created a number of fine literary and artistic works embodying the spirit and giving full scope to the central theme of the times .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The circular also called on various units to make good use of the compact discs distributed by the General Political Department to teach the singing of those songs , to organize literary and artistic workers to go deep among the troops to help train key cadres , to provide guidance for officers and men in learning to sing , and to bring about the singing of the songs to uplift the ethical standards of military personnel resonate in all barracks via organizing singing contest , holding evening parties , closed circuit television , and cable television .  
The creation of military-oriented literary and artistic works that we require means to reflect the mainstream of military life and to keep a lively and vivid record of this great age and the military 's modernization construction instead of generally reflecting the trivial issues in daily life in military camps .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
The mass media carries important responsibility in literary and artistic criticism ; it must propagate scientific theory and advanced culture , mold a good spirit , magnify a healthy social atmosphere , and promote scientific spirit to create a good environment for public opinion in developing flourishing literary creations .  
He said : Our contingent of professional literary and artistic workers is the backbone force in our country 's cultural building while the fine works can reflect in a centralized way both the epochal spirit and cultural standard of a country .

Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .

The ancient Chinese had a deep interest in the mystic form of mountains .

The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia .

Huang Wen-po has other ideas : " No matter whether the artistic status is crude or refined , these new style chen-t'ou are all products of a given era , have social significance , and deserve to be recorded . As for whether they can survive in the future , that 's for the market to decide . " He continues , " These type of chen-t'ou are refreshing , and at the very least are lots of fun , so there 's no point in attacking them . "  
Yao Yi-wei argues that the most artistic , refined drama is one that meticulously " makes the unreal real , " whereas " making the real unreal " is rampant in society .

This type of even more bizarre , more stimulating " performance " has diverted society 's attention . Who 's around to appreciate the real artists giving their all on stage ?  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .

In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .

For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
In former times , because the yew 's wood was not considered straight enough , it was not valued for making furniture or other utensils .

"  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .

" I 'll probably select paintings relatively Western in composition and in use of color , " says Yen Shen-jer , somewhat reluctantly . He notes that the classic Chinese ink painting artistic idiom , with its vivid moods , uninhibited yet subtle inks and impressionistic approach to nature , is not something that Westerners can simply understand at a glance . Therefore , in order to open doors for a foreign audience , it is necessary to make things accessible .  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Though the violins may be famous and expensive , visitors usually find the automated instruments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , on display at the entrance to the sixth floor , more interesting . When a volunteer demonstrates and explains the instruments , cranking the hand-powered gramophone , and starting up the player piano or the motor-driven " orchestra , " this old technology still proves capable of producing precise and beautiful melodies , leaving both adults and children amazed and struck with admiration for the artistic genius of our forebears .  
Yang San-lang 's father , Yang Chung-tso , was a famous poet of that era , and this was the " Wang Creek Villa , " whose grounds covered 180,000 square feet .

Both in terms of artistic atmosphere and privilege , Yang San-lang clearly enjoyed more favorable circumstances and a more fertile environment than other artists of his era .

As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures .

His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant .

He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Some people criticize Hanfu literature for being overly descriptive , and for using too much esoteric vocabulary , thus weakening its artistic capability to touch people 's emotions . It became increasingly verbose and pedantic , and packed with pretentious and irrelevant terminology . With regard to this , Ko Ching-ming says that in fact Han literati were very much aware of what they were doing .  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
In Zhou Chen 's Ning Qi Feeding an Ox , the brushwork of the trees and rocks is fluid and uninhibited , employing vigorous lines similar to those used in the work of Tang Yin , Qiu Ying , and even their predecessor Du Jin .

Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .

Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
The impact of Chiung Yao and Young Pei-pei inspired one Taiwanese producer after another to follow in their footsteps . Demand for specialized film sites in the mainland rose sharply , and with capital raised from various parties , a host of film studios were established , directly managed by or aided by members of Taiwanese artistic circles , each specializing in a different genre and era .  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
Li by this time had achieved considerable recognition in Taiwan for his skills , but he was n't satisfied , and so in 1991 he went to Yixing , a famous pottery center in China 's Jiangsu Province , to learn the secret of how the teapots from there got to be so perfect for the function of brewing fine teas . Studying under master potter Qin Youtao , Li learned to make Yixing-style teapots . His aim was to combine artistic sense and utilitarian excellence in his works .  
In 1989 , the company 's art editor brought back books of paper sculptures from an overseas trip . At the time , this form of artistic expression was relatively unknown in Taiwan , but Wu Ching-fang found the beautiful paper sculpture works on each page of the book strangely attractive and was especially fascinated by a Japanese book on paper cutting by Noda Ajin . These works clearly differed from Western pieces , tending to be more adult in orientation .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
In the old days , the wealthy regarded artistic brickwork , and wood and stone carvings , as ways to decorate their houses and flaunt their wealth . The last two have stayed as large parts of local culture , but brickwork somehow fell out of favor , and so Liao set herself to reviving brickworking as a living part of the culture .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .

Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
Anyone who visits the famous museums in Europe and the Americas will see many works of art and valuable manuscripts exquisitely wrought by the artistic creative hands of Arab Libyans , who left behind a great historical heritage which was looted and scattered around the world by the colonial Powers , which stripped away many of its most important features .

Of late there has been an abundance of initiatives from Islamic countries aimed at attaining those noble goals : Islamic civilization is an eternal civilization that has supported and contributed to numerous spiritual , philosophical , scientific , literary , artistic and other endeavours .  
It is thus absolutely incomprehensible to us that , in this day and age , the mind of a human being could entertain the senseless idea of destroying , in cold blood and for reasons having nothing to do with public utility , archaeological monuments whose value to humanity resides not only in their artistic merits and historical interest , but also in the venerability they derive from their association with one of the most ancient religions in the world .  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,

Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .  They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm .  They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
Similarly , if today 's new and promising actors and actresses with potential can not find opportunities to exercise or display themselves , it would be difficult for them to spring up , become outstanding successors of the military 's rank of actors and actresses and truly become pillars of the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  
New actors and actresses must be diligent , assiduous , modest and prudent .  They must learn from the artistic morality and styles of old and famous actors and actresses in order to make larger steps on the road of art and to become mature faster .  
Facing the coming new century , how can the military 's literature and art be accepted by society , go out to foreign countries and develop into the future with its own unique aesthetic form ?  This is a new task faced by each of our military workers in the literary and artistic field .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
In recent years , the military 's literary and artistic workers have been conforming to the spirit of President Jiang 's directive that the military 's construction of spiritual civilization must take the lead in the whole society .  Through assiduous efforts , they have created a large group of literary and artistic works loved by troops ' rank and file and the people .  
A few of them do not even want to become close to or understand the lives of the rank and file .  Some of our military 's literary and artistic workers do go into the lives of rank and file , but they mostly gain just a superficial understanding through cursory observation .  
Strengthening the study of the creative professions , the study and discussion of works , commentaries on literary and artistic works and focusing on the association of professional and amateur creative works are also effective ways to improve the quality of creative works and offer more excellent works .  
Because amateur creative works have a wide base of experience from the lives of the rank and file , professional literary and artistic workers must be good at absorbing nutrients from amateur works to enrich their own base of experience from the lives of the rank and file and broaden their own sources of materials from the lives of rank and file .  
In general , in literary and artistic creativity , the military must continue to carry forth a major theme while advocating diversification .  The military must encourage and support literary and artistic workers to go deep into troops ' lives and into the lives of the rank and file , to create excellent works reflecting the spirit of our times and encouraging the rank and file to go all out to make progress , and to provide more and better spiritual food for the broad number of commanders and soldiers .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out : " Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of young people to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China . "  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
The requirements set by the third-generation core of party leadership have been conscientiously carried out , and constant attention has been paid to educating the army in advanced ideology , ethics , science , and culture and encouraging and inspiring officers and men with fine intellectual products ; as a result , they have in different periods of time created a number of fine literary and artistic works embodying the spirit and giving full scope to the central theme of the times .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The circular also called on various units to make good use of the compact discs distributed by the General Political Department to teach the singing of those songs , to organize literary and artistic workers to go deep among the troops to help train key cadres , to provide guidance for officers and men in learning to sing , and to bring about the singing of the songs to uplift the ethical standards of military personnel resonate in all barracks via organizing singing contest , holding evening parties , closed circuit television , and cable television .  
The creation of military-oriented literary and artistic works that we require means to reflect the mainstream of military life and to keep a lively and vivid record of this great age and the military 's modernization construction instead of generally reflecting the trivial issues in daily life in military camps .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
We must introduce more excellent ideological and artistic work , encourage better scenes that are positive and forward-looking as well as healthy and beneficial , and produce more good literary writings that are to the point and clear , as well as drive out evil and usher in good .  
The mass media carries important responsibility in literary and artistic criticism ; it must propagate scientific theory and advanced culture , mold a good spirit , magnify a healthy social atmosphere , and promote scientific spirit to create a good environment for public opinion in developing flourishing literary creations .  
He said : Our contingent of professional literary and artistic workers is the backbone force in our country 's cultural building while the fine works can reflect in a centralized way both the epochal spirit and cultural standard of a country .

Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .

(  
Huang Wen-po has other ideas : " No matter whether the artistic status is crude or refined , these new style chen-t'ou are all products of a given era , have social significance , and deserve to be recorded . As for whether they can survive in the future , that 's for the market to decide . " He continues , " These type of chen-t'ou are refreshing , and at the very least are lots of fun , so there 's no point in attacking them . "  
Yao Yi-wei argues that the most artistic , refined drama is one that meticulously " makes the unreal real , " whereas " making the real unreal " is rampant in society .

A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid . After sorting the wheat from the chaff , Bartok incorporated the folk songs into his own works , thus not only creating a unique personal style , but also preserving folk music and raising it to a higher artistic level .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
" The artistic aura of Hou Hsiao-hsien 's The Puppet Master was similar in lighting and hue to that of the 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt . It needs to be illuminated with excellent facilities , " says Chiao . When screened in inadequately equipped theaters , the film is transformed into a murky block . The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
Xu Jiujing Rises in the Ranks of Officialdom , which was about the difficulties of being an honest official in the face of entrenched special interests , was popular on both Taiwan and the mainland . It too broke some artistic conventions in creating a lively character that combined two traditional Peking opera roles : the old man and the clown . ( photo by Hsu Pin )  
For instance , I used to get into earnest discussions with everyone about artistic methods and schools and about what was unique to Chinese art . But after I read the Western masters I discovered that they had thought about many of these issues hundreds or even thousands of years ago , and I found that those things which I deemed so special about Chinese art also exist in Western culture . And so in looking back , those past discussions seem pretty laughable .  
In former times , because the yew 's wood was not considered straight enough , it was not valued for making furniture or other utensils . But once people in Taiwan were well clothed and well fed , and their aspirations turned from the simply utilitarian towards a desire for valuable and unusual artistic artefacts , what had formerly been seen as the yew 's defects now became its virtues .  
In the Tang dynasty , brothels were places where the rich and powerful met and mingled , and the entertainers were not only stunningly beautiful , but were also accomplished in every kind of artistic skill and social grace , including " poetry and calligraphy , conversation both serious and humorous , singing and dancing , playing musical instruments and appreciating tea . "  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
The poet Alexander Pope was an early enthusiast for the Chinese view of nature and , with the help of Burlington , built a small garden on the bank of the winding Thames river in the south London suburbs . It had no fence , parallel paths or symmetrical flower beds . He planned to make it a place where he could engage in literary and artistic pursuits .  
He notes that modern national dress must have five key characteristics : it must be comfortable , artistic , modern , suited to the locality , and universal . He calls his ideal national dress shuya , which means " comfortable and elegant . " Taking the lead himself , two years ago he put aside his Western suits and asked a tailor to make a shuya outfit that Yu himself had designed . He wears it to work and to give lectures .  
" I 'll probably select paintings relatively Western in composition and in use of color , " says Yen Shen-jer , somewhat reluctantly . He notes that the classic Chinese ink painting artistic idiom , with its vivid moods , uninhibited yet subtle inks and impressionistic approach to nature , is not something that Westerners can simply understand at a glance . Therefore , in order to open doors for a foreign audience , it is necessary to make things accessible .  
The modern painter Mondrian constructed his artistic world from simple red , yellow , black and white squares ; and did n't Miro revel in a childlike , fairy-tale world ?  
Though the violins may be famous and expensive , visitors usually find the automated instruments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , on display at the entrance to the sixth floor , more interesting . When a volunteer demonstrates and explains the instruments , cranking the hand-powered gramophone , and starting up the player piano or the motor-driven " orchestra , " this old technology still proves capable of producing precise and beautiful melodies , leaving both adults and children amazed and struck with admiration for the artistic genius of our forebears .  
Yang San-lang 's father , Yang Chung-tso , was a famous poet of that era , and this was the " Wang Creek Villa , " whose grounds covered 180,000 square feet . When the chrysanthemums were in bloom , members of the social elite would gather here . Both in terms of artistic atmosphere and privilege , Yang San-lang clearly enjoyed more favorable circumstances and a more fertile environment than other artists of his era .  
Eighty to ninety percent of the new performers returning to Taiwan from studies abroad were trained in such classes . " Within the formal educational system , specially arranged art and music laboratory classes provide intensive training to develop artistic talents .  
As " artistic supervisor of character design , " Chang set about crafting the overall style of Mulan , and he discovered an element from classical Chinese painting that proved useful in animation-the " gossamer sketching " method of delineating human figures . In particular , the curving lines that form the hands of Buddhist deities , giving the effect of floating clouds or flowing water , became the artistic basis for the film 's character design .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Some people criticize Hanfu literature for being overly descriptive , and for using too much esoteric vocabulary , thus weakening its artistic capability to touch people 's emotions . It became increasingly verbose and pedantic , and packed with pretentious and irrelevant terminology . With regard to this , Ko Ching-ming says that in fact Han literati were very much aware of what they were doing .  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
1,000 years ago , under the rule of scholars who valued culture over military prowess , Song-dynasty China saw rapid economic development and brought forth remarkable cultural and artistic achievements .  
In Zhou Chen 's Ning Qi Feeding an Ox , the brushwork of the trees and rocks is fluid and uninhibited , employing vigorous lines similar to those used in the work of Tang Yin , Qiu Ying , and even their predecessor Du Jin . The techniques in which these painters were so adept fused the artistic heritage of earlier generations , from the Tang dynasty onwards , creating a distinctive style that captured the mood of the middle Ming period .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
But most farmers and laborers ca n't draw and paint . Born to a poor farming family in hard times , he had God-given artistic talent . Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
When the participants boarded the ferry and completed the short hop to Xiamen , it constituted the first cultural exchange between Kinmen and the PRC under the newly established " three mini-links . " It was very gratifying to see the artistic occasion carried off without the slightest hint of political overtones .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
The impact of Chiung Yao and Young Pei-pei inspired one Taiwanese producer after another to follow in their footsteps . Demand for specialized film sites in the mainland rose sharply , and with capital raised from various parties , a host of film studios were established , directly managed by or aided by members of Taiwanese artistic circles , each specializing in a different genre and era .  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
Most people feel that they have to dress up to enjoy art in traditional municipal galleries , and they have to make a special trip to get to them . But railroad art centers are bustling with life and allow people to experience cultural and artistic events in a natural and unplanned way . Art has been confined to museums and temples for too long : let it hop on a train and be carried from station to station around Taiwan !  
Huang Ming-che cut an impressive figure among his generation of young painters , the more so because through his engagement with Western masters close to his own sensibility , he continuously rediscovered where he needed to go . Without turning his back on his unique artistic qualities , Huang had the courage to accept other artists ' strong points . He gradually developed his own style and found new techniques to express it . His painting style evolved from Taiwanese localism to sentimentalism .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
Li by this time had achieved considerable recognition in Taiwan for his skills , but he was n't satisfied , and so in 1991 he went to Yixing , a famous pottery center in China 's Jiangsu Province , to learn the secret of how the teapots from there got to be so perfect for the function of brewing fine teas . Studying under master potter Qin Youtao , Li learned to make Yixing-style teapots . His aim was to combine artistic sense and utilitarian excellence in his works .  
In 1989 , the company 's art editor brought back books of paper sculptures from an overseas trip . At the time , this form of artistic expression was relatively unknown in Taiwan , but Wu Ching-fang found the beautiful paper sculpture works on each page of the book strangely attractive and was especially fascinated by a Japanese book on paper cutting by Noda Ajin . These works clearly differed from Western pieces , tending to be more adult in orientation .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
In the old days , the wealthy regarded artistic brickwork , and wood and stone carvings , as ways to decorate their houses and flaunt their wealth . The last two have stayed as large parts of local culture , but brickwork somehow fell out of favor , and so Liao set herself to reviving brickworking as a living part of the culture .  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .

Anyone who visits the famous museums in Europe and the Americas will see many works of art and valuable manuscripts exquisitely wrought by the artistic creative hands of Arab Libyans , who left behind a great historical heritage which was looted and scattered around the world by the colonial Powers , which stripped away many of its most important features .  The Arab Libyans laid the foundations of ancient , prehistoric civilizations .

It is thus absolutely incomprehensible to us that , in this day and age , the mind of a human being could entertain the senseless idea of destroying , in cold blood and for reasons having nothing to do with public utility , archaeological monuments whose value to humanity resides not only in their artistic merits and historical interest , but also in the venerability they derive from their association with one of the most ancient religions in the world .
