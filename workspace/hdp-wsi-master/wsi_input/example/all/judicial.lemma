This reporter has learned of the following information from the National Anti-Pornography Office : All localities in China have stepped up the crackdown on illegal publications , applying the law in harshly punishing the criminals involved in illegal publication cases .  Since the second half of 1999 , local judicial organs have again tried a number of important cases , imposed sentences on the perpetrators , and struck a powerful blow at and deterred criminals .  
In 1999 , they carried out 24,169 law-enforcement supervision projects .  As a result , illicit funds totaling 76.1-billion yuan and 20,384 clues to cases were discovered , 14,572 cases were registered for investigation , 4,939 persons were punished according to administrative disciplinary action , 1,462 persons were transferred to judicial organs for handling , and 8,070 suggestions were offered to improve work , thus averting and retrieving economic losses totaling 137.6-billion yuan .  
Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
In light of local situation and their own condition , they should spare no effort in formulating regulations concerning the construction of the grassroots contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  They should set forth their goal , task , and concrete measures .  They should strengthen their leadership over the task .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
Last year , it resolutely punished criminal elements who attempted to subvert state power and split the country .  In the struggle against the cult organization " Falungong , " the judicial contingent strictly applied the Criminal Law and relevant judicial explanations and sternly cracked down on criminal activities of organizing and using cult organizations to undermine enforcement of laws , cause deaths , and obtain state secrets illegally .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .  
CPPCC member Kong Lingren [ 1313-0109-0088 ] said : A perfect legal system has yet to be enforced by judicial officials who are steadfast in their political awareness , strict in discipline , honest and just , well-versed in professional knowledge and outstanding in their style of work .  Efforts must be made to strengthen the education and rectification of the judicial force .  
In the course of seriously enforcing law and trying cases , judicial organs throughout the country also raised judicial proposals to the relevant department in light of the problems they had discovered from specific cases , thus making positive contributions to promoting reform and opening up , ensuring steady economic development , and safeguarding social stability .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Gu Angran said : As reported by judicial organs , a more prominent problem that needs prompt solution at the moment is the question of what kind of work performed by personnel of such rural grass-roots organizations as villagers ' committees in assisting the people 's governments would subject them to the description of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  Therefore , the draft interpretation includes a stipulation only on this matter rather than on the full range of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  
He said : Now we already have copyright laws and pertinent criminal laws throughout the country .  In 1998 we further published laws and regulations against the smuggling of pirated goods .  We will also use for reference relevant foreign laws as well as laws in Hong Kong and Macao Regions , in strengthening administrative norms and making judicial interpretations of the antipiracy crackdown to make full use of legal weapons to crack down on piracy and protect intellectual property rights .  
The judicial and administrative sector has a huge force formed by 110,000 lawyers , 30,000 notaries public , 120,000 grassroots legal service workers , one-million mediatory groups , and 10-million people 's mediators .  This force plays a very important role in safeguarding social stability .  
After two years ' efforts , the " 148 " legal service hotline , which originated from Shandong , has spread all over the country .  It has become an important channel for party and government leaders and the public to know and understand judicial and administrative work , and an important means to bring the complex functional advantages of grassroots judicial and administrative departments into play and to strengthen grassroots judicial and administrative work .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
For illegal publications whose content was not pornographic or criminal , but which had not gone through the approval process , this judicial explanation made it clear that seriously lurid publications and the disruption of orderly markets could be punished as " illegal business operations " .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .  All those who really are concerned about the future prosperity and stability of Hong Kong held that Hong Kong 's judicial independence has not changed in the least by the interpretation .  
It is for this reason that Comrade Luo Gan put forward at the mobilization meeting that efforts must be made to ferret out and severely punish according to law the " protective umbrellas " and the backstage supporters in the party , government and judicial organs who support the criminal and vicious groups .  It is also essential to thoroughly destroy the social soil that breeds the criminal and vicious groups , he said .  
In sum , judicial and law-enforcing organs have punished the " Falungong " criminals , who disturbed social order with ulterior motives , not because they have practiced " Falungong " but because they have conducted unlawful and criminal activities and violated China 's laws .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The Standing Committee has also made a assessment of how administrative organs , judicial organs , and procuratorial organs carried out administration according to law and how the corporate law is implemented and an assessment of the work reports submitted by the cadres , who are selected and appointed by local people 's congresses , on how they discharged their legal functions and powers , enforced laws , and did official duties honestly and diligently .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
The open announcements of verdicts on the trials of the exceptionally serious serial crimes of Zhang Jun and Li Zejun embodied the firm determination of the judicial organs to mete out heavy , swift and severe punishments on criminals in accordance with law and persist in dealing " sure , accurate and ruthless " blows on all kinds of criminal activities that seriously undermine public order . 
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
Luo Gan pointed out : The judicial administrative work at the grass-roots level has close relations with the public security work .  In particular , the grass-roots judicial organs and the vast number of judicial officers are assigned to perform such duties as mediating disputes , giving publicity to laws , maintaining public order on the basis of laws , providing legal services , and helping and instructing people released upon completion of sentences .  
It is necessary to strengthen education in the party 's basic line and education on General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " so that the vast number of grass-roots judicial administrators and police officers will more firmly adopt a correct outlook on the world and on life and adopt a set of correct values , and will work faithfully in law enforcement , provide enthusiastic services for the people , and keep their own conduct upright and incorruptible .  
It is necessary to continue the activities of creating judicial organs that satisfy the people and being judicial officers who satisfy the people so that the judicial administrative contingent at the grass-roots level will be built into a strong force that is politically up to standard , keeps a strict sense of discipline , maintains a good work style , become more proficient professionally , and enforces laws rigorously .  
There are four types of conspicuous problems to be dealt with in this concentrated rectification ; The first consists of serious problems of violating law and discipline such as perverting justice for bribes , bending the law to serve friends or relatives , and engaging in bribery and graft , and in particular , serious problems of judicial corruption such as collusion with underworld forces and acting as an " umbrella " for lawless and criminal elements .  
We must perfect the supervisory and regulatory system , go about regulating the industry in accordance with the law , strengthen administrative supervision , judicial supervision , supervision by social intermediate organizations , supervision by public opinion , and user supervision to encourage telecommunications enterprises to raise their level of services .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
Great efforts were made to resolve prominent problems in law and order , and guarantee the implementation of the comprehensive measures for maintaining and improving law and order in society .  In connection with the " strike hard " anti-crime struggle , the contingents of law enforcement and judicial personnel were educated and rectified .  The routine work of maintaining law and order also consolidated and develop the results of the " strike hard " struggle , and guaranteed its smooth and successful development .  
Third , efforts must be made to maintain the country 's long-term peace and stability by taking further steps to ensure fiscal outlays for public security organs , procuratorial organs , people 's courts , judicial departments and other law-enforcement organs , giving positive assistance to the departments concerned in strengthening the comprehensive improvement of public order , energetically consolidating economic order in the marketplace and strictly cracking down on major crimes .  
The relevant judicial interpretations of the supreme court and the supreme procuratorate have not only criminalized homicide but also laid down relevant provisions on acts of disseminating and making Falungong propaganda material , resisting the implementation of state laws , vilifying or insulting others , inciting the split of the country , subverting state power , or assembling a crowd to assault a state organ or conduct cult activities .  China has a very full legal basis for cracking down on cults .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Third , the Basic Law is the HKSAR 's constitutional law that stipulates the various systems and policies practiced in the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems ; the system for safeguarding the residents ' fundamental rights and freedom ; the executive , legislative and judicial systems ;  
Hong Kong has kept its original way of life and social system , and continued to use the executive , legislative , and judicial systems that had proved effective .

As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
Over the years , the broad masses of judges and other judicial personnel of courts at the grassroots level have made continued efforts to increase their efficiency and quality in handling cases .  They have satisfactorily accomplished trial and implementing tasks .  They have made contributions to safeguarding social stability , promoting economic development , and ensuring that the broad masses of people can live and work in peace and contentment .  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .  
The court sources said yesterday 's court debate was splendid .  The judge was very tolerant and sensible .  Both the prosecution and defender could freely bring out their points .  As Zhang Jianzhong was speaking , Cheng Kejie , who was seated in the criminals ' gallery , listened to him with rapt attention , nodding to him many times to extend regards .  The court ended at 1800 .  Quite a few people from the judicial circles who had attended the trial as observers shook hands with Zhang Jianzhong to extend greetings .  
This method of restricting competition disrupts the arrangement of the central authorities to coordinate all moves throughout the country as in a game of chess ; in addition to seriously hampering the normal development of the market and being unhelpful for forming a unified market , it also wrecks the integrity of state legislative , administrative , and judicial powers and weakens the proper authority of the center .  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .  As a major readjustment of the civil justice , this will exert a positive and far-reaching influence on the practice and theoretical study of China 's justice .  
Zhu Mingshan , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court , indicated that during the continued restructuring , the courts at all levels in localities will readjust the names and functions of their divisions according to the organizational setup of the Supreme People 's Court . Organizational setup of higher and intermediate people 's courts should basically correspond to that of the Supreme People 's Court . People 's courts at the basic level should set up their divisions from the reality of conducting the judicial work in a comprehensive way .  
Supreme People 's Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan said today at a briefing on reform of the court structure that in order to meet the new demands and challenges on judicial work resulting from economic globalization and China 's WTO accession , the Supreme People 's Court will carry out a major reform of the court establishment and set up the no . 4 civil cases court specifically to deal with maritime affairs and law and disputes involving foreign and Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan businessmen .  
He said that as a result of this reform the establishment proportions in the Supreme People 's Court will become more rational , since the proportion of judicial staff in total staff will increase from 59 percent at present to 72 percent . the level of judicial work will be further enhanced , to ensure social stability and the healthy and orderly development of market economy . 
With the exception of major and difficult cases they , through study by the collegial panel , should be reported to the president of the people 's court for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council , and judgments of all cases are to be made directly by the collegial panel according to the law .  The chief justice will directly sign the final document according to the law .  
The chief justice will receive a special allowance according to the regulations and special consideration in time of promotion .  The system can thus create favorable conditions for enabling high quality judges to be discovered and become eminent .  It will fully whip up the working enthusiasm of all judicial personnel , enhance their interests in work and sense of responsibility , and also have a positive influence on improving the quality of all judges .  
According to the law , in the trial of a legal case , the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority should be followed .  The chief justice can not use his own opinion to replace the opinion of the majority of members of the collegial panel .  When there is a major difference between the chief justice and other members of the collegial panel , the matter should be reported to the court president for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council .  
According to information , the province-wide centralized activity for admonitory education will last for two months from August to September . The educational subjects will mainly be leading bodies and leading cadres of party , people 's congress , administrative , Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , and judicial organs at or above the county level in the entire province ; people 's groups ; and enterprises and institutions .  Other party members-cum-cadres will participate in the study sessions and discussions at the same time .  
The leaders in charge of the public security and judicial work and the comprehensive management of public security , as the direct responsible person for maintaining social stability , should actively organize and coordinate the relevant departments , clearly divide up the work and define responsibility , pool efforts to do the work together , and promote a smooth investigation and mediation of contradictions and disputes .  
This afternoon , NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng , speaking at the first plenary session of the NPC Standing Committee group for inspecting the Law of Criminal Procedure , urged group members to fully understand the significance of examining the way this law has been enforced to make sure that public security and judicial authorities have created sound internal supervisory mechanisms , handled all cases according to the law , and upheld judicial justice .  
Problems like these are quite serious in some regions and departments .  The coming inspection is an assignment for finding problems and then coming up with views and suggestions for solving these problems , and for prompting public security and judicial organs to implement the law more effectively by doing their work according to this law , to pay attention to the procedural law as well as the substantial laws , and to make constant efforts to improve their internal supervisory mechanisms .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
Through handling and reviewing criminal appeal cases , we are likely not only to strengthen our procuratorial organs ' capability of correcting mistakes on their own and ensure both strict and fair law enforcement on the part of our procuratorial organs but also to reverse some erroneous verdicts , rulings , or decisions ; exercise legal supervision over the judicial activities of some other organs ; and safeguard judicial justice in an effective way .  
Under this situation filled with opportunities , competition , and challenges , if our judges fail to pay attention to improving their study and enhancing their level and fail to pay attention to updating their knowledge in order to heighten their political , legal , moral , and professional quality as quickly as possible , they will not be able to meet the requirements for the development of judicial work and will be eliminated in the end .  
As a people 's court is an important judicial organ , it needs profound theoretical knowledge and qualified personnel who are capable of making correct use of the theory and vocational knowledge that they master in the practice of administration of justice .  
The current national work conference of procuratorial organs on promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorates will play an effective role in further deepening reforms in the procuratorial work , intensifying judicial supervision , guaranteeing fairness in law enforcement , promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorial organs , and bringing into the new century a contingent of high-quality procurators who will live up to the hopes of the party and the people and have a high degree of professional proficiency .  
The people 's courts should constantly maintain and carry forward the superiority of ideological and political work and realistically ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies in the course of doing adjudication work , so as to forcefully provide judicial guarantees and good legal services for the progress of reform , the maintenance of stability , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
The army , the armed police , the CPC committees and governments at all levels , and procuratorial , judicial and public security organs , treated the implementation of the policy decision as a serious political task .  They took vigorous and resolute action and worked in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner .  
India and Russia also signed 11 other agreements , including agreements on scientific and technological cooperation and on the joint exploration of petroleum and natural gas in areas off the coast of eastern India , and a memorandum of understanding on judicial cooperation .  
Since 1998 , thanks to economic responsibility auditing , various areas have uncovered a series of problems involving economic crimes committed by individuals , including graft , bribery , misappropriation , and so on , which have involved some 590 million yuan in all , with the result that some 200 people have been removed from office , some 470 people disciplined within the party or government , and some 1,010 people handed over to procuratorial , supervision , or judicial organs for punishment . 
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
The seminar was organized by the NPC Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee . Responsible officials of relevant departments of the NPC Standing Committee ; internal and judicial organizations of provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's congresses ; and the Ministry of Civil Affairs attended the seminar .  
As has been learned , the seminar , which is to close today , is sponsored by the NPC Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee . Attending are more than 60 people , including relevant responsible officials of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Civil Affairs , responsible officials of provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's congress internal and judicial affairs committees , and experts and scholars .  
Ningxia 's judicial , procuratorial , and public security workers have overcome all sorts of difficulties and played a key role in safeguarding social stability , cracking down on crimes , and protecting the property and lives of the state and the masses .  As a result , they have fully embodied the spirit of braving danger , performing functions and duties , bravely enduring hardships , and daring to shed blood .  
with the " Three Represents " as an important ideological guidance , conscientiously implementing the spirit set forth at the 15th Party Congress , at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and at the Central Economic Work Conference ; making strenuous efforts to help maintain social and political stability ; aggressively building up the political and legal ranks ; promoting judicial reforms ; ensuring strict and fair enforcement of the law ; and providing effective legal guarantees for the smooth execution of the Tenth Five-Year Plan and for reform and development .  
A Ming Pao reporter has learned that the NPC Standing Committee has recently set up a special group to study the legislation of a law to put raw materials listed in the International Anti-Narcotics Convention under control .  However , since such legislation involves many production and export administrative departments , as well as relevant judicial organs , it will take a relatively long time to officially promulgate such a law .  
In addition , the vast numbers of public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as armed police officers and men have devoted to their posts and indomitably fought against crimes , making great contributions to safeguarding social and political stability .  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council , Wei Jianxing expressed his sincere solicitude and high respect to all public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as all armed police officers and men in the country .  
With a focus on the grass-roots units and the activities of " striving to build advanced units , " public security and judicial departments should deepen the building of their leading bodies , reform their management system , intensify education and training , resolve prominent problems , and work to improve their overall quality so that they will always be vigorous and combat worthy .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
The same justice official stated that China needs to reform the backward judge training system , to improve judges ' quality , to perfect the system to raise judges ' quality , to put in place a rational and highly efficient training mechanism , so as to ensure smooth and in-depth carrying out of judicial reforms , judicial fairness , and to lay a foundation for nurturing talent .  
After illegally acquiring great wealth , the bosses of some criminal syndicate-style organizations suddenly change their identity by setting up companies , running factories , and acting as managers and bosses , protecting and nourishing their business through criminal activities , and doing everything possible to rope in and corrupt party , government , and judicial cadres and engage in graft in a big way so as to seek " protective umbrellas . "  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
Jiang Zemin also told senior officials of the Macao SAR and the principal responsible persons of the first-term legislative and judicial organs that they shoulder the important tasks of making a good start to correctly implementing " one country , two systems " in Macao , laying a good basis for enduring peace and stability in the SAR in the future , and setting an example for their successors .  I hope that you will deal with your work with a high sense of responsibility and sense of mission and make contributions worthy of the age .  
He suggested that the standard for assessing damages should be set according to the responsibility for fault and the degree of damage .  After discretionary circumstances are taken into account , an upper limit or a proportional figure on the amount of damages should be established and clarified in judicial interpretations to facilitate the handling by judicial organs of relevant matters according to law .  
He added : Both sides made positive appraisals of the smooth development of their friendly cooperative relations in all fields in recent years .  They unanimously believe that there is great potential in Chinese-Italian relations , which also have bright prospects .  From now on , both sides should strengthen mutual visits between personnel , economic and trade cooperation , cultural exchanges , and cooperation in the judicial field , including making joint efforts in smashing organized crimes .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .

Gao Changli was placed under the " double rules " because he took it upon himself to print quotations from Jiang Zemin ( purported to be distributed to all judicial officials across the country ) in his hometown in Shandong and because he illegally appropriated several Justice Ministry housing units for its public functionaries .

The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
This year , the " two supreme judicial organizations " will strengthen anti-corruption work and advocate honesty , severely punish crimes committed by state functionaries by taking advantage of their positions , attach importance to investigating and handling serious and major cases of corruption and bribery , abuse of power and dereliction of duties , and sternly crack down on sinister and vile forces so as to create favorable conditions for economic construction .  
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .  
Judges and procurators not only should have profound legal knowledge , but should also keep a firm ideal and belief , a strong sense of professional ethics , noble sentiments and morals .  Only thus can they guarantee judicial fairness .  
In the new year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate should orient their work to the general tasks of the party and the state , aim at maintaining social stability and promoting economic construction , persistently uphold judicial fairness , harshly punish criminal offenders and corrupt elements , and provide effective judicial guarantees and legal services for reform , opening up , and the development of the socialist market economy .  
In the course of deliberation , the deputies held that in the past year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate could actively advance institutional reforms and innovations in the judicial system , and played an important role in protecting the legitimate interests of the broad masses , safeguarding social stability , and guaranteeing the smooth development of economic construction .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .  
At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .  
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
During the discussion , the deputies unanimously stated : Over the past year , the " two supremes [ the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate ] " have strengthened judicial work in an all-round way ; have intensified legal supervision , deepened reform , or made redoubled efforts to build a contingent ; have pressed ahead with court reform or procuratorate reform at the grassroots level by firmly keeping in mind the overall interests of party and state work ; and have thus made fresh headway in all sorts of work .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government have extensively mobilized people in various circles to take a positive part in maintaining public order , and judicial , procuratorial , and public security organs have scrupulously performed their duties in protecting the environment of public security , thus ensuring political and social stability in the capital .  
Party committees and governments at various levels , as well as judicial , procuratorial , and public security organs , have been paying close attention to problems concerning social stability and public order .  As the " Falun Gong " cult organization has kept doing damage to society and the situation in public order has not been so optimistic , Beijing Municipality has adopted a series of effective work methods and measures to cope with the situation .  Now the municipality has established a whole set of operating mechanisms for maintaining social stability and public order .  
" As part of the territory of China , we have been authorised to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication , in accordance with our principal constitutional document , the Basic Law . "  
Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .  
Memoranda of understanding in respect of reciprocal arrangements for the service of judicial documents in civil and commercial proceedings , and in respect of the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards were signed on 14 January and 21 June this year respectively .  
In examining the statutory provisions in the laws of Hong Kong , the Government has also identified 28 statutory bodies which exercise quasi judicial functions and which for the time being have practical and operational difficulty in accepting electronic submission in their proceedings under their respective legislation .  
In accordance with the Basic Law , we have established the HKSAR Government and realised the principles of " One Country , Two Systems " , " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " .  Our lifestyle and social system remain unchanged .  The well established executive , legislative and judicial systems continue to function effectively .  Hong Kong society continues with its smooth and steady development .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
I am pleased to note that some Hong Kong lawyers have taken the initiative to develop a better understanding of the Mainland 's legal system .  It is being done with a view to ensuring that issues affecting both jurisdictions will be handled properly , all the while protecting the integrity of Hong Kong 's separate legal and judicial systems .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
So far as the legal system was concerned , the Joint Declaration provided that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would be vested with independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  It stated that the laws then in force would remain basically unchanged .  
By Article 2 of ICESCR , all State Parties are required to take steps to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights recognised in it .  The steps to be taken include not only legislative , but also administrative , judicial , policy , economic , social and educational measures and other steps .

The FATF Forty Recommendations , first developed in 1990 and subsequently revised in 1996 , provide a complete set of counter-measures against money laundering covering the judicial system and law enforcement , the financial system and its regulation , and international cooperation . 
" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
The Chief Justice said , " Before the Administration makes any decision on the Judiciary 's proposal ( which includes statutory prohibition of reduction in judicial remuneration in line with numerous jurisdictions ) , it would be inappropriate for the Administration to evade the issue by further cutting the Judiciary 's budget by an amount equivalent to the amount involved if judicial remuneration were reduced back to the levels as at 1 July 1997 .  
Some public housing tenants have recently expressed certain demands in connection with the judicial review .  Since their demands are closely linked to the Authority 's decision to appeal , the Authority therefore decided this morning that upon conclusion of the legal proceedings and clear judgment from the court on the proper interpretation and implementation of the relevant legal provisions , it would proceed to review its domestic rent policy and identify a satisfactory arrangement for rent adjustment immediately in accordance with the law . "  
At a joint meeting of Legislative Council 's Panel on Planning , Lands and Works and Panel on Environmental Affairs this ( October 13 ) afternoon , some members expressed that the Government and its legal representatives had led the court to believe that reclamation was not irreversible and the Government would suffer huge financial losses if the court ordered the work be stopped pending the outcome of a judicial review .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan . During the period of its construction , the island experienced rapid economic , social and political changes , and the heroes who built the road had to face a host of challenges , including waves of citizens ' protests , meddling from elected officials and organized crime , and investigations by judicial agencies , as well as natural disasters such as the 921 earthquake . The difficulties of construction included record-setting bridges , tunnels and challenges of all kinds .  
wang , who is a deputy to the eighth national people 's congress , told xinhua the constitutional institutes have organized scholars , teachers and judicial workers to conduct study and academic exchange through various forms they have achieved valuable academic results and promoted development of chinese constitutional theory  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .  
The establishment of such a tribunal must be based upon a careful and comprehensive examination of all the complex political , legal and judicial elements involved .  
In our view , a viable judicial system , supported by an effective civil and police administration , would in the short run assist the Government to put Rwanda back on its feet and enable it to pursue the goals of social and economic development .  
One representative recommended that , when dealing with international cooperation on judicial matters , the Commission should bear in mind the various statements reflecting changing international legal thinking on the subject .  
While it is true that without a judicial body responsible for implementing and enforcing it , a code would be superfluous , it is also true that without a prior strict definition of the applicable law , a court would be merely an ineffectual body .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
At the theoretical level , it was more logical for an international judicial body which was impartial , independent and representative of the international community to make such a determination .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ,  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
As regards judicial guarantees , the view was expressed that article 8 , which represented the bare minimum , should include the full range of generally recognized principles , arranged by categories , as established in international or regional instruments .  
In its opinion , the Committee first observed that if members of a jury were suspected of displaying or voicing racial bias against an accused , it was incumbent upon the judicial authorities of the State party concerned to investigate the issue and to disqualify the juror , if there was a suspicion that the juror might be biased .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
We have drawn this issue to the attention of the Security Council , and we are confident that as a result urgent action at the national , regional and international levels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization and cooperation in the judicial , police and even intelligence spheres , in order to halt this insidious manifestation of terror .  
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .  
Since the completion of the previous report , the Special Rapporteur has received information of more instances of the judicial system failing to take effective measures to identify and punish those responsible for crimes and to provide families and relatives of Serbian victims with proper legal responses to the death or disappearance of their relatives .  
Her Office 's assessment of the situation was that it was easier to work to have rape classified as a public crime than to try to reverse the burden of proof requirement , which involved going against the entrenched judicial , religious , social and cultural prejudices which came into play whenever such a debate arose in Bolivia .  
Calls on all parties concerned to respond positively to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter , which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiation , mediation and judicial procedures , and calls for a fair and impartial trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
In particular , many delegations noted with satisfaction that by establishing a system of international criminal jurisdiction based primarily on the consent of the States concerned with the alleged crime and complementary to existing national jurisdictions and procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters , the draft reconciled the need for an international criminal court and respect for State sovereignty .  
It was noted that neither the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in some national legislation nor the mechanism of international judicial cooperation was sufficient to achieve the said objective and that , while it was incumbent on Governments to bring such individuals to justice , the international community could complement and assist national efforts , in particular in situations where authorities were not in a position to maintain law and order .  
One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
Unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women undermine women 's access to full and equal rights .  
It is requested that an international judicial fact-finding mission be formed within 30 days ; it shall be composed of competent and impartial persons to investigate the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at of 21 October 1993 and what the political partners have agreed to call genocide without prejudice to the outcome of the independent national and international investigations , as well as the various political crimes that have been committed since October 1993 .  Article 37 .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
After the full and final reimbursement of all accepted claims from eligible participating Governments in the Unified Task Force , the balance of individual contributions remaining in the fund was transferred , according to the wishes of the contributing countries , to the two sub-accounts established for the support of the Somali police force and judicial and penal systems , and for the support of UNOSOM II forces , or returned to the contributor .  
Under constitutional systems based on the separation of judicial power , a central element in an offence could not be left to be conclusively determined by an international executive agency such as the Security Council .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
[ Create , fund , and improve ] or develop the training of judicial , legal , medical , social , educational and police and immigration personnel , as appropriate , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured ;  
The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
In governmental systems , this is the basic infrastructure for the exercise of legitimate authority : a legal system , a judicial system , a police system , a prison system for those who act outside the law , and the design of governmental institutions that ensure informed , voluntary choice by the citizens .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;  
The task entrusted to me was that of determining , on the one hand , whether the relevant national entities in Burundi are prepared to institute a commission on the truth similar to the one set up in El Salvador ; and , on the other , whether a judicial fact-finding commission could be established as an alternative to a commission on the truth .  
Deeply concerned by the situation in Rwanda 's prisons and judicial system , particularly overcrowding , the lack of judges , detention of minors and elderly prisoners , and absence of speedy judicial or administrative review of charges , and in this respect , welcoming renewed efforts by the United Nations and donor countries , in coordination with the Government of Rwanda , to initiate , on an urgent basis , measures to improve this situation ,

Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]  
Pursuant to article 17 of the statute , it is responsible for the Tribunal 's administration but also for setting up the infrastructure required to ensure the proper functioning of the judicial process in a particularly sensitive and important area of criminal law .  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices perpetuate women 's de facto inequality .  
At the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited .

Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
After the full and final reimbursement of all accepted claims from eligible participating Governments in the Unified Task Force , the balance of individual contributions remaining in the fund was transferred , according to the wishes of the contributing countries , to the two sub-accounts established for the support of the Somali police force and judicial and penal systems , and for the support of UNOSOM II forces .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
While the former limitations are constant , being structural , and in principle could be removed only at the cost of a distortion of the judicial function or a profound transformation of the political environment in which it is performed , the latter are reversible , but have the drawback of being extremely unpredictable . 
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
FENG Cui ( China ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the representatives of the United States and the European Union had attacked the Chinese Government in their statements and made unfounded allegations , interfering in China 's internal affairs , maligning its judicial system and claiming that China practised torture , misused the death sentence and restricted freedom of speech .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
The following questions , among others , were considered : protection of aboriginal people , including land claims and self-government ; protection against discrimination with respect to race and sex ; assistance programmes for minorities ; incorporation in human rights legislation of more explicit reference to economic , social and cultural rights ; judicial control over administrative decisions ; and differences between provincial and federal legislation in the field of human rights .  
The High Commissioner raised such matters as : arbitrary and preventive detention ; the treatment of detainees , including cases of custodial rape by members of the police and security forces ; cases of enforced disappearance ; failure to take judicial action against police officers accused of violations of human rights ; the partial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to disturbed areas of the country ; social inequalities relating to the caste system ; and policies adopted to eliminate the caste of untouchable .  
SRIWIDJAJA ( Indonesia ) said it was vital that the jurisdiction of the international criminal court should be universally accepted , and he concurred with the view that the court should be established as an independent judicial organ by means of a multilateral treaty , as recommended by the International Law Commission .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .

Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
In these circumstances , as announced in Declaration 1 / 88 of 18 September 1988 , the Armed Forces established martial law , overturning the Constitution of 1974 , dissolved all State organs , including the Pyithu Hluttaw ( People 's Assembly ) and the State Council . The Armed Forces constituted for itself the State Law and Order Council ( SLORC ) which assumed all legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .

For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
The integrity and efficiency of the judicial function fulfil the task of guaranteeing the rules of social relations , a guarantee which can become operative only if there is security , as manifested in the substantive rights prescribed by law , the fair settlement of disputes , universal respect for procedural norms , the punishment of offenders and reparation for injury .

The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .

"

The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .

Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .

In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .

With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .

For non _ international armed conflicts , the elements of the offence are only met when the combined violations of penal provisions rise to the level of denying indispensable judicial guarantees recognized by all civilized peoples .  
The widely prevailing view had been that a model national statute , or set of legislative provisions , would be appropriate to give judicial cooperation a clearer legal framework .

With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .

A strong and independent judiciary is unthinkable in any political system other than a genuine democracy in which there is a clear separation of the three state powers : the executive , the legislative and the judicial .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .

The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
b .

The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .

Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .

Such review can be carried out by a competent jurisdiction of an administrative or judicial nature in conformity with the internal law of each State . 81 / The adjective effective is intended to stress the fact that an opportunity must be provided to permit meaningful review of the relevant substantive issues . 
On the basis of a vast amount of documentation , the work of the Working Group and oral testimony , the Special Rapporteur has reached the conclusion that there is an almost unanimous opinion among geographically-dispersed indigenous peoples that existing State mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , are unable to satisfy their aspirations and hopes for redress .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .

This proactive and resolutely political choice is based on a rejection of all forms of discrimination against women , which is the reason why today women are present in all areas of social activity , including in high-level legislative , executive and judicial posts . 
Comparisons with other regulatory mechanisms for analogous markets ( such as the transport of toxic wastes and hazardous products , the regulation of securities and financial markets and institutions , the marking and tracing of weapons and other commercial goods , and treaty instruments containing provisions for judicial cooperation or extraterritorial jurisdiction ) should also be examined .  
In Rwanda , UNHCR has been actively participating in the Rwandan Womens Initiative designed to promote womens rights and participation in political , legislative and judicial arenas and institutions , as well as equal participation in economic and socio-cultural affairs , and to combat violence and other harmful practices against women and young girls .

Prohibits national courts from recognizing and executing foreign judicial decisions and orders which are directed against enterprises established or situated in Mexico and based on foreign laws that have extraterritorial effects and are contrary to international law ;  
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .

This reporter has learned of the following information from the National Anti-Pornography Office : All localities in China have stepped up the crackdown on illegal publications , applying the law in harshly punishing the criminals involved in illegal publication cases .  Since the second half of 1999 , local judicial organs have again tried a number of important cases , imposed sentences on the perpetrators , and struck a powerful blow at and deterred criminals .  
In 1999 , they carried out 24,169 law-enforcement supervision projects .  As a result , illicit funds totaling 76.1-billion yuan and 20,384 clues to cases were discovered , 14,572 cases were registered for investigation , 4,939 persons were punished according to administrative disciplinary action , 1,462 persons were transferred to judicial organs for handling , and 8,070 suggestions were offered to improve work , thus averting and retrieving economic losses totaling 137.6-billion yuan .  
Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
In light of local situation and their own condition , they should spare no effort in formulating regulations concerning the construction of the grassroots contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  They should set forth their goal , task , and concrete measures .  They should strengthen their leadership over the task .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .

Last year , it resolutely punished criminal elements who attempted to subvert state power and split the country .  In the struggle against the cult organization " Falungong , " the judicial contingent strictly applied the Criminal Law and relevant judicial explanations and sternly cracked down on criminal activities of organizing and using cult organizations to undermine enforcement of laws , cause deaths , and obtain state secrets illegally .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .  
CPPCC member Kong Lingren [ 1313-0109-0088 ] said : A perfect legal system has yet to be enforced by judicial officials who are steadfast in their political awareness , strict in discipline , honest and just , well-versed in professional knowledge and outstanding in their style of work .  Efforts must be made to strengthen the education and rectification of the judicial force .  
In the course of seriously enforcing law and trying cases , judicial organs throughout the country also raised judicial proposals to the relevant department in light of the problems they had discovered from specific cases , thus making positive contributions to promoting reform and opening up , ensuring steady economic development , and safeguarding social stability .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Gu Angran said : As reported by judicial organs , a more prominent problem that needs prompt solution at the moment is the question of what kind of work performed by personnel of such rural grass-roots organizations as villagers ' committees in assisting the people 's governments would subject them to the description of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  Therefore , the draft interpretation includes a stipulation only on this matter rather than on the full range of " personnel engaged in official business according to law . "  
He said : Now we already have copyright laws and pertinent criminal laws throughout the country .  In 1998 we further published laws and regulations against the smuggling of pirated goods .  We will also use for reference relevant foreign laws as well as laws in Hong Kong and Macao Regions , in strengthening administrative norms and making judicial interpretations of the antipiracy crackdown to make full use of legal weapons to crack down on piracy and protect intellectual property rights .  
The judicial and administrative sector has a huge force formed by 110,000 lawyers , 30,000 notaries public , 120,000 grassroots legal service workers , one-million mediatory groups , and 10-million people 's mediators .  This force plays a very important role in safeguarding social stability .  
After two years ' efforts , the " 148 " legal service hotline , which originated from Shandong , has spread all over the country .  It has become an important channel for party and government leaders and the public to know and understand judicial and administrative work , and an important means to bring the complex functional advantages of grassroots judicial and administrative departments into play and to strengthen grassroots judicial and administrative work .  
The " 148 " hotline is a socialized , mass , complex legal service project , which needs to be run after an operational pattern characterized by persistent , unified leadership of the party committee , close support by related departments , and comprehensive coordination among judicial and administrative organs .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .

It is for this reason that Comrade Luo Gan put forward at the mobilization meeting that efforts must be made to ferret out and severely punish according to law the " protective umbrellas " and the backstage supporters in the party , government and judicial organs who support the criminal and vicious groups .  It is also essential to thoroughly destroy the social soil that breeds the criminal and vicious groups , he said .  
In sum , judicial and law-enforcing organs have punished the " Falungong " criminals , who disturbed social order with ulterior motives , not because they have practiced " Falungong " but because they have conducted unlawful and criminal activities and violated China 's laws .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
The Standing Committee has also made a assessment of how administrative organs , judicial organs , and procuratorial organs carried out administration according to law and how the corporate law is implemented and an assessment of the work reports submitted by the cadres , who are selected and appointed by local people 's congresses , on how they discharged their legal functions and powers , enforced laws , and did official duties honestly and diligently .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
The open announcements of verdicts on the trials of the exceptionally serious serial crimes of Zhang Jun and Li Zejun embodied the firm determination of the judicial organs to mete out heavy , swift and severe punishments on criminals in accordance with law and persist in dealing " sure , accurate and ruthless " blows on all kinds of criminal activities that seriously undermine public order . 
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
Luo Gan pointed out : The judicial administrative work at the grass-roots level has close relations with the public security work .  In particular , the grass-roots judicial organs and the vast number of judicial officers are assigned to perform such duties as mediating disputes , giving publicity to laws , maintaining public order on the basis of laws , providing legal services , and helping and instructing people released upon completion of sentences .  
It is necessary to strengthen education in the party 's basic line and education on General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " so that the vast number of grass-roots judicial administrators and police officers will more firmly adopt a correct outlook on the world and on life and adopt a set of correct values , and will work faithfully in law enforcement , provide enthusiastic services for the people , and keep their own conduct upright and incorruptible .  
It is necessary to continue the activities of creating judicial organs that satisfy the people and being judicial officers who satisfy the people so that the judicial administrative contingent at the grass-roots level will be built into a strong force that is politically up to standard , keeps a strict sense of discipline , maintains a good work style , become more proficient professionally , and enforces laws rigorously .  
There are four types of conspicuous problems to be dealt with in this concentrated rectification ; The first consists of serious problems of violating law and discipline such as perverting justice for bribes , bending the law to serve friends or relatives , and engaging in bribery and graft , and in particular , serious problems of judicial corruption such as collusion with underworld forces and acting as an " umbrella " for lawless and criminal elements .  
We must perfect the supervisory and regulatory system , go about regulating the industry in accordance with the law , strengthen administrative supervision , judicial supervision , supervision by social intermediate organizations , supervision by public opinion , and user supervision to encourage telecommunications enterprises to raise their level of services .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
Great efforts were made to resolve prominent problems in law and order , and guarantee the implementation of the comprehensive measures for maintaining and improving law and order in society .

China has a very full legal basis for cracking down on cults .

As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
Over the years , the broad masses of judges and other judicial personnel of courts at the grassroots level have made continued efforts to increase their efficiency and quality in handling cases .  They have satisfactorily accomplished trial and implementing tasks .  They have made contributions to safeguarding social stability , promoting economic development , and ensuring that the broad masses of people can live and work in peace and contentment .

Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .  
The court sources said yesterday 's court debate was splendid .  The judge was very tolerant and sensible .  Both the prosecution and defender could freely bring out their points .  As Zhang Jianzhong was speaking , Cheng Kejie , who was seated in the criminals ' gallery , listened to him with rapt attention , nodding to him many times to extend regards .  The court ended at 1800 .  Quite a few people from the judicial circles who had attended the trial as observers shook hands with Zhang Jianzhong to extend greetings .  
This method of restricting competition disrupts the arrangement of the central authorities to coordinate all moves throughout the country as in a game of chess ; in addition to seriously hampering the normal development of the market and being unhelpful for forming a unified market , it also wrecks the integrity of state legislative , administrative , and judicial powers and weakens the proper authority of the center .  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
Luo Gan said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very much concerned about Xinjiang 's economic development and social and political stability .  The task of maintaining Xinjiang 's social and political stability is arduous so I hope that Xinjiang 's judicial organs , under direct leadership of the regional party committee and government , will further seek consensus , strengthen cooperation , duly focus attention on the drive to improve social order , and carry out other special struggles .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .  As a major readjustment of the civil justice , this will exert a positive and far-reaching influence on the practice and theoretical study of China 's justice .  
Zhu Mingshan , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court , indicated that during the continued restructuring , the courts at all levels in localities will readjust the names and functions of their divisions according to the organizational setup of the Supreme People 's Court . Organizational setup of higher and intermediate people 's courts should basically correspond to that of the Supreme People 's Court . People 's courts at the basic level should set up their divisions from the reality of conducting the judicial work in a comprehensive way .  
Supreme People 's Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan said today at a briefing on reform of the court structure that in order to meet the new demands and challenges on judicial work resulting from economic globalization and China 's WTO accession , the Supreme People 's Court will carry out a major reform of the court establishment and set up the no . 4 civil cases court specifically to deal with maritime affairs and law and disputes involving foreign and Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan businessmen .  
He said that as a result of this reform the establishment proportions in the Supreme People 's Court will become more rational , since the proportion of judicial staff in total staff will increase from 59 percent at present to 72 percent . the level of judicial work will be further enhanced , to ensure social stability and the healthy and orderly development of market economy . 
With the exception of major and difficult cases they , through study by the collegial panel , should be reported to the president of the people 's court for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council , and judgments of all cases are to be made directly by the collegial panel according to the law .  The chief justice will directly sign the final document according to the law .  
The chief justice will receive a special allowance according to the regulations and special consideration in time of promotion .  The system can thus create favorable conditions for enabling high quality judges to be discovered and become eminent .  It will fully whip up the working enthusiasm of all judicial personnel , enhance their interests in work and sense of responsibility , and also have a positive influence on improving the quality of all judges .  
According to the law , in the trial of a legal case , the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority should be followed .  The chief justice can not use his own opinion to replace the opinion of the majority of members of the collegial panel .  When there is a major difference between the chief justice and other members of the collegial panel , the matter should be reported to the court president for discussion and final judgment by the judicial council .  
According to information , the province-wide centralized activity for admonitory education will last for two months from August to September . The educational subjects will mainly be leading bodies and leading cadres of party , people 's congress , administrative , Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference [ CPPCC ] , and judicial organs at or above the county level in the entire province ; people 's groups ; and enterprises and institutions .  Other party members-cum-cadres will participate in the study sessions and discussions at the same time .  
The leaders in charge of the public security and judicial work and the comprehensive management of public security , as the direct responsible person for maintaining social stability , should actively organize and coordinate the relevant departments , clearly divide up the work and define responsibility , pool efforts to do the work together , and promote a smooth investigation and mediation of contradictions and disputes .  
This afternoon , NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng , speaking at the first plenary session of the NPC Standing Committee group for inspecting the Law of Criminal Procedure , urged group members to fully understand the significance of examining the way this law has been enforced to make sure that public security and judicial authorities have created sound internal supervisory mechanisms , handled all cases according to the law , and upheld judicial justice .  
Problems like these are quite serious in some regions and departments .  The coming inspection is an assignment for finding problems and then coming up with views and suggestions for solving these problems , and for prompting public security and judicial organs to implement the law more effectively by doing their work according to this law , to pay attention to the procedural law as well as the substantial laws , and to make constant efforts to improve their internal supervisory mechanisms .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
Through handling and reviewing criminal appeal cases , we are likely not only to strengthen our procuratorial organs ' capability of correcting mistakes on their own and ensure both strict and fair law enforcement on the part of our procuratorial organs but also to reverse some erroneous verdicts , rulings , or decisions ; exercise legal supervision over the judicial activities of some other organs ; and safeguard judicial justice in an effective way .  
Under this situation filled with opportunities , competition , and challenges , if our judges fail to pay attention to improving their study and enhancing their level and fail to pay attention to updating their knowledge in order to heighten their political , legal , moral , and professional quality as quickly as possible , they will not be able to meet the requirements for the development of judicial work and will be eliminated in the end .  
As a people 's court is an important judicial organ , it needs profound theoretical knowledge and qualified personnel who are capable of making correct use of the theory and vocational knowledge that they master in the practice of administration of justice .  
The current national work conference of procuratorial organs on promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorates will play an effective role in further deepening reforms in the procuratorial work , intensifying judicial supervision , guaranteeing fairness in law enforcement , promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorial organs , and bringing into the new century a contingent of high-quality procurators who will live up to the hopes of the party and the people and have a high degree of professional proficiency .  
The people 's courts should constantly maintain and carry forward the superiority of ideological and political work and realistically ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies in the course of doing adjudication work , so as to forcefully provide judicial guarantees and good legal services for the progress of reform , the maintenance of stability , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .

It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .

A Ming Pao reporter has learned that the NPC Standing Committee has recently set up a special group to study the legislation of a law to put raw materials listed in the International Anti-Narcotics Convention under control .  However , since such legislation involves many production and export administrative departments , as well as relevant judicial organs , it will take a relatively long time to officially promulgate such a law .  
In addition , the vast numbers of public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as armed police officers and men have devoted to their posts and indomitably fought against crimes , making great contributions to safeguarding social and political stability .  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council , Wei Jianxing expressed his sincere solicitude and high respect to all public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as all armed police officers and men in the country .  
With a focus on the grass-roots units and the activities of " striving to build advanced units , " public security and judicial departments should deepen the building of their leading bodies , reform their management system , intensify education and training , resolve prominent problems , and work to improve their overall quality so that they will always be vigorous and combat worthy .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
The same justice official stated that China needs to reform the backward judge training system , to improve judges ' quality , to perfect the system to raise judges ' quality , to put in place a rational and highly efficient training mechanism , so as to ensure smooth and in-depth carrying out of judicial reforms , judicial fairness , and to lay a foundation for nurturing talent .  
After illegally acquiring great wealth , the bosses of some criminal syndicate-style organizations suddenly change their identity by setting up companies , running factories , and acting as managers and bosses , protecting and nourishing their business through criminal activities , and doing everything possible to rope in and corrupt party , government , and judicial cadres and engage in graft in a big way so as to seek " protective umbrellas . "  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
Jiang Zemin also told senior officials of the Macao SAR and the principal responsible persons of the first-term legislative and judicial organs that they shoulder the important tasks of making a good start to correctly implementing " one country , two systems " in Macao , laying a good basis for enduring peace and stability in the SAR in the future , and setting an example for their successors .  I hope that you will deal with your work with a high sense of responsibility and sense of mission and make contributions worthy of the age .  
He suggested that the standard for assessing damages should be set according to the responsibility for fault and the degree of damage .  After discretionary circumstances are taken into account , an upper limit or a proportional figure on the amount of damages should be established and clarified in judicial interpretations to facilitate the handling by judicial organs of relevant matters according to law .  
He added : Both sides made positive appraisals of the smooth development of their friendly cooperative relations in all fields in recent years .  They unanimously believe that there is great potential in Chinese-Italian relations , which also have bright prospects .  From now on , both sides should strengthen mutual visits between personnel , economic and trade cooperation , cultural exchanges , and cooperation in the judicial field , including making joint efforts in smashing organized crimes .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
He emphasized the importance of " administering Macao according to law " in ensuring Macao 's stability and prosperity and hoped the Legislative Council will continue to closely coordinate in its work with the executive and judicial departments of the special administrative region in future to jointly build Macao 's beautiful tomorrow .  
Gao Changli was placed under the " double rules " because he took it upon himself to print quotations from Jiang Zemin ( purported to be distributed to all judicial officials across the country ) in his hometown in Shandong and because he illegally appropriated several Justice Ministry housing units for its public functionaries .

The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
This year , the " two supreme judicial organizations " will strengthen anti-corruption work and advocate honesty , severely punish crimes committed by state functionaries by taking advantage of their positions , attach importance to investigating and handling serious and major cases of corruption and bribery , abuse of power and dereliction of duties , and sternly crack down on sinister and vile forces so as to create favorable conditions for economic construction .  
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .  
Judges and procurators not only should have profound legal knowledge , but should also keep a firm ideal and belief , a strong sense of professional ethics , noble sentiments and morals .  Only thus can they guarantee judicial fairness .  
In the new year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate should orient their work to the general tasks of the party and the state , aim at maintaining social stability and promoting economic construction , persistently uphold judicial fairness , harshly punish criminal offenders and corrupt elements , and provide effective judicial guarantees and legal services for reform , opening up , and the development of the socialist market economy .  
In the course of deliberation , the deputies held that in the past year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate could actively advance institutional reforms and innovations in the judicial system , and played an important role in protecting the legitimate interests of the broad masses , safeguarding social stability , and guaranteeing the smooth development of economic construction .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .

During the discussion , the deputies unanimously stated : Over the past year , the " two supremes [ the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate ] " have strengthened judicial work in an all-round way ; have intensified legal supervision , deepened reform , or made redoubled efforts to build a contingent ; have pressed ahead with court reform or procuratorate reform at the grassroots level by firmly keeping in mind the overall interests of party and state work ; and have thus made fresh headway in all sorts of work .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government have extensively mobilized people in various circles to take a positive part in maintaining public order , and judicial , procuratorial , and public security organs have scrupulously performed their duties in protecting the environment of public security , thus ensuring political and social stability in the capital .  
Party committees and governments at various levels , as well as judicial , procuratorial , and public security organs , have been paying close attention to problems concerning social stability and public order .  As the " Falun Gong " cult organization has kept doing damage to society and the situation in public order has not been so optimistic , Beijing Municipality has adopted a series of effective work methods and measures to cope with the situation .  Now the municipality has established a whole set of operating mechanisms for maintaining social stability and public order .

Under the principle of " One Country , Two Systems " , the socialist system and policies are not practiced in Hong Kong , and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged .  The HKSAR enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  
To ensure that the District Court would be able to cope with the proposed increase to the various jurisdictional limits without affecting service in terms of court waiting time for cases to be heard , the Chief Justice has tasked a working group to examine possible procedural changes having regard to modern trends and judicial practices .  Any legislative changes considered necessary will be introduced in the context of the revision of the District Court civil procedural rules .

In examining the statutory provisions in the laws of Hong Kong , the Government has also identified 28 statutory bodies which exercise quasi judicial functions and which for the time being have practical and operational difficulty in accepting electronic submission in their proceedings under their respective legislation .  
In accordance with the Basic Law , we have established the HKSAR Government and realised the principles of " One Country , Two Systems " , " Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " .  Our lifestyle and social system remain unchanged .  The well established executive , legislative and judicial systems continue to function effectively .  Hong Kong society continues with its smooth and steady development .  
The Basic Law is the constitutional law of the HKSAR . It stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR , including the social and economic systems , the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems , and the relevant policies .  
I am pleased to note that some Hong Kong lawyers have taken the initiative to develop a better understanding of the Mainland 's legal system .  It is being done with a view to ensuring that issues affecting both jurisdictions will be handled properly , all the while protecting the integrity of Hong Kong 's separate legal and judicial systems .  
The Basic Law particularly provides that the socialist system and policies shall not be practised in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged ; the social and economic systems , the system for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its residents , the executive , legislative and judicial systems and the relevant policies shall be based on the provisions of the Basic Law .  
" These include our dedication to maintaining our status as a free port , high transparency of laws and regulations , an impartial legal and judicial system , a free flow of information , a capable civil service as well as a clean government free of corruption , " he added .  
So far as the legal system was concerned , the Joint Declaration provided that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would be vested with independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication .  It stated that the laws then in force would remain basically unchanged .

" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
The Chief Justice said , " Before the Administration makes any decision on the Judiciary 's proposal ( which includes statutory prohibition of reduction in judicial remuneration in line with numerous jurisdictions ) , it would be inappropriate for the Administration to evade the issue by further cutting the Judiciary 's budget by an amount equivalent to the amount involved if judicial remuneration were reduced back to the levels as at 1 July 1997 .  
Some public housing tenants have recently expressed certain demands in connection with the judicial review .  Since their demands are closely linked to the Authority 's decision to appeal , the Authority therefore decided this morning that upon conclusion of the legal proceedings and clear judgment from the court on the proper interpretation and implementation of the relevant legal provisions , it would proceed to review its domestic rent policy and identify a satisfactory arrangement for rent adjustment immediately in accordance with the law . "  
At a joint meeting of Legislative Council 's Panel on Planning , Lands and Works and Panel on Environmental Affairs this ( October 13 ) afternoon , some members expressed that the Government and its legal representatives had led the court to believe that reclamation was not irreversible and the Government would suffer huge financial losses if the court ordered the work be stopped pending the outcome of a judicial review .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations .

At the end of every year it issues its " indices of human rights in Taiwan . " The association 's Chai Song-lin says that this year Taiwan earned failing marks in all eight categories of human rights : political , children 's , elderly , economic , judicial , educational-cultural , social and women 's rights .

The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "

The establishment of such a tribunal must be based upon a careful and comprehensive examination of all the complex political , legal and judicial elements involved .  
In our view , a viable judicial system , supported by an effective civil and police administration , would in the short run assist the Government to put Rwanda back on its feet and enable it to pursue the goals of social and economic development .  
One representative recommended that , when dealing with international cooperation on judicial matters , the Commission should bear in mind the various statements reflecting changing international legal thinking on the subject .  
While it is true that without a judicial body responsible for implementing and enforcing it , a code would be superfluous , it is also true that without a prior strict definition of the applicable law , a court would be merely an ineffectual body .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;  
At the theoretical level , it was more logical for an international judicial body which was impartial , independent and representative of the international community to make such a determination .  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ,  
The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ;

As regards judicial guarantees , the view was expressed that article 8 , which represented the bare minimum , should include the full range of generally recognized principles , arranged by categories , as established in international or regional instruments .  
In its opinion , the Committee first observed that if members of a jury were suspected of displaying or voicing racial bias against an accused , it was incumbent upon the judicial authorities of the State party concerned to investigate the issue and to disqualify the juror , if there was a suspicion that the juror might be biased .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Under such circumstances , the Court , fully aware of its responsibilities as an integral part of the system of peaceful settlement of international disputes established under the Charter , has displayed judicial realism and has considered itself obligated to assist in bringing the parties closer together , while not at any time departing from its primary task of applying the law .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
We have drawn this issue to the attention of the Security Council , and we are confident that as a result urgent action at the national , regional and international levels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization and cooperation in the judicial , police and even intelligence spheres , in order to halt this insidious manifestation of terror .  
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .  
Since the completion of the previous report , the Special Rapporteur has received information of more instances of the judicial system failing to take effective measures to identify and punish those responsible for crimes and to provide families and relatives of Serbian victims with proper legal responses to the death or disappearance of their relatives .  
Her Office 's assessment of the situation was that it was easier to work to have rape classified as a public crime than to try to reverse the burden of proof requirement , which involved going against the entrenched judicial , religious , social and cultural prejudices which came into play whenever such a debate arose in Bolivia .  
Calls on all parties concerned to respond positively to the initiatives for dialogue and negotiations to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in conformity with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter , which calls for the settlement of disputes through negotiation , mediation and judicial procedures , and calls for a fair and impartial trial of the two suspects in a neutral country to be agreed upon by all the parties concerned ;  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
In particular , many delegations noted with satisfaction that by establishing a system of international criminal jurisdiction based primarily on the consent of the States concerned with the alleged crime and complementary to existing national jurisdictions and procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters , the draft reconciled the need for an international criminal court and respect for State sovereignty .  
It was noted that neither the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in some national legislation nor the mechanism of international judicial cooperation was sufficient to achieve the said objective and that , while it was incumbent on Governments to bring such individuals to justice , the international community could complement and assist national efforts , in particular in situations where authorities were not in a position to maintain law and order .  
One representative drew attention to the fact that , increasingly , national courts were enforcing international legal instruments for punishing perpetrators of international crimes and that it should , therefore , not be felt that the granting of universal jurisdiction to national courts and judicial cooperation among States for the purpose of the administration of justice would no longer be valid after the establishment of the Court .  
Unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women undermine women 's access to full and equal rights .  
It is requested that an international judicial fact-finding mission be formed within 30 days ; it shall be composed of competent and impartial persons to investigate the coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at of 21 October 1993 and what the political partners have agreed to call genocide without prejudice to the outcome of the independent national and international investigations , as well as the various political crimes that have been committed since October 1993 .  Article 37 .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
After the full and final reimbursement of all accepted claims from eligible participating Governments in the Unified Task Force , the balance of individual contributions remaining in the fund was transferred , according to the wishes of the contributing countries , to the two sub-accounts established for the support of the Somali police force and judicial and penal systems , and for the support of UNOSOM II forces , or returned to the contributor .  
Under constitutional systems based on the separation of judicial power , a central element in an offence could not be left to be conclusively determined by an international executive agency such as the Security Council .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
[ Create , fund , and improve ] or develop the training of judicial , legal , medical , social , educational and police and immigration personnel , as appropriate , in order to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and sensitize such personnel to the nature of gender-based acts and threats of violence so that fair treatment of female victims can be assured ;  
The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
In governmental systems , this is the basic infrastructure for the exercise of legitimate authority : a legal system , a judicial system , a police system , a prison system for those who act outside the law , and the design of governmental institutions that ensure informed , voluntary choice by the citizens .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;  
The task entrusted to me was that of determining , on the one hand , whether the relevant national entities in Burundi are prepared to institute a commission on the truth similar to the one set up in El Salvador ; and , on the other , whether a judicial fact-finding commission could be established as an alternative to a commission on the truth .  
Deeply concerned by the situation in Rwanda 's prisons and judicial system , particularly overcrowding , the lack of judges , detention of minors and elderly prisoners , and absence of speedy judicial or administrative review of charges , and in this respect , welcoming renewed efforts by the United Nations and donor countries , in coordination with the Government of Rwanda , to initiate , on an urgent basis , measures to improve this situation ,

Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]  
Pursuant to article 17 of the statute , it is responsible for the Tribunal 's administration but also for setting up the infrastructure required to ensure the proper functioning of the judicial process in a particularly sensitive and important area of criminal law .  
While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices perpetuate women 's de facto inequality .  
At the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited .

Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
If an international crime was to be designated as a qualified case of an international breach of law , there was a need for a special regime governing State responsibility , which must include a set of legal consequences going beyond the consequences of ordinary wrongful acts and which must put the instrumental consequences of the crime under the supervision of a judicial authority .  
After the full and final reimbursement of all accepted claims from eligible participating Governments in the Unified Task Force , the balance of individual contributions remaining in the fund was transferred , according to the wishes of the contributing countries , to the two sub-accounts established for the support of the Somali police force and judicial and penal systems , and for the support of UNOSOM II forces .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .

note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
While the former limitations are constant , being structural , and in principle could be removed only at the cost of a distortion of the judicial function or a profound transformation of the political environment in which it is performed , the latter are reversible , but have the drawback of being extremely unpredictable . 
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .

Perhaps the most accurate picture of the true human rights situation in the United States was to be found in its judicial and penitentiary system , where 1.5-million persons filled the prisons of that country , which had the highest rate of imprisonment and the largest juvenile penal system in the world .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
FENG Cui ( China ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the representatives of the United States and the European Union had attacked the Chinese Government in their statements and made unfounded allegations , interfering in China 's internal affairs , maligning its judicial system and claiming that China practised torture , misused the death sentence and restricted freedom of speech .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
The following questions , among others , were considered : protection of aboriginal people , including land claims and self-government ; protection against discrimination with respect to race and sex ; assistance programmes for minorities ; incorporation in human rights legislation of more explicit reference to economic , social and cultural rights ; judicial control over administrative decisions ; and differences between provincial and federal legislation in the field of human rights .

SRIWIDJAJA ( Indonesia ) said it was vital that the jurisdiction of the international criminal court should be universally accepted , and he concurred with the view that the court should be established as an independent judicial organ by means of a multilateral treaty , as recommended by the International Law Commission .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
Several representatives reported that new structures had been set up to strengthen the office of the Attorney-General in their respective States to investigate and take action against criminal organizations , while others reported the adoption of measures to make judicial cooperation more flexible and transparent , particularly with regard to extradition and mutual assistance . 
Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law , the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country .

There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
Member States were invited to accord priority to the practical implementation of standards relating to human rights in the administration of justice , to incorporate into their national legislation and practice existing standards in this field , to design realistic and effective mechanisms for the full implementation of those standards , and to provide the necessary administrative and judicial structures for their continuous monitoring .

" 
As stated by a number of members , " it was preferable to designate a specific conduct of States as criminal and to regulate the consequences through judicial review and the introduction of substantive rules to spare the population of the criminal State extreme hardship rather than to leave that whole area unregulated , concealing the punitive element under the guise of restitution or guarantees against repetition .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .  NULL  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .

Malta agreed that in order to combat the growing international character of terrorism there was need for enhanced international cooperation , particularly through the exchange of information , the effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and the conclusion of reciprocal judicial assistance and extradition agreements at the bilateral , regional and multilateral levels .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
In these circumstances , as announced in Declaration 1 / 88 of 18 September 1988 , the Armed Forces established martial law , overturning the Constitution of 1974 , dissolved all State organs , including the Pyithu Hluttaw ( People 's Assembly ) and the State Council . The Armed Forces constituted for itself the State Law and Order Council ( SLORC ) which assumed all legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
Among these indicators , the following should figure : substantial and regular respect for the right to life and physical integrity exercised by public agents of the Republic of Rwanda ; effective functioning of the judicial system at all levels ; conformity of arrest and detention practices with international human rights standards ; and humane conditions of detention throughout Rwanda .  
It was emphasized that there is no bureaucratic leadership at the top level within the system , which means that " the political system created is not an organization , but all the powers ( legislative , executive and judicial ) together , there is no budget allocated to this system ( enacted bodies are financed by self-resources by the constituency ) , there is a face-to-face democracy , that is a free gathering of all citizens in different neighbourhoods , citizens who enjoy full equality of their rights " .  
This positive development now makes judicial corporal punishment for ordinary crimes a historical relic and may be expected substantially to reduce the incidence of such cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments .

However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
Engage in systematic exchange of information and consider effective implementation of relevant international conventions , including the harmonization of their domestic legislation with those conventions , and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral or regional basis and other measures for the purpose of combating offences referred to in article 2 of this Convention ;  
Efforts should continue for the establishment of an international criminal court to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the most serious crimes against humanity , the worst war criminals and the worst violators of human rights , who went unpunished as a result of defunct or seriously flawed judicial systems and pro domo amnesty laws .  
Regrettably , where alleged violations of minority rights occurred , political means were frequently resorted to and there was an insufficient use of judicial protection mechanisms at the national level , which should be exhausted before any recourse was had to the relevant international organizations .

Please indicate the measures undertaken , including of a legislative , administrative and judicial nature , to recognize the right of the child who has been placed by the competent authorities for the purposes of care , protection or treatment of his or her physical and mental health , to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child in public and private institutions , services and facilities , as well as all other circumstances relevant to his or her placement . 
Relevant bilateral , regional and multilateral agreements concluded or to which the State party may have acceded to foster the prevention of all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation and to ensure the effective protection of child victims , including in the areas of judicial cooperation and cooperation among law enforcement officials ;  
The question is limited to a small number of individual and isolated cases in which the offenders are held accountable and punished , in case the investigation and the judicial verdict prove it , in the light of the State 's desire to ensure the enforcement of the law while showing no indulgence towards offenders of the crime of torture , as reflected in the detailed replies of the Egyptian authorities to the Committee .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
Against this background , the Belgian Government supported the establishment of specialized reception centres to provide social , psychological and medical assistance to the victims , as well as legal assistance within the framework of judicial proceedings begun against the guilty parties .  
The right of a detained or imprisoned person to be visited by and to consult and communicate , without delay or censorship and in full confidentiality , with his legal counsel may not be suspended or restricted save in exceptional circumstances , to be specified by law or lawful regulations , when it is considered indispensable by a judicial or other authority in order to maintain security and good order .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
There should be a specific provision in the operative part of the statute devoted to the principle of complementarity which would define the nature and scope of cooperation between the court and national judicial systems , and the obligation of States parties to cooperate with the court in an effective and speedy manner .  
In order to deal more effectively with juvenile delinquency , the French Government has launched the urban recovery pact , which includes a set of new judicial measures coordinated around three basic aims : speeding up the course of penal justice for minors , diversifying educational measures and improving the consistency of juvenile delinquency prevention measures . 
Support for a culture of democracy has proved critical to success in holding free and fair elections in which all actors in society - government officials , political leaders , parliamentarians , judicial officials , police and military forces and individual citizens - play their accorded roles .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
The integrity and efficiency of the judicial function fulfil the task of guaranteeing the rules of social relations , a guarantee which can become operative only if there is security , as manifested in the substantive rights prescribed by law , the fair settlement of disputes , universal respect for procedural norms , the punishment of offenders and reparation for injury .  
The establishment and functioning of the Commission on the Strengthening of the Justice System should provide the country with a historic opportunity to undertake , based on a broad debate , a judicial reform that meets society 's tremendous need for an independent , professionally sound justice system which can restore public confidence .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
Statements were made that judicial cooperation in general , including cooperation in insolvency matters , was governed by bilateral or multilateral treaties , which typically provided for cooperation based on reciprocity .  For some States it was doubtful whether a workable framework for judicial cooperation could be established exclusively by way of a national statute , in particular since it was difficult to incorporate in it the concept of reciprocity .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
Much of the populace has accepted Taliban rule not , I would say , because they want a severe judicial regime or social and religious restrictions imposed on all , but because they are desperate for peace and a semblance of normal life .  
Recognizes that institutions responsible for sustaining the rule of law play an important role in removing the causes of mass exoduses and , in this context , calls on the High Commissioner to continue his efforts , at the request of the Governments concerned , to reinforce national legal , judicial and administrative capacity , including training opportunities through technical cooperation programmes in countries of origin as well as host countries , particularly developing countries ;  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
This article _ which the bulk of legal doctrine considers as jus cogens _ requires the observance of judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples during a civil war and , in the light of case law arising from international conflicts , should apply all the more so when the threat to the life of the nation is less serious .  
The keystone to an effective legal system is an independent judiciary operating in an environment in which judicial personnel are well trained and the general public is educated and knowledgeable about the law and judicial processes .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .

Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
An effective human rights regime , secured by institutions that support the rule of law , including an independent judicial system accessible to all and an accountable public administration , is also of paramount importance for the creation of a stable society and thus conducive to consolidating peace and preventing the recurrence of mass exodus .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .  
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .  
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
Another significant event in the international community 's quest to apply the rule of law in relations between States in marine affairs was the successful completion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of its judicial organizational phase , despite operating with a modest budget and a tiny staff under its President , Thomas Mensah .  
Beginning in October 1996 , the Act has been the subject of an energetic explanatory and awareness _ raising campaign directed at all sectors of the Rwandan population : the administration and the public , urban and rural sectors , judicial and prison personnel and detainees .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
The State has the responsibility to take legislative , judicial , administrative or other appropriate measures to promote the understanding by all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
And yet , in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system , compounded by the climate of political instability , more should be done if the international community \ x { e5b8 } hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible .  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Furthermore , my Office 's overall efforts towards the economic reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina , functioning common institutions and the improvement of the overall human rights , policing and judicial situation can be expected to have beneficial effects for the provision of durable solutions for displaced persons and returning refugees .  
These measures have included reliance on indirect taxes , reliance on declarations and withholding of taxes by third parties , the operation of an efficient system and cross-checking of information , auditing and the unilateral determination of taxable income , the bilateral determination of taxable income ( forfeit method ) and the use of legislative provision administrative rulings and judicial decisions , as well as the enactment and enforcement of penalties .  
The European Union welcomes the formal undertaking by the Belarus authorities to initiate consultations with all the deputies of the elected thirteenth Supreme Soviet to establish a proper balance between the functions and duties of the members of the legislative , executive and judicial powers , as well as devise mechanisms that would strengthen respect for human rights and the position of the independent media .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
The establishment of a workable and effective system of cooperation between the court and States was of crucial importance for the effectiveness of the court , and the statute should contain explicit provisions on the matter that drew on existing structures and practice in international judicial cooperation .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
In its second Advisory Opinion , the Inter-American Court stated that the ' essential ' judicial guarantees that are not subject to derogation according to article 27 include habeas corpus , amparo , and any other effective remedy before judges or competent tribunals which is designed to guarantee respect for the rights and freedoms whose suspension are not authorized by the American Convention .  
Amongst the harsh realities faced by many returnees are fragile security , the presence of landmines , inadequate judicial processes , threats to governmental authority from rebel groups and the destruction of economic , social and legal infrastructures .  
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his solemn and urgent appeal to the Burundian authorities to defer the 38 death sentences and 19 sentences of life imprisonment handed down during the February-March , April-May and July-August sessions of the criminal chambers , as well as the previous 133 death sentences and 54 sentences of life imprisonment , at least until the peace negotiations have been completed and a reformed judicial system , capable of playing its role with complete independence and impartiality , has been established .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .

Liberalization needed to be combined with sound and coherent domestic economic policies , the creation of effective judicial systems , the promotion of the rule of law and respect for the regulatory responsibility of Governments .  
For non _ international armed conflicts , the elements of the offence are only met when the combined violations of penal provisions rise to the level of denying indispensable judicial guarantees recognized by all civilized peoples .  
The widely prevailing view had been that a model national statute , or set of legislative provisions , would be appropriate to give judicial cooperation a clearer legal framework .

With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .

A strong and independent judiciary is unthinkable in any political system other than a genuine democracy in which there is a clear separation of the three state powers : the executive , the legislative and the judicial .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .

At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
b .

Without prejudice to articles ( 14 and 19 ) of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation1 ] .

The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .

Without prejudice to articles [ 14 and 19 ] of this Convention , ensure that administrative , regulatory , law enforcement and other authorities dedicated to combating money-laundering ( including , where appropriate under domestic law , judicial authorities ) have the ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international levels [ within the conditions prescribed by its domestic legislation60 ] .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .
