All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .  Xinjiang situated along the northwestern border of the country is an important part of large-scale development in the western region , which will have a bearing on the overall situation in economic development .  
The officers and men of the PLA and the Armed Police Force comply with the word " absolute " not only in normal times but also and particularly when dealing with major issues of right and wrong and when performing urgent , arduous and risky tasks .  When entering Hong Kong and Macao , they won glory for the country .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .

Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
China is a country with dense population and little cultivated land .  For a considerably long period of time , it will be difficult to change the basic trend in which population is increasing , and cultivated land is decreasing .  We must regard the protection of cultivated land as one of the major affairs affecting the national economy and the people 's livelihood as well as the country 's sustainable development , and must never slacken efforts in grasping it at any time .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
In the light of glorious achievements attained in military logistical building and reform in the past decade , leaders from the logistics departments of major military units and the Armed Police Corps as well as experts and scholars from some universities and institutes had an in-depth discussion .  Their discussion focused on the epochal background for Chairman Jiang to give major expositions on logistical work , and characteristics and guiding position of his theory .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .

The broad policies and specific principles for reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty have been clearly laid down by the central authorities and all major policy measures have been promulgated .  The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
During the three major political struggles last year in particular , the educational leadership role of the news media was given full play , and waves of resistance to foreign aggression , protection of sovereignty , opposition of splittism , and strengthening of China were set off .  A healthy atmosphere in the whole society opposing superstition and resisting heretical teachings formed .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
A naval guided missile escort boat formation conducted offensive and defensive battles for five days and nights amid misty rains and heavy waves in certain waters in the East China Sea in mid July .

The professors revealed that Harbin Institute of Engineering has all along played a major role in our country 's deep-dive lifesaving research .  Our country 's deep-dive lifeboats are now equipped with a dynamic orientation system developed by the institute .  At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
First , inflation was successfully restrained , and " soft landing " of the economy was smoothly implemented ; then , the tendency of deflation was effectively checked , and a major turning point was brought about in economic growth .

The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
Party organizations , governments , and departments in charge at all levels are required to inspect their work on a regular basis , including major incidents , emergencies , heavy economic losses , persons and affairs which have aroused strong resentment among the masses , as well as problems with relation to the families of leading cadres .  Based on the results of supervision and inspection , any party-member leading cadres found to be involved should be dealt with according to relevant responsibility affixation stipulations ;  
seriously put into practice all the major strategic policy-decisions of the party Central Committee ; given wide publicity to the main melody of our time in line with the work arrangements made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government and in the light of Sichuan 's realistic conditions ; and have done a great deal of work and achieved sound work results in boosting both the economic development growth and an all-round social progress in our province .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
It is a pressing and important task with high requirements to conduct admonitory education with the serious cases of Cheng Kejie and Hu Changqing . Party committees at all levels must take admonitory education as a major political task , and fulfill this task by doing intensive and effective work with a strong sense of political responsibility , sufficient energy for exercising leadership , and a soaring morale and healthy mentality , thus guaranteeing that admonitory education achieve expected solid results .

Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .

APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .

It will equip with highly mobile armored combat vehicles .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
Indeed , by issuing the above circular , the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom Industries has made a major move to rectify order on China 's telecommunication market , and to prevent external forces , especially those in the radio , movie , and television sector , from making a roundabout entry into the market .  Given this , it seems that China 's program for " merging three networks " has an uncertain future .  
When being interviewed by this reporter , Yu Zhengsheng , minister of construction , stressed that at present , the dynamism and competitiveness of the construction industry and the real estate industry should be enhanced through structural adjustments , industrial policies , and the work of straightening out and regularizing the order of the construction market , and efforts must be made to turn the construction industry into one of the pillar industries and major economic growth points of the national economy .  
According to analysis , the Code Red II virus is a vicious virus which produces disastrous consequences .  This type of virus spreads fast .  It can block communications on networks and paralyze servers .  It contains a remote control hacker program .  The virus is mainly a threat to local area networks , business networks , and Internet users with Windows 2000 or NT operating systems .  However , it does not have the major effect on countries ' entire network systems , which it was recently rumored to have .  
From now on , China 's public security sector will take it as a major task to crack down on and give punishment to criminal activities that endanger the information network security , such as invading computer information systems in key areas and deliberately creating and disseminating computer viruses to undermine computer programs and jeopardize computer systems and information networks .  They will gear up the investigative effort in this field so as to prevent the spread of network-related crimes .  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
It was revealed that the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . discovered that its major shareholders and the parties concerned had misappropriated a huge amount of funds , equivalent to 96 percent of its listed net assets , even more than what some major shareholders had misappropriated from " ST Monkey King " during a period of many years .  In this astonishing case , it can be said , the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . has set a vicious example for major shareholders and the parties concerned to misappropriate funds from a listed company .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year . "  
What is worse , in so doing , major shareholders have seriously violated the principle of " being open , fair , and impartial , " namely , a principle governing the stock market , and have directly encroached upon small and medium-sized investors ' legitimate rights and interests as well .  
Now that the CSCC has decided to place on file for investigation and prosecution both the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . and the people involved in its irregularities , circulating a notice criticizing the relevant law-violation and rule-violation behaviors , this has signaled a major move made by China 's securities control authorities aimed at restructuring listed companies in terms of management , and has demonstrated China 's securities control authorities ' firm resolve in ruthlessly cracking down on irregularities in the stock market as well .  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
We must perceive the major political , economic , cultural , and science and technology changes that have taken place in the world since the publication of the " Communist Manifesto " 150 years ago ; we must perceive the major changes that have occurred in China 's socialist construction ; and we must perceive the major changes that have taken place in the working and living conditions and social environment of the party members , cadres , and masses .  
After Jiang Zemin spoke , Zhang Wannian said that Chairman Jiang 's important speech was imbued throughout with Marxist world-view and methodology and filled with the truth-seeking and innovative spirit of emancipating the mind and moving with the times ; its political , theoretical , ideological , and targeted properties were extremely strong , it has further pointed out the orientation for the whole party and the whole army to study in depth and implement the 1 July speech and fully implement the demands of the " three represents , " and is of major guiding significance .  
The Shuguang 2000-II SuperServer is a major achievement in the State 863 Project and in the knowledge innovation project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Effecting major breakthroughs in its key technologies and in realizing its production , this super-server has attained the advanced level that similar products in the world attained at the end of the 1990 ' s , and has already edged into the international leading ranks in terms of machine operation systems .  
The main duties of this office under the leadership group are : to look into and put forward proposals regarding the strategy , development plans , major issues , and relevant policies and rules and regulations for west China development , and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development there ;  
to look into and put forward proposals regarding rural economic development , key infrastructure construction , protection and building of the ecological environment , restructuring , resource exploitation , and the arrangement of major projects , and to organize and coordinate the enactment and implementation of plans for returning farmland to forest ( grassland ) ;  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
On 12 February , Renmin Ribao carried a commentator 's article entitled " All Members of Society Should Concern Themselves With and Give Support to Education Undertakings . " The article discussed the situation from the strategic high plane of national destiny and reinvigoration .  It said that correctly guiding young students and helping them grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
Over the past year , CPC disciplinary-enforcement and law-enforcement organs at all levels exposed , investigated , and took actions against a number of major cases characterized by high-ranking officials , huge amounts of money , large numbers of people involved , hidden methods of crime , complicated situations , and rather vicious effects on public perceptions ;  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
To the common people of China , perhaps the reform of the budget planning method has no specific links to their everyday life , but in reality , this reform , which stems from the practical demand of intensifying economic and budgetary supervision , can bring major benefits to the broad masses of the people .  That is , systems-wise , the government 's actions will be standardized , and the fulcrum of forces needed to build a clean government and oppose corruption will be strengthened .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
Zhou Tianyong also believed that while China has attained tremendous achievements in its economic development in recent years , a number of deep-seated contradictions have gradually manifested themselves .  Nevertheless , thanks to its timely major readjustments in many fields , China has been able to meet the various indexes set for its national economic reform , development , and stability under an extremely complicated situation both inside and outside the country .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
ensured the development of two major industries , such as agriculture and animal husbandry and the telecommunications industry ; downsized such industries as retail marketing , international trade , real estate , petrochemical , auto , and motor vehicle manufacturing industries ; and supported the development of major industries by selling stock rights and recovering parts of the investment .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .

In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
These lifetime revolutionary companions who were born in the same month of the same year were well-experienced and loyal communist soldiers and outstanding proletariat revolutionaries ; they made major indelible contributions to China 's revolution and developmental undertakings .  
However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
Following investigation , the discipline inspection and supervision departments of Chongqing Municipality maintained that former Fendu Country Secretary Gao Rongmiao , being the principal person responsible for improving the party 's work style and ensuring honest government administration , was negligent of management and supervision and that he is held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  
Li Renfu , former head of Fendu County and incumbent deputy county secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  Besides , he also violated regulations in accepting " awards " and cash gifts .  He was dismissed from the posts as deputy secretary , member of the standing committee , and member , of the county party committee .  
Huang Faxiang 's wife Chen Zhiqiong , former Fengdu County deputy secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in issuing awards at random by the Fengdu County Financial Bureau and Local Taxation Bureau . She also violated regulations in accepting enormous amounts of " awards " and cash gifts , and in illegally allowing her husband to use 15,000 yuan of public funds .  She was expelled from the party .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
2 .  It has vigorously developed multiple forms of commercial personal insurance as a major supplement for social security , which has played an important role in raising the social security level , and instituting and perfecting a social security system in China .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
Sensing the seriousness of the matter after repeatedly receiving information about the terrorist attacks , the Security Bureau immediately called meetings with the Police Department . A special task force formed by ten departments was assigned to handle the matter .  The Immigration Department was instructed to keep a close watch on Arabs entering the territory and to pass on to the Security Bureau all materials regarding the suspects .  So far no major suspects have been discovered , but the alert has not been called off .

Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .

Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .  
If the four major changes can be realized , China will see enormous changes .  It will become a country that has accomplished modernization on the whole , and the ideal of building a powerful country and bringing prosperity to the people pursued by the kind and upright men will be preliminarily achieved as well .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .

What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .

Implementing the great development of the west and speeding up the development of central and west China will open new and broader scope for China 's economic development in the 21st century ; it is a major strategic measure for maintaining China 's sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development and is of great significance for the country 's prosperity and long-lasting stability .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Viewed from another angle , if you do n't want to appraise in a most constructive , diversified and flexible way the reality that a political party and its leaders voluntarily proposed the policy of allowing a country to have two social and political systems and even two armies with their own commanders and that this policy won popular support , at least , you should believe that this country and its people have sufficient wisdom and ability to handle major issues of the state .  
At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .  The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .

He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
The two countries have maintained close political contacts and consultations , and have brought about a constant growth to their economic relations and trade ; what is more , our two countries have reached agreements on a number of major cooperative projects during a recent period , and this will surely produce a far-reaching influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries .  
China and Germany share same or similar views on a series of major international issues , their economies are highly complementary , and a wide-ranging cooperation has already been established in all fields which enjoys a solid foundation .  Therefore , a further development to our friendly relations enjoys huge potentials and a broad prospect .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
After the all-out civil war broke out , the party again made in a timely fashion a set of correct policy decisions in light of the major changes taking place in the situation at home and abroad , which helped achieve victory in the war of liberation and found New China .

5 .

The meeting of the five countries ' heads of state held on 5 July in Dushanbe is a major event in the history of the Eurasian continent .  The " Dushanbe Statement " signed jointly by the five countries ' heads of state marks an excellent beginning of cooperation among the five countries in the new century which fully reflects the common wishes of the people of the five countries to be always friendly toward each other and to become eternal " good neighbors , good partners , and good friends .

Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The Chinese Communist Party believes that the guiding role of the state-owned economy is mainly embodied in its ability to control .  The state-owned economy should have a dominant role in key areas and major industries which are the lifeline of the national economy .  Other areas can have adjustments such as " advance and retreat " and " let some things go undone , " with the proportion which is the state-owned economy reduced somewhat with no effect on the socialist nature of China .  
Most of the major economic indicators broke out of the downward trend that had persisted for many years , with exports growing strongly , consumption expenditure rising , fixed assets investment having moved out of the trough , and all of the three major types of demand that drive the economy seeing growth .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .

To avoid the possible economic downturn and to maintain sustained rapid healthy national economic development , the central authorities have resolutely made major policy decisions to expand domestic demand and implement the proactive fiscal policy .  
all this has affected the efficiency of the funds from the issue of government bonds .  In the management of state-owned enterprises , the efficiency of such enterprises is improved , and fresh achievements have been made in reducing losses and increasing profits ; however , major accidents concerning safety have occurred one after another , and internal factors such as changing enterprises ' operating mechanism and improving their management are to be strengthened .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .

They advocate that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means , and that relations between states should be developed on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .

This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .

Yang Jiechi noted : The Chinese Government has assigned great importance to Sino-US relations , and is willing to , on the basis of the principles laid down in the three Sino-US communiques , work together with the US side to enhance mutual understanding , seek common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor ones , expand the scope of cooperation , and bring about a healthy and stable development to the relations of the two countries in the new century .  
Some senior central officials even feel that by changing the " 4 June incident " from " upheaval " to " disturbance , " Jiang Zemin 's political attitude toward such a major political incident , whose nature has been determined by the central authorities , is equivocal and will encourage political opposition and the trend of bourgeois liberalization .  
Many facts show that " Falungong " has all major features of a modern evil cult .  What it did seriously harmed the physical and mental health of the practitioners , infringed upon the interests of the masses , and gravely disrupted our country 's economic construction , social order , and political stability .  
It has been learned that since the Third Session of the Ninth National CPPCC Committee , CPPCC members , all democratic parties and relevant mass organizations have exercised their functions as CPPCC members by raising motions around the major issues cropping up in the course of China 's economic and social development , and the hot-point issues which the people are concerned about .

Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .

He said that since the Third Session , centering on major issues in China 's economic and social development and hot issues of concern to the masses , the CPPCC members , democratic parties , and relevant popular bodies have exercised their CPPCC functions in the form of raising motions and actively contributed schemes and ideas ; altogether they have raised 3,733 motions , 3,372 of which have been placed on file , and 361 of which have been converted into members ' letters for handling .

" They support the government 's crack down on cults in accordance with the law to eliminate public nuisance and engage in firm struggles against the " Falungong " in various ways .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
To do this , we must start from the standpoint of actual conditions in Guizhou , suiting measures to local conditions and giving full play to strong points while avoiding weaknesses , facing the market and actively adjusting economic structures , relying on science and technology , and devoting major efforts toward developing distinctive industries so as to transform the plethora of natural resources into an economic advantage .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Whether we are drawing up policy for economic , social , or cultural development ; publishing a major reform measure ; or making laws , regulations , or rules , we must take into consideration the endeavor to combat corruption and promote clean administration as an organic component and must conduct argumentation on whether they are conducive to combating corruption and promoting clean administration so as to effect prior prevention .  
The practice in the last two years showed that a major way to foster large enterprises with international competitive power is to select a batch of large-sized and super-sized enterprises for being listed in external capital markets after reorganization and restructuring .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring . 
In referring to this year 's economic situation , Zeng Peiyan said : Judging from the rate and efficiency , China saw a major favorable turn in economic growth last year .  We ended years of downward trend in economic growth rate and saw an upward trend in social demands .  Prices have become stable after a decline , and the quality of economic growth has been greatly improved .  
3 ) start 12 new and major projects , including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway , diverting gas from western China to eastern China , returning grain plots to forestry and grassland , and educational projects , with a total investment of 300 billion yuan ;  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
Li Peng said : The NPC Standing Committee must conscientiously exercise supervision over budgets and economic work in accordance with the law ; it must investigate , study , and put forward proposals on current major issues in the economic and social spheres , such as strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , increasing farmer income , reforming state-owned enterprises , increasing job opportunities , implementing the strategy of developing western regions on a massive scale , joining the World Trade Organization , and implementing the strategy of seeking sustainable development .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
All the armed forces stood up to the rigorous tests of complicated international and domestic situations as well as military and political struggles , always kept a high degree of stability , centralization , and unification , and accomplished with flying colors such tasks as conducting major military exercises , fighting floods and dealing with emergencies , holding a military review in celebration of the 50th founding anniversary of the PRC , and assuming the defense responsibilities in Hong Kong and Macao , making important contributions to defending and building the motherland .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
In view of the fact that the number of suspects of corruption , bribery , and misappropriation of public funds absconding with huge sums of money had increased in recent years , at the end of last year , the SPP and the Ministry of Public Security jointly organized a dedicated campaign for tracking down fugitives .  So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
This year , the " two supreme judicial organizations " will strengthen anti-corruption work and advocate honesty , severely punish crimes committed by state functionaries by taking advantage of their positions , attach importance to investigating and handling serious and major cases of corruption and bribery , abuse of power and dereliction of duties , and sternly crack down on sinister and vile forces so as to create favorable conditions for economic construction .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
This is a major and effective move which is adopted on the basis of both China 's national conditions and its practical situation , and which aims to speed up the process of socialist democracy .  From the agrarian reform to the introduction of a household-based contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and from the election of people 's deputies to the introduction of villagers ' self-rule , all have given an expression to the democratic practice that is being carried out by millions upon millions of people under the leadership of the party .  
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
cheating on taxes or foreign exchange , smuggling , or fraudulent bidding practices in the construction sector have run rampant ; cases of violating financial or economic disciplines have persisted despite repeated prohibitions ; and major , serious , or even fatal accidents relating to production safety have also time and again broken , and these have inflicted grave losses on the state interests or people 's life or property ;  
After the initial excitement subsided upon hearing Premier Zhu Rongji 's report on the outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which lists " new carrier rocket models , " " high-speed , broad-band information networks , " and " key integrated circuits " as three major high-tech projects that China will give priority to supporting over the next five years , he has been pondering these questions : New carrier rocket models seem to have very little to do with the lives of ordinary people .  Why are we paying so much attention to them ?  
In accordance with the domestic and international situation our nation is facing , the outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan sets forth the main objectives , guiding principles , and major tasks for economic and social development in our country , points out the orientation for our further advances , and gives expression to the fundamental interests and common wishes of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .

The southern part of Shaanxi will be developed into a diversified economic zone for developing biological resources , tourist resources , and water resources .  
Zhang Zhongwei also listed other major objectives for the province 's economic and social development in the coming five years : The average annual increase in the province 's financial income will slightly exceed its GDP growth .  
enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of industry ; speed up the development of such pillar industries as electronics and information , hydropower , machinery and metallurgy , medicine and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs ; and strive to build up eight major industrial bases for electronics and information , hydropower , heavy machinery and equipment , special steel products , new vanadium-titanium materials , modern Chinese medicine , natural gas and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs .  
Raidi said , in the 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , the people 's awareness of preserving the unity of the motherland and opposing ethnic separatism has been further enhanced , and major victories have been won in the struggle against separatism ; at present " the situation is stable , social progress is being made , and there is ethnic solidarity . "  
He added : To achieve the " two higher " objective " and effect restructuring in the five aspects , Henan will give prominence to following eight measures in the course of comprehensively advancing economic and social development : First , build two agricultural bases , turn Henan into the country 's major high-quality wheat production and processing base , and major animal product production and processing base .  
Fifth , quicken the transformation of roads , give priority to the construction of express highways , build up major transportation lines across the central plain , and turn Henan a major transportation hub between the north and the south and between the east and the west .  
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , especially since the beginning of reform and opening up , the party Central Committee and the State Council successively held three forums on Tibet 's work to specially assist Tibet in discussing and solving major problems concerning development and stability and in straightening out ideas .

Making suggestions on the medium - and long-term plans for national economic and social development is an effective mode of our party 's work in guiding economic construction , and also a concrete embodiment of the party 's system of democratic centralism in making major policy decisions .

They will exchange views with each other on the latest political and economic developments in their regions .  
As for the construction and engineering contracts , a major reason for single tendering was to avoid technical problems or contractual disputes that might arise from the employment of different contractors on the works .  Another main reason was that the works required were of extreme urgency : for example , the works had to be completed before the typhoon or rain season ; open tendering in these circumstances would delay the works and prejudice public or security interests .  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .

For exceptional cases where no alternative public transport service is available and there are identified genuine needs for a RS which has not been authorised by TD in the past , TD would consider formalising the operation of the relevant RS for operation to the nearby railway stations or major public transport interchanges . "  
( c ) In implementing individual IT application projects , the Government 's primary consideration is to meet the operational requirements of user departments and achieve cost effectiveness .  Therefore , nurturing the growth of local companies has not been set as a major objective in the implementation of such projects and we have not made any evaluation in this respect .  
While core infrastructure projects completed in the last five years have enhanced the competitive edge of Hong Kong as a major regional business and transportation hub , the HKSAR Government 's commitment to invest C $ 120 billion in future infrastructure developments will ensure that Hong Kong will continue to be a world-class business city with a pleasant living environment for its citizens and visitors .

It is also a main source of foreign investments for the province .  As of October this year , the number of investment projects in the province involving HK capitals has passed the 18,000 mark , with a total contracted investment of US $ 27 billion .  
* Better streets and pedestrian areas for all - we aim to provide better pedestrian facilities like electronic audible traffic signals by 2004 at all signalized crossings , tactile guide paths to connect major public transport interchanges and community facilities for people with disabilities , more lifts at footbridges and more extensive pedestrian areas in the coming decade .  
In view of the continued growth of cargo volume in the Pearl River Delta , the Economic Development and Labour Bureau has commissioned a study on Hong Kong Port - Master Plan 2020 ( HKP2020 ) to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development , including the location for major container terminal ports and related infrastructure up to the year 2020 .  
Four years from now , we expect the Mainland to have become more fully aligned with the rest of the world in trade and economic matters .  We must seize these opportunities to elevate Hong Kong from its traditional role as an intermediary to a major hub connecting the Mainland and the international markets .  We can do this by supporting the Mainland 's economic development and opening up of its economy .  At the same time , we will enhance our position as the financial and commercial centre of China .  
Leaders of the Central Government and Guangdong Province as well as the Chief Executive of Macau fully support the development of the PRD , including Macau , into a major modernised economic region through enhancing co-operation with Hong Kong . The region will be a production and manufacturing base , a centre of modern services such as logistics , professional and financial services , tourism and entertainment , communication as well as consumer and personal services . 
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .

" The major non-compliance of these samples were that they did not carry the required instructions on safe battery usage , such as ' Do not mix old and new batteries ' and ' Do not mix alkaline , standard ( carbon-zinc ) , or rechargeable ( nickel-cadmium ) batteries ' .  The battery compartment was not marked to show the correct battery polarity and voltage .  
Apart from partnerships with local stakeholders , the annual report gives an account of cooperation with regional and international organisations on protecting the environment .  It also looks ahead to major tasks in different aspects of the environment in the coming years .  
Mr Passow continued , " The criteria for all awards was based on conversations by the editorial staff with consultants from the major accounting and financial service firms who monitor direct international investment flows and the tracking by Euromoney 's editorial staff of public information on the dollar amounts of deals in the Asia Pacific area .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , accompanied by the Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr Joseph W P Wong , met representatives from major civil service unions and departmental consultative committees today ( September 24 ) .

In this era of globalisation , as the world 's freest economy and a premier international finance , shipping and business centre , Hong Kong maintains constant exchanges with other economies and major cities around the world .  Many of these have become our steadfast business partners .  These global connections are crucial to Hong Kong 's future .  We must push ahead in this direction to reinforce our global market network .  
The annual investment in major construction projects has totaled more than NT $ 10,000 million . However , being located on the earthquake belt in western Pacific , Taiwan is subject to frequent tremors . The National Science Council recognized the importance of seismic research in preventing and reducing earthquake damages .  
Manufacturers of electric wire and cables in Taiwan have built automatic plants to produce high quality continuous copper rod . Such a plant needs capitalization of US $ 5,000,000 . This continuous rod has a number of major characteristics : It is cost-saving . Each roll weighs 5 tons . Transportation costs and the tedious work of connection can be saved or reduced .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
Costing about NT $ 7.3 billion ( US $ 203 million ) and taking six years to construct , the railway was fully opened to traffic on Feb . 1 , 1980 . Traversing the mountainous region along the northeast coast of Taiwan , from Nanshenghu in Ilan County in the north to Tienpu in Hualien County in the south , the railway is part of the planned round-the-island system . It will play a major role in boosting the economy and tourism on the under-developed east coast of Taiwan as well as strengthening national defense .  
Additionally , the government has prepared a " major program for developing the bastion of national revival " to expedite simultaneous implementation of medium-range and long-range economic , social and cultural plans over the next 10 years . "  
Precision machinery and instruments , electronic , optical , metal , plastic , electrical , chemical and rubber products , machinery , cosmetics , leather products , toys , yachts and mobile homes , garments , medical instruments and appliances , sporting goods , musical instruments , educational materials and communications equipment are the major products of factories in the EPZs .  
According to statistics which appeared in a local paper , major political issues raised by candidates were the upgrading of the livelihood of farmers ; promotion of administrative reform ; raising of salaries of government officials , public functionaries and teachers ; increasing social welfare ; building more residential districts ; increasing benefits to workers ; improving traffic conditions ; providing better flood control measures ; and working generally for the good of the people .  
But the mainland has been isolated from the rest of the world for more than 30 years , and therefore is backward in industrial production . Its major exports are raw materials and labor-intensive products of low quality , while Taiwan exports semi-finished and finished products .  
Chu , a forthright , pragmatic man , wanted the proposed Mini Cathay to become the number one of its kind , so he went to Europe and studied the other major miniature exhibitions to acquire a practical understanding of the ins and outs of " miniature " design . Of all the miniature exhibition parks he visited , Chu felt that the exhibition in Holland was the most impressive .  
His first major task became road development . In order to fund the enormous task , Mayor Shu sought a loan from the provincial government . As the standard yearly appropriation for all public construction throughout the island is US $ 72,500,000 , officials of the provincial government were astounded when Mayor Shu requested five times that amount for a single city .  
This year , too , we are lowering personal and corporate income taxes , reducing tariffs , further relaxing restrictions on foreign investment , and increasing public investment , while the 14 major development projects will be moving from the planning stage into that of actual construction .  
According to statistical information concerning body build among the three major racial groupings ( the Mongoloid or yellow ; the Caucasian or white ; and the Negroid or black ) Caucasian males are , on average , 1 meter 77 centimeters tall ( 5 feet 10 inches ) at maturity while Caucasian females have an average height of 1 meter 65 centimeters ( 5 feet 5 inches ) at maturity .  
The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
These two types of flower arrangement - - the former outgoing and extroverted , the latter self-contemplating and introverted - - are highly befitting examples of two major , contrasting Chinese attitudes towards life ; specifically , the socially oriented thought of the Confucianists and the reclusively individualistic philosophy of the Taoists , respectively .  
As a result , all the trivial chores of running an embassy - - showing slides , cooking and serving dinner , fixing toilets , paying the water bills - - have to be handled by the ambassador and one or two assistants , in addition to their major duties of keeping themselves informed of the local situation , negotiating with local officials , and serving overseas nationals .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
During his eight years at Chinese opera school , Ma threw himself with total energy into mastering the techniques of this demanding art , and he became an instant stage success after his graduation in 1959 . Unfortunately , in the political context of the time , his aristocratic family background proved to be a major stumbling block in his artistic career .  
Concerning the four major topics of civilization , war , city , and nature , this noble leader of modern spirit continues his mental perception and reflection . . . . In such a work as ' Song of Time and Space - - Looking at the Canton-Kowloon Railway in the Distance , ' Lomen courageously uncovers the fate of the Chinese people . It 's moving and may be considered a classical work in the modern Chinese epic . "  
The major material for their paintings consisted of metal oxides , iron oxide being the most commonly used . The use of metal oxides could produce red , blue , and yellow colors , and if heated , the colors would multiply .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
ConclusionThe four major programs and eleven key areas reported on above are the most salient of the government 's current administrative plans , aimed in essence at outlining a blueprint for future national development , and I hope you will be unsparing in your criticism and suggestions with regard to any points that may be inappropriate .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung . The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Taiwan is situated on the border of two of the major regions into which entomologists divide the world , and its insects combine the special characteristics of both . In addition , the island was formed in geological isolation and evolved a number of unique in digenous species . Its butterfly specimens , as a result , are extremely rich and varied .  
The most important physical characteristics of the Mongoloid race are flat noses , prominent cheekbones , rather prominent eye sockets , straight black hair , tawny skin and slanted , or almond-shaped , eyes . There are thirteen major and minor characteristics in all , which will be examined in more detail in another article .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
What makes scientists even more worried is that acid rain can dissolve heavy metals , many of which are present in soil . Where for example aluminum is a major component of the soil , if the aluminum is dissolved it raises the concentration of heavy metal in the soil and will harm the root systems of plants . When it reaches a lake , the dissolved aluminum will turn into a granular colloid which damages the breathing systems of fish .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Water buffalos and Chinese cattle produce just enough to feed their calves , without any extra for people . Domestic livestock and poultry have always been a major source of animal protein , with the sole point in raising them being to fill our bellies . New , improved varieties with rapid growth , greater fecundity or better taste have won favor over time , and pure native strains that have n't been interbred have gradually declined in popularity or even face extinction .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
Opening International Doors : In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , situated on a quiet section of Chieh Shou Rd . , the phones in the international organizations department are constantly ringing , the staff is busily poring through documents , and officials involved in major diplomatic initiatives are streaming in and out , swinging open the thick wooden door .  
Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
Even more tragic is that over the past two year , with a strategy of doing low-cost contracting , Sampo has attained substantial sales for air conditioners there . Unfortunately , in so doing it evoked the envy of the Japanese industry . Matsushita and Mitsubishi , major manufacturers of the compressor , an essential part , cut the supply in half . " We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
Unwilling to bring production : In primitive times Puli was a vast lake ; later the water disappeared , leaving a basin filled with extremely rich lake-bottom soil . This made Puli into a main agricultural center in Central Taiwan , with the major claims to fame being red sugar cane and bamboo shoots .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
But unless some major revisions are made to this promising star of tomorrow - - so you can fold it like an umbrella and store it away when not in use - - the electric car will provide no solution for traffic jams and parking hassles . Going to work electronically : Therefore , some people are casting aside the model of thinking wherein motion necessarily involves people , vehicles and roads to look for a substitute for vehicles .  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
Candidate , candidate . . . , incompetent , incompetent . . . , fall off the horse when you try to ride . . . . " From its origins as a game in which children rode on a stick horse , the puma troupe has gone from the traditional imperial examination candidate riding a red horse following a deity around to today 's riding of a white horse being sent along with the deceased to ride the clouds . This extreme development of riding with abandon through heaven and hell is a major transformation in yi-chen .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
His chance finally came in June of that year when an injured foreign player for the Giants was put on the disabled list . This freed up a spot on the major league roster , and Lu filled it . " I did n't think I 'd play for a while after coming up , " Lu recalls , " and was caught by surprise when manager Wang Chen-chih put me in the starting lineup . "  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards . It is estimated that the main veins were all worked out within less than 20 years . All this gold was shipped back to Japan , where it became a major source of finance for the imperial army 's purchases of military equipment from abroad .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient . This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
During the early period when the Consumer 's Foundation dominated the landscape , all the major newspapers had a reporter specially assigned to the " Consumer 's Foundation beat " to capture their latest move at any time . Undoubtedly , this was the principal buttress to the Consumer 's Foundations ' widespread fame . After a number of restrictions on periodicals were lifted , the thickness of news publications expanded rapidly .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
NGOs to date have no effective channels to participate in the countless detailed activities of public administration that are underway on a daily basis . Nevertheless , NGO personnel may indeed be recruited by specialized consultative committees to help formulate policy for major issues .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
Volunteer organizations , on the other hand , took aim at people 's desire to " do some good " and arranged even more volunteer activities for them . Meanwhile , the continuing education departments of many universities scheduled additional weekend classes . Figures involved in athletics were also excited , seeing the two extra Saturdays a month as an opportunity to finally begin building the sort of " athletic pyramid " that all the major sporting nations have .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
Just as there are major gaps in outsiders ' understanding of aboriginal culture in general , more detailed research needs to be carried out about the mathematical conceptions of aborigines . This research should be broken down according to age , tribe , area , social situation , and so forth . It 's wrong to make a sweeping generalization and say that " aborigines ' poor performance in math is or is not related to culture , " argues Wang Wei-chang , a photographer who often visits aboriginal communities .  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
Master Hongyi is the fourth major work that Siong Leng has put on since 1993 . The story line departs significantly from the typical love stories featured in most nanguan works , and Siong Leng also breaks significant new musical ground by moving beyond the standard four instruments ( pipa , dongxiao , sanxian , and erxian ) to include an entire Chinese orchestra . The group also parts from tradition by incorporating folk dances into the play .  
This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term . Their writing reflected the grandiose Zeitgeist of the Han Empire , and became the major form of Han literature .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .

The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
The year before last , the United Nations nominated over 20 ecologically important areas worldwide as biosphere reserves , to be the subject of major conservation efforts with the support of the international community . But although East Asia was recognized as one of the regions of greatest biodiversity , a lack of detailed species lists and ecological background data prevented many areas being listed .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
" A design based on the cooling techniques used in jet engines would definitely be much more effective than the typical electric fans now in use , and would be less costly to manufacture , " explains Lai . Currently a major computer manufacturer in Taiwan has acquired the design patent to this kind of technology , which will be applied to the production of as many as 200,000 notebook computers a year .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization . The G8 summit held this past July in Genoa , Italy was besieged by over 100,000 protesters .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River .

Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people .

In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .

They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
The book indicates the positions of " reflex zones " on the feet that correspond to the organs of the urinary , digestive , circulatory and immune systems , and states that the nerve endings in these reflex zones are linked to the major organs of the body . People 's feet spend months and years closed up in " shoe hell , " so that the blood circulation is restricted , and this can easily lead to poor health .  
Choreographers often take their inspiration for flamenco dances from the popular opera " Carmen , " which tells the tale of a gypsy girl . Oddly enough , flamenco is just the opposite of Western classical music in that the dark and moody music ( such as soleares ) is in a major key , while bulerias and other music in minor keys is up tempo .  
The final major focus is miniature fuel cells . We expect that by 2006 we can develop mobile phone batteries that will run for 50 days on standby , and notebook computer batteries that will run for 12 hours . When you go and sit in a cafe to write an urgent report and go online to find information via a wireless Internet connection , you wo n't have to worry about your computer running out of power .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Yeh Kuang-hui , an assistant research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , has researched traditional Chinese conceptions of filial piety . He points out that the result of such social precepts as " parents can do no wrong " and " there are three major offenses against filial piety , and the gravest of all is not producing an heir " is an autocratic family . It offers a kind of " absolute " or compulsory filial piety that no longer holds water .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong . With the epidemic continuing to spread , and major medical centers themselves being taken out of action by the illness , how can we get back on a stable footing as quickly as possible ?  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
The three major gods have thousands of incarnations . For instance Vishnu can appear as fish , wild boar , dwarf , holy turtle and so forth , and Vishnu 's wife-Durga the " inaccessible " - alike has multiple forms and godly powers : Devi , Parvati , Uma , and Kali are among her beautiful incarnations .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .

In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .

Located in a low-lying area , when a nearby river burst its banks the school was filled with all manner of dirt and river sludge and with no money for repairs was effectively abandoned for several years .  
Because the old building often flooded when it rained , children often found themselves searching for their floating flip flops when they got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night . When there was a sudden rainstorm , many found it hard to sleep at all .

The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches .

Liquid wastes from urban and industrial pollution sources represent about 20 to 40 per cent of total liquid waste generation , but are the major sources of organic pollutants , heavy metals and hazardous toxic chemicals .  
Cutting down trees for firewood is also a major cause of deforestation in tropical dry forests and nonforest wooded areas located near dense human settlements in Africa and south Asia .  
Several major cities remained under siege , encircled or under sustained military pressure by one or the other side , resulting in increased hardship for the civilian population and compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation .  
Cognizant of urban transition as an irreversible demographic , economic and societal process which can be a major instrument for securing balanced economic and spatial development and relieve the severe pressure on scarce agricultural land ,  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
The future of coal as a major fuel is problematic , mainly because of environmental concerns at the local , regional and global levels over its contribution to local pollution , acid rain and climate change .  
The Programme of Action , the major outcome , is based on an explicit recognition of the peculiar characteristics of Small Island Developing States , notably their fragility and extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and international economic shocks .

Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
A specific aspect of this development especially worried the international community : the major troubled debtors were large , middleincome economies that owed the bulk of their debts to the top commercial banks of the key industrialized countries .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
They must also adapt to a new form of " upstream " industrial competition determined by specialized skills , quality products , clean technologies , compliance with demanding standards and major investments in research and development .  
Another major obstacle is the broad range of activities in which transnational crime is involved , which are not always covered or sanctioned by existing criminal legislation .  
The historical perspective and the social , cultural and political reality of Namibia prior to independence had played a major role in shaping its Constitution .

Hungary had supported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite extension , for we are convinced that this major international instrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of the nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly development of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes .  
The deliberate creation of regional trading blocs , the introduction of managed trade and the attempts to link human rights , environmental considerations and labour codes to trade are major threats which , if implemented , would dim the hope of a free environment for trade .  
The transfer of major financial resources to and from our markets causes great instability in capital flows in the world , leading to concern and uncertainty , and threatens the accumulated efforts of our peoples to establish a more just , more orderly and more stable economic system .  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
There is an increasing realization worldwide that in major denials of human rights , which breed antagonisms and deep resentments , there lie the seeds of international discord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and territorial ambitions .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .

If we , the United Nations united not , as 50 years ago , against someone , but driven by the desire for peaceful cooperation show sufficient determination to give effect to our own proposals at this Meeting and at major conferences such as those held under United Nations auspices in recent years , the world stands a chance of ensuring a better and safer life in the twenty-first century .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .

Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
While negotiations on conventional weapons , with a view to restricting the use of land-mines , and on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty are moving ahead satisfactorily , we can not ignore the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , a major , if flawed , disarmament instrument .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 50 / 291 and the special meeting of the First Committee as well as other events traditionally held in observance of Disarmament Week have once again proven that the international community continues to rely on Disarmament Week as an appropriate occasion for further promoting national and international activities to educate and inform the public about major disarmament issues and developments .

Most Member States indicated that a comparative trial Peace-keeping Services Agreement between the Government of Canada and the United Nations , currently being tested in Haiti , was a useful starting-point and that , with some adjustments , it could serve as the basis for the wet / dry leasing concept , whereby some minor items would be considered for reimbursement under the major items , and some would be considered for reimbursement under a minor equipment / consumable dollar reimbursement rate .  
This would include major equipment , large quantities of minor equipment or consumables at or above a threshold value , to be agreed in phase III , destroyed or damaged as a result of hostile action or abandoned at the direction of the Force Commander owing to operational exigencies ( e.g . , emergency evacuations to protect the Force ) .

This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
Given the tremendous amount of extant and potentially critical information relating to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the importance of providing strategic guidance to the investigative teams , the Prosecutor and his senior management team decided in early 1995 that a major restructuring of the Investigations Unit \ x { e5b8 } Strategy Team , including a substantial increase in staff , was warranted .  
Building on the experience of the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) and other efforts , major international scientific planning and inter-agency cooperative efforts are under way to advance a set of complementary global observing systems - the Global Climate Observing System , the Global Ocean Observing System , and the Global Terrestrial Observing System - covering the major environmental compartments .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
These included two introductory posters , published in 1990 and 1991 , and a major campaign poster in the six official languages , published in 1992 ; a press kit , three public television announcements and two documentary films on single-parent families and on the family and ageing , produced by the Department of Public Information ; a regularly updated calendar of events related to the Year ; stickers on the Year and the International Day of Families .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .  
Voluntary repatriation continues to be the preferred durable solution to the refugee problem in the region , but the recurring internal security problems in Rwanda , coupled with arbitrary arrests throughout the country , have emerged as major obstacles preventing refugees from returning .  
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .  
In a letter dated 14 December 1994 ( S / 1994 / 1418 ) from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 724 ( 1991 ) concerning Yugoslavia , the Council was informed of a major resurgence of diphtheria in several countries in central Asia and eastern Europe , and of the fact that the only available stocks of anti-serum to combat that serious condition were located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) .  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
While poverty results in certain kinds of environmental stress , the major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production , particularly in industrialized countries , which is a matter of grave concern , aggravating poverty and imbalances .  Rising sealevels as a result of global warming cause a grave and immediate threat to people living in island countries and coastal areas .  
It is inexplicable and hypocritical that the NATO aggression should come at a time when negotiations are in progress and when major steps are made along the road to the ultimate peaceful resolution , in the name of peace and the United Nations , which have been created with a goal of assisting and protecting the peoples who are endangered and not to give in to the militants implicated even in the war crimes .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
At its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council decided on the modalities of a comprehensive and coordinated follow-up to major international conferences in the economic , social and related fields .  
Whatever the specific arrangements for the Assembly 's review , it is essential to ensure that its outcome contributes to maintaining the political momentum and visibility of the sustainable development agenda as well as to the broader discussion currently under way of the reform of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields and to discussions on the agenda for development and the coordinated follow-up of other major United Nations conferences .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .  
He pointed to the successful collaboration of JUNIC in the field of major United Nations conferences and to the benefits of strong inter-agency cooperation ; he expressed his belief that increased effectiveness would result from a further streamlining of the JUNIC agenda and encouraged its members to use the annual meetings for focusing on a limited number of important information policy issues .  
Their impact is based on the role entrepreneurship plays in long-term economic growth , on the special role small - and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector ( where women 's businesses are concentrated ) play in economic development , and on the major social benefits associated with the greater economic autonomy and access to markets and decision-making that are inevitably linked to women 's access to and ability to command resources .

Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
Most recently , on the heels of the Mexican payments crisis and the contagion factor described above ( see paras . 40-43 ) , the Governments of the major creditor countries have sought to bolster international confidence in developing economies through a strengthened early-warning system based on enhanced surveillance of economic policies .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .  
However , the coexistence of different groups is not always peaceful , and problems relating to minorities are today one of the major sources of international and internal conflicts involving widespread and at times massive human rights violations with severe repercussions for the peace and stability of the community of nations .  
NULLThe educational and training series entitled Explorations in Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) Technology consists of a set of workbooks designed for self-exploration of analytical techniques and major application areas in information systems technology for environmental managers .  Over 3,500 copies have been distributed since 1991 .  
NULLStates reported adopting the recommendations on strengthening the efforts of the international community against money-laundering , adopted by the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) established by the Heads of State or Government of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and the President of the Commission of European Communities at the fifteenth annual economic summit , held in Paris in July 1989 .  
NULLThe practices described in previous reports of arbitrarily rounding up children from the streets of the capital and major towns in northern Sudan and detaining them in special camps usually situated in remote areas continued to take place during the period under examination ( see E / CN . 4 / 1994 / 48 , paras . 89-94 , and E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 58 , paras .

As the Commissioner-General has pointed out , the parties to this process and the major donors to the Agency have asked UNRWA not only to maintain its existing services throughout its area of operations during the interim period , but to play a larger role in helping to effect improvements in the social and economic spheres in which the Agency has acquired a special expertise .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
The Council considered the theme of coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and the implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , during the coordination segment of its substantive session of 1995 .  
The Commission for Social Development would play a central role , in particular from the perspective of social integration ; the Secretariat would report to the Council on the activities and findings of other relevant functional commissions ; in deciding , the year before , on the contents of its review the Council would take into account the related choice of theme ( s ) for the integrated consideration of the follow-up of major conferences .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .

Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
Expressing its concern that , despite the determined efforts undertaken by developing countries in terms of implementing continuous economic reforms and structural adjustments , the burden of debt and debt service of these countries continues to be a major obstacle to their sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
On the contrary , at that meeting the participants had unanimously adopted the Brisbane Declaration , which called upon France , amongst other things , to conduct a prior assessment of any major project such as nuclear testing on the marine environment , and to make its data and studies available to the international community for independent and comprehensive assessment .  
The Croatian aggression resulted in major and forcible demographic displacement in the areas under the protection of the United Nations forces , i.e . , in mass resettlement and exodus of the Serbian population , violation of human rights , burning and destruction of their property including the Orthodox places of worship and Serbian cultural and historical monuments .  
It is clear that continuous Croatian threats , sabre rattling and persistent military provocations , as well as the deployment of great number of Croatian troops in the contiguous territories of Srem and Baranja , are not a way to overcome major outstanding problems in a satisfactory manner , i.e . , by peaceful means and through political negotiations .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The net decreases in resources for the economic and social areas which had been noted by some representatives represented significant one-time expenditures approved in 1994-1995 for the major global conferences that had taken place during the current biennium .  
The impact , observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths , produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet ; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth . 
Further requests the Secretary-General to elaborate his proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly and summit-level meetings of a representative character , on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
In the light of this and against the backdrop of the current climate of budgetary stringency and scarcity of official development assistance , two major policy issues have been identified : ( a ) how to improve aid allocations to the least developed countries ; and ( b ) how to enhance the quality and effectiveness of assistance .  
Since emissions of pollutants into the environment , including toxic and hazardous wastes , originated primarily in the developed countries , and since the latter 's unsustainable consumption and production patterns continued to be the major causes of the deterioration of the global environment , developed countries should take the main responsibility for protecting the environment .  
Conduct a strategic needs analysis in the area of supply of goods and services for the Organization and specifically , for field missions , including the related contracting procedures , determining distinctive characteristics of the required procurement action , in particular in support of rapid deployment of new operations and major expansion of existing ones ; ( b ) Undertake a systematic in-depth review of :  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
While the Working Group is convinced that a strengthening of international cooperation and solidarity is essential for universal realization of the right to development , it is aware than there are major weaknesses in the ability of the United Nations system to make this cooperation effective and sufficiently strong to solve the acute problems currently facing the international community .  
In post-emergency situations , a group which often became a major liability and risk to the precarious peace process was that of soldiers who had to be demobilized and prepared for reintegration into civil society ; that task posed formidable challenges to be addressed jointly with the United Nations system and other concerned parties . 
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;

Mr . TRAORE ( Guinea ) said that the five major conferences organized by the United Nations in recent years on questions relating to social development and the conference on human settlements to be held in Istanbul bore witness to the renewed interest and intensive mobilization of the international community in connection with those issues .  
Besides its harmful effects on the individual , drug abuse represented a major handicap to economic and social development , lowering productivity and imposing a heavy burden on health-care facilities and social service agencies .  
erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Further requests the Secretary-General to elaborate his proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly and summit-level meetings of a representative character , on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , [ 3 ] / the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development , and on restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ;  
Although resident coordinators had a key role to play , they should be assisted by ensuring that the local representatives of other entities engaged in operational activities consulted them regarding the implementation of major programmes and by authorizing the resident coordinators to propose to the heads of those entities the amendment of country programmes and major projects , where required , to bring them into line with the country strategy note , in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 .

were only two solutions : one would be for the current system to be radically changed so as to incorporate the specialized agencies as major players in determining conditions of service for the staff ; the other would be to allow the staff of the specialized agencies and technical programmes to develop their own system so that they could get on with the important tasks that needed to be addressed urgently .  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,

Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
was noted that Administration was reactive rather than proactive , seldom utilized essential management practices , such as benchmarks for major administrative services providing clear indications of the time for processing administrative actions , and lacked written instructions or manuals on internal administrative procedure .  
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Supreme Council expressed its deep appreciation and gratitude to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman and to the Government and people of the Sultanate of Oman for the gracious hospitality and sincere sentiments of brotherhood with which the leaders of the Cooperation Council were received and commended the distinguished arrangements and important role played by His Majesty as President of the current session of the Supreme Council and his excellent conduct of the meetings , which had a major impact on arrival at the important and fruitful conclusions achieved at this session .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
In this context , the major tool utilized by public administration in its work should not be decisions taken on an individual basis , but regulations intended to create mechanisms and frameworks within which independent activity can take place and social and economic entities can produce initiatives .  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , 6 / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the United Nations Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook , and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions where they occur ;  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In order to effect such an integrated scheme of cooperation along the lines I have just outlined , my delegation believes that the institution of inter-agency task forces , as established by the Administrative Committee on Coordination , can be a major channel through which participating agencies can engage in constructive dialogue for the purpose of ensuring close cooperation in effectively implementing the Programme of Action . Intensified efforts for coordination and cooperation are very much desired .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
In paragraph 42 of the report of the Secretary - General , we read that the Commission has already established an Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Nevertheless , we are aware that there have been shortfalls that are concealed by misleading national averages , as a result of the difficulties and contrasts of major social disparities and the children who are victims of exploitation , of physical and emotional violence , and of abandonment and injustice .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
New and necessary foundations have been laid between two of the world 's major collegiate bodies , which have the privilege to have among their ranks enlightened spokespersons from all over the world , which constantly seek the same ideal of harmony and coexistence on the vast and glorious stage formed by all the continents , and which raise their voices in this Hall for the supreme ideal of peace .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guarani , the predominant aboriginal language .  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
In conclusion , the Commission may wish to note that , historically , major socio-economic changes ( comparable to the scale of change required to restructure production and consumption in industrialized countries ) have occurred as a response to perceived opportunities ( for example , widespread availability of affordable cars ) not to government prescription .  
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : ( a ) the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process , including national reconciliation efforts ; ( b ) the breakdown of mutual support systems ; ( c ) the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; ( d ) the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; ( e ) the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
Conduct a strategic needs analysis in the area of supply of goods and services for the Organization and specifically , for field missions , including the related contracting procedures , determining distinctive characteristics of the required procurement action , in particular in support of rapid deployment of new operations and major expansion of existing ones ; ( b ) Undertake a systematic in-depth review of :  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
Thus , according to information received from the Secretariat , the compensation to troop-contributing countries for expenses incurred for inland transportation of major equipment beyond the first 800 kilometres along the consignment route from the home location of the equipment to the point of embarkation would be a one-time payment of an amount equal to 0.25 per cent of the monthly wet lease rates for major equipment for each additional complete 800 kilometres .  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
2 During the reporting period , the international community paid increased attention to the illicit traffic in , and abuse of , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , acknowledged to be a major threat to the fabric of society and the security of States .  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency . 
In cooperation with specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations , the Mission will take part in the clearance and verification of heavily mined areas throughout the territory , particularly the main supply routes between the major regional areas and Luanda , which are considered paramount in the deployment of UNAVEM III and the free circulation of goods and persons .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
An individual in Iraq ( the Director-General of a major missile establishment ) alleged to be responsible for this acquisition , stated that he had destroyed , in August 1995 , all guidance and control components received and had informed Iraq 's governmental authorities on two occasions , in August and October 1995 , about the receipt of these proscribed items .  
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues , and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
Four main developments are addressed here : ( a ) the programmatic reports of the Secretary-General on an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda for Development ; ( b ) the cycle of international conferences on pressing issues and their outcome before the international community ; ( c ) the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and related activities ; and ( d ) the Secretary-General 's initiative to launch The United Nations Blue Book Series , documenting the active role and the legacy of the United Nations in resolving major issues .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
Acting together under the auspices of ECE , member Governments have developed over the years a set of major international legal instruments in the field of transport that establish appropriate international regulations , norms and standards , facilitate border crossing and provide for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks for road , rail , inland waterways and combined transport .  
A fifth objective of the subprogramme will be to monitor international situations and trends as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the work of the Organization by major media networks , to ensure that the Secretary-General and senior officials of the Organization are kept informed of developments on the international scene in a comprehensive and timely manner .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
In order to develop the regional capabilities to foresee effectively upcoming trends and challenges , the fourth objective is to facilitate monitoring and assessing of new development processes and their projections , including summaries of major projected global trends in aspects that are relevant to the region .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 264 and Council decision 1996 / 203 , the coordination segment of the Council should also be devoted to the consideration of the implementation of the agreed conclusions on the theme of the 1995 coordination segment of the Council relating to the coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the review of publications by the Department of Public Information [ 1 ] / and urges all efforts be made to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
This report is in follow-up to agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , which were approved by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1995 ( see A / 50 / 3 , chap .  
The prime objective of the task forces is to assure that adequate support from the headquarters level is provided to the resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams in each country so that they may , in full consultation with national Governments , facilitate a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences ( para . 39 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 ) .  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
The executive secretaries of the regional economic commissions will be asked to produce a product analogous to that requested of the resident coordinator , focusing on regional aspects of the major thrusts of United Nations system activities in the regional level .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
Despite the satisfactory economic performance and the progress and acceleration of reconstruction , Israel 's continuous occupation of south Lebanon and its continued aggression against Lebanon and its citizens remain the major obstacle to comprehensive national recovery . 
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
That had made it possible to implement policies which were better adapted to local conditions in the areas of health and education , particularly in the provinces of the North and the Iles Loyaut , controlled by the FLNKS , which had succeeded in catching up to a considerable extent in the areas of infrastructure and public services , and achieving major progress in the economic sphere .  
The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin .

M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
The establishment of an international criminal court would be a monumental advance , affording , at last , genuine international jurisdictional protection to some of the world 's major legal achievements . 
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .  
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia pays special attention to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms by devoting its whole chapter 3 entitled Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms to the elaboration of different human rights standards including both civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural rights , mainly following the standards elaborated in major international human rights instruments .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  233 .  Among the key characteristics of the United Nations are its universal membership and comprehensive mandate .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
As indicated in the proclamation of the Supreme Council for the Defence of Afghanistan and duly reflected in our statement in the Security Council on 16 October 1996 , we strongly support an immediate and lasting ceasefire based upon the demilitarization of Kabul , the creation of a neutral police force in the capital and the establishment of a transitional Government of national unity encompassing all major Afghan sides .  
This affirmative vote will , however , reflect more our firm and overriding attachment to the overall process of codification and progressive development of international law , rather than a strong conviction that the text of the draft Convention now before us is a fully satisfactory and balanced one which could not have been improved in some of its major aspects .  
The Committee took note with appreciation of the efforts of ACC to promote a coordinated and integrated system-wide approach to the follow-up to major international conferences through ad hoc inter-agency task forces , and requested that the results of the comprehensive assessment of the work of the task forces to be carried out by ACC in 1997 should be included in the next annual overview report of ACC .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
Similar expectations also exist for the quality and quantity of information and contributions made by the major groups themselves : in the next phase , their inputs will need to be more accurate , unique and reliable , while their organizational structures will need to be increasingly transparent and accountable .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
For retransmission of major national and international events and to meet a variety of needs , the ONPT also has an Earth mobile station which is used for occasional remote sensing and telephony , and which can operate with international and regional satellites .  
He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
Its development , however , should not delay action , and it may not be needed in countries where major direct or indirect causes have been identified , well understood and documented , or where deforestation is not viewed as a problem at the national level .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
At the coordination segment of the Council of 1995 , devoted to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the Council decided that it would ensure the harmonization and coordination of the agendas and work programmes of the functional commissions by promoting a clearer division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them ( thirteenth paragraph of agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 ) .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
As a result of the transition to a market economy , the Russian Federation has experienced a sharp deterioration of all major economic and social indicators since 1990 , including a decrease in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of roughly 38 per cent from 1990 to 1995 .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The purpose of turning their bimonthly meetings into a political / technical seminar , with the participation of the Commission 's and Iraq 's scientific and technical experts , has been to narrow the major outstanding issues to a manageable quantity .  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
At the country level , the General Assembly acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
In paragraphs 39 and 40 of its resolution 50 / 120 , the General Assembly reiterated the resident coordinator 's level of responsibility and authority , making him / her responsible for facilitating the coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the country level , and requesting that the resident coordinator be informed of planned programme activities of the United Nations system organizations at an early stage of formulation .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The Committee took note with appreciation of the efforts of ACC to promote a coordinated and integrated system-wide approach to the follow-up to major international conferences through ad hoc inter-agency task forces , and requested that the results of the comprehensive assessment of the work of the task forces to be carried out by ACC in 1997 should be included in the next annual overview report of ACC .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
While there is not yet a universally accepted definition of terrorism _ academics and experts tending to approach the phenomenon from varying perspectives , and Governments tending to label as acts of terrorism manifestations of the phenomenon which directly affect their own interests while remaining unconcerned about the emergencies of others _ admittedly , one of the major difficulties standing in the way of consensus has been the continuing controversy about wars of national liberation and the motives advanced to justify violence .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
The high technical and professional standard of Cubas scientific work force , allied to the major achievements in the development of the chemical-pharmaceutical , biotechnological and medical equipment industries , is leading Cuba to concentrate its efforts and resources on programmes that generate export earnings , for which purpose we are working hard to find markets in which to expand our exports to the maximum .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Data from these surveys will serve a new major initiative , namely to establish a national strategy for increasing social productivity and reducing regional disparities ; this work supported by UNDP will be based on defining and mapping poverty , and on establishing a national poverty line or band . 
Recognizing also that coordinated follow _ up implies that the major conferences should be viewed as interlinked and contributing to an integrated framework of and a global partnership for development ; in this context , major cross _ cutting themes established in the world conferences need to be identified and built upon ,  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
By resolution 1997 / 61 of 25 July 1997 , at its substantive session in 1997 , the Council stressed the need to further promote integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major international conferences in the social , economic and related fields , and decided to include the question in the agenda of its substantive session on an annual basis .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The themes of the Colloquium will be : an overview of the international law-making process and the role of the International Law Commission ; major complexities encountered in contemporary international law-making ; selection of topics for codification and progressive development by the Commission and its working methods ; the Commissions work and the shaping of international law ; enhancing the Commissions relationship with other law-making bodies and relevant academic and professional institutions ; and making international law more relevant and readily available .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the areas of education , literacy and health , in particular maternal and child health , and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  
Closely related to the follow-up to and implementation of the Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation of and follow up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels to the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security . 
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
According to reports received in January 1997 , besides the practice of summoning suspected political opponents to the security headquarters every day early in the morning and releasing them late in the evening , night _ time summoning to the security headquarters became a constant feature in Khartoum and other major northern Sudanese towns during the second half of 1996 .  33 .  On 15 August 1996 , 65 civilians and active and retired officers were arrested in Port Sudan .  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
In this connection , the frequent undue delays experienced in court cases involving rape and sexual offences pose a major problem , so that at any given time 200 to 250 cases are pending before G Court , whereas a backlog of 80 cases is normally considered acceptable .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The topics discussed included the varying experiences of world regions regarding mortality , epidemiological and health transitions ; the problems faced in measuring mortality levels and mortality by cause of death , particularly in developing countries ; the various approaches to the measurement of health status and their limitations ; the health and mortality situation in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries ; and the relevance of risk factors underlying major causes of death for the formulation of health interventions .  
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
Welcoming the fact that the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for a United Nations system _ wide approach to human rights issues has been reflected in the recommendations of major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,  
The President : Members will recall that , during the consultations I held pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 181 , Member States expressed an understanding that I would select non-governmental-organization representatives of major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to participate in the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly according to certain criteria . 
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
IS3.18 Requirements of $ 33,500 , reflecting a reduction of $ 22,600 , would cover travel for promotional and representational activities with respect to establishing cooperation with national postal administrations , maintaining contact with international and national philatelic organizations , developing new sources for the distribution of United Nations postage stamps , representation at major international philatelic shows and for coordination meetings of the activities of the three offices .  
The objective of the Task Force on an Enabling Environment for Economic and Social Development is to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned in order to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development , establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment , and provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .  
IACWGE has taken steps to ensure that the outputs of the task forces , such as their final reports or the guidelines for resident representatives , fully reflect a gender perspective , including direct or indirect participation in the discussions of case studies at the country level ( see ACC / 1996 / 22 , para . 31 ) ( see also the report of ACC on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up to the major United Nations conferences and summits ( E / 1997 / ) ) . 
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
At the country level , the General Assembly , in paragraph 39 of its resolution 50 / 120 , acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  233 .  Among the key characteristics of the United Nations are its universal membership and comprehensive mandate .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
Another major component of that institutional framework was the Ministry of Women and Children 's Affairs , whose role included national policy formulation , implementation of special programmes , women 's legal and social rights , registration of voluntary organizations and dealing with international organizations .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .

That consensus had found concrete expression in the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences , the themes of which - economic growth , the environment , population , human rights , social development , the advancement of women and human settlements - now should be articulated in the agenda for development , a fundamental document which should guide development worldwide on the eve of the twenty-first century .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
Despite its political will to carry out the necessary reforms , the Cambodian Government continued to face two major obstacles : the enormous bilateral and multilateral debt , which constituted a heavy burden on the Government , and poorer access to markets and deteriorating terms of trade .  
The Committee points out that the deferral of approved projects in alterations / improvements and major maintenance , although resulting in reduced spending during the current biennium , does not necessarily generate " real " savings for the Organization ; on the contrary , the more time that is lost for the completion of such projects , the more expensive they may become .

The difficulties faced by developing countries in seeking access to trade , labour and finance flows were exacerbated by protectionist barriers raised by the advanced countries because of the unfounded fear that globalization was one of the major causes of the high unemployment rate and growing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled labour . 
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .

The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,

That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
Only 82 of the 185 States Members of the United Nations reported the full set of major macroeconomic aggregates in the last five years . 19 This is despite the fact that economic statistics , and in particular national accounts , are well-established statistical areas , with internationally agreed upon standards and methodologies and with a history of data collection .

The major objective of the subprogramme is to promote an informed and positive public understanding of the activities of the United Nations and help build broad-based global support for the Organizations goals by highlighting the priority issues of concern to the international community .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Armed conflict in southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
The Sub-Commission 's working methods in respect of its research and study projects should , consistent with the independent expert character of the body , entail a well-prepared , thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question , any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission . 
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;

In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
International cooperation in building major facilities is most effective when the project draws on the complementary capabilities of different nations , or when the project would be too expensive for individual nations to afford or if the international cooperative initiative itself represents a major challenge for human beings to achieve a particular goal .  
Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
International and regional conferences and meetings , in particular the twelfth World AIDS Conference , held in Geneva in June 1998 , provided an effective forum for drawing global attention to the major gaps in action on the epidemic and to the very significant role that young people can play in shaping the global response .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
The analysis conducted by the General Assembly for the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in 1998 confirmed that resident coordinators have an important role to play in assisting Governments in their responsibilities for the integrated implementation of the major international conferences .  
Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
The Economic and Social Council , pursuant to decision 1998 / 290 of 31 July 1998 , taken at its substantive session of 1998 , held a two-day informal meeting on basic indicators for the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major United Nations conferences .  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
The major policy recommendations in the area of social development include enhanced budgetary allocations for social services , establishment of a formal social fund , targeting of measures related to employment creation , cash transfers , free or subsidized provision of essential goods and services and credit facilities in the short term , introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance , and revision of development strategies to minimize vulnerability to crises in the future .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Serving as the departmental focal point for developing and coordinating the implementation of global public information strategies and activities to promote special conferences , United Nations decades , international years and other major events relating to the major thematic areas ;  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .  Over 45 NGOs , along with major bilateral donors , have committed personnel and resources to meet the immediate relief needs of the people of Kosovo .  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
The view was expressed that African countries in particular had been marginalized in that field , which was an unfortunate situation , considering that the continent was faced with major social and economic problems , some of which could be solved by the application of space technology . 
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
In the post _ cold _ war world which emerged at the beginning of the present decade , the initial phase of optimism , cooperation and the adoption of major decisions in the field of world strategic policy has gradually been replaced by another in which narrow individual and often intransigent considerations on the part of the various international actors tend to prevail .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
In 1998 , intensive training was conducted for over 60 local counterpart teams in the operation and maintenance of existing water systems in the southern sector , and 45 major feeding centres and main distribution points received adequate supplies of clean water . 
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
The Seminar offered presentations by representatives of the academic and non-governmental communities and the private sector on international policy issues and trends and on selected project experience from Africa and Latin America , which included activities supported by the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability . 41 .  A major cross-cutting theme considered at the Seminar was gender-sensitive and disability-responsive policy design and evaluation .  
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
On the other hand , commitments undertaken under IMF / World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes have reinforced and widened WTO commitments and accelerated the adoption of non-reciprocal autonomous liberalization measures , and bilateral agreements with major developed countries have further reduced the remaining policy options and WTO flexibility . 
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Without an increase in development assistance funding , it would be impossible to meet all the current major challenges ranging from international debt , education and health to access to knowledge for the promotion of economic and social development .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,

Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,

Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
A practical programme of supply management to reduce excess supply , and to bring a better medium-term balance into the market , would need to be based on detailed assessments of trends in world demand for , and supply of , each of the major commodities experiencing persistently of depressed prices , the related trends in world stocks , and the expected future price trends , so as to determine the need for supply management in particular cases .  
Its governing General Council allows representatives of all major countries ( with the notable exception of China and Russia ) to participate in relative equality ( at least formally ) , and the WTO ministerial conferences have been accompanied by extensive public debate .  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;

Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
The European Union attached great importance to the commitments made by all countries and major groups to the implementation of the principles of the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 ; it believed that the enhancement of public awareness was essential and engaged in continuous dialogue with civil society on environmental matters .  
Given that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with fortuitous events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of oil producers and consumers alike .  
Conscious that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with unanticipated events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of producers and consumers alike .

Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries and , in this regard , stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries , and in this regard stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Each of the two competing and opposing systemic families was faced with a specific , endogenous and major adaptation crisis , with both crises interacting at the international level .

Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
Armed conflict in the southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
One priority of the humanitarian pillar of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo , which is headed by my Special Envoy , is to help these people through the winter we are working hard , together with major governmental partners such as the United States of America , the European Union and Japan and many non-governmental organizations , to meet this deadline.But more intractable problems remain unresolved . 
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
This aspect of the struggle to eradicate the scourge of anti-personnel mines deserves our attention for two major reasons : technological progress , which is the indispensable key to decisive progress in the field regarding weapons disseminated in huge numbers over vast areas , in 60 countries ; and promising scientific progress which we see today here and there .  
My delegation intends to play an active role in the preparations for the informal process , seeking to ensure broad input from all relevant actors , including regional organizations , various parts of the United Nations and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 , including civil society .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
Mr . Gatilov ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : Today ' s discussion is taking place against the backdrop of the major political outcomes of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) Istanbul summit , which laid down the basic guidelines for the formation of a stable architecture for security and cooperation on the European continent in the twenty-first century on the basis of the United Nations Charter and generally recognized principles of international law . 
As a logical consequence of the chronically unstable situation in certain parts of the continent and the constantly growing number of refugees generated by its convulsive conflicts , dealing with the humanitarian situation in Africa today is a major challenge to Africans and to the whole international community .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
I am happy to point out that I have been encouraged by the open and frank views that I encountered and by the expressed willingness to contribute constructively in the continuing search for workable solutions to overcome the major sticking points on the basis of constructive negotiations , flexibility and compromise .  
Even though we continue to be collectively and individually committed to finding a comprehensive solution that would make the Security Council more representative , effective and transparent , delegations are also getting exhausted and drained by the repetitiveness of the debate , as we run around in circles trying to square major differences .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Cairo + 5 is part of a series of international conferences that constitute fundamental elements for the advancement and improvement of the situation of mankind , and particularly that of women , who in many instances suffer major discrimination based on their gender and on historic , social and cultural beliefs that undermine their possibilities to advance and their basic right to occupy their due place in all aspects of social life on an equal footing with men .  
Despite the economic growth that began under the influence of the structural adjustment programmes combined with the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 , the problems of survival experienced by poor and vulnerable households were aggravated and the harmful effects of the crisis have been very much felt in some social sectors education , employment and health and have to an extent compromised the major gains made in previous decades .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
The Commission emphasizes the fundamental fact that oceans and seas constitute the major part of the planet that supports life , drive the climate and hydrological cycle , and provide the vital resources to be used to ensure well-being for present and future generations and economic prosperity , to eradicate poverty , to ensure food security and to conserve marine biological diversity and its intrinsic value for maintaining the conditions that support life on earth . 
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
Among the cleaner transportation fuels , within a near-term horizon , natural gas appears to be the most likely and cost-effective significant alternative to motor gasoline and diesel , particularly for use in fleets , given its abundant resources , its possibilities as a high performance fuel , its clean burning qualities and its convenient commercial availability to end users , especially in the major transportation consumer nations .  
The Committee is concerned that the State party did not take into account the Committees 1993 major concerns and recommendations when it adopted policies at federal , provincial and territorial levels which exacerbated poverty and homelessness among vulnerable groups during a time of strong economic growth and increasing affluence .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
The combination of a major development issue , such as biotechnology , with a focus approach on a specific aspect such as food production , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complementary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
The apparent economic and technical obsolescence of a major part of the fleet is necessarily reflected in higher operating costs , as repair and maintenance rapidly increase with age , schedule delays and unreliability , and greater environmental risks associated with obsolete vessels .  
The Commission had also studied suitable methods for selecting the project company , bearing in mind that the length of the negotiations between the public authorities of the host country and potential investors often constituted a major practical obstacle to the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
One important step would be the introduction of a comprehensive national legislation that removed major stumbling blocks and put into effect an efficient and effective policy for the applications of space technology in the development of the social and economic sectors .  
A subsequent project identified the major causes for erosion and the high sedimentation of the Rewa River , and elaborated a detailed programme combining legal aspects , flood control , river regulation and appropriate land management practices for sustainable development of agricultural lands .  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
Since independence , the Croatian education system has undergone a major transformation ; national curricula and syllabuses now reflect new principles of economic , social and political development , thereby enabling pupils to gain access to the skills and responsibilities required in a democratic society .  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
CHEC has played an active participatory role in most of the major United Nations global conferences since the early 1970 s , with human ecology introducing Commonwealth professionals , international and national NGOs and Governments to the connections between social , economic and ecological systems and human development .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
Specialized institutions devoted to specific sectors should be established and provided with adequate staff and budgetary resources for their operations ; such institutions are required particularly to deal with major resource conservation issues , such as those involving fisheries , coastal zones and biodiversity ;  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
The observer for the Saami Council stated that the draft declaration guaranteed the basic rights and fundamental political and legal rights of indigenous peoples and that it constituted a major breakthrough principally because it underlined the principle of equality for indigenous peoples ; this had usually been denied on the grounds of discrimination . 
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The key to this success was the fact that ( 1 ) the Summit was organized around a number of very concrete developmental problems which affected major aspects of the development process and ( 2 ) a common interest between UNCTAD and non-governmental actors had been clearly identified in advance .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
The major concerns of the Russian Federation ( 97 , 99 ) are the recently established state marine boundaries ( changing geopolitical situation ) , a worsening economic situation , increasing international competition for property rights on ocean zones and resources , and absence of a mechanism for interregional and intersectoral coordination in oceanic projects .  
The major interests at the international level are the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources and pollution by dumping of waste , protection of the sensitive environment of the Arctic Ocean , and exchange of scientific information on the oceans and its living resources .

In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .

After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .

During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .

In theoretical study , they emphasized the need to grasp the basic content and essence of the " three represents . "  They paid special attention to finding where they lagged behind in practicing the " three represents " and improving rules and regulations based on the " three represents " in their efforts to improve work .  In this way , the study and implementation of the " three represents " has become a major part of the teaching by positive example in the " three stresses " education .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .

Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The rich ideological content of those songs realizes the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's major instructions on enhancing the Army 's ideological and political education , warmly eulogizes the nature and purposes of the people 's army and the glorious chapters of unity and struggle under the Party leadership , and displays the spiritual outlook of the vigorous and high-fighting spirit contemporary military personnel .  Songs are varied in style .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .

China is a country with dense population and little cultivated land .  For a considerably long period of time , it will be difficult to change the basic trend in which population is increasing , and cultivated land is decreasing .  We must regard the protection of cultivated land as one of the major affairs affecting the national economy and the people 's livelihood as well as the country 's sustainable development , and must never slacken efforts in grasping it at any time .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .

Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .

In the light of glorious achievements attained in military logistical building and reform in the past decade , leaders from the logistics departments of major military units and the Armed Police Corps as well as experts and scholars from some universities and institutes had an in-depth discussion .  Their discussion focused on the epochal background for Chairman Jiang to give major expositions on logistical work , and characteristics and guiding position of his theory .  
Evolving around the main theme of " strong support " , the meeting put forward concrete measures for carrying out Chairman Jiang 's expositions on logistical work in terms of fundamental targets , key links , and major methods , making suggestions for military logistical building and reform .  
In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .

The broad policies and specific principles for reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty have been clearly laid down by the central authorities and all major policy measures have been promulgated .  The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
During the three major political struggles last year in particular , the educational leadership role of the news media was given full play , and waves of resistance to foreign aggression , protection of sovereignty , opposition of splittism , and strengthening of China were set off .

He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
A naval guided missile escort boat formation conducted offensive and defensive battles for five days and nights amid misty rains and heavy waves in certain waters in the East China Sea in mid July .

The professors revealed that Harbin Institute of Engineering has all along played a major role in our country 's deep-dive lifesaving research .  Our country 's deep-dive lifeboats are now equipped with a dynamic orientation system developed by the institute .  At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
First , inflation was successfully restrained , and " soft landing " of the economy was smoothly implemented ; then , the tendency of deflation was effectively checked , and a major turning point was brought about in economic growth .

With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .

The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
Party organizations , governments , and departments in charge at all levels are required to inspect their work on a regular basis , including major incidents , emergencies , heavy economic losses , persons and affairs which have aroused strong resentment among the masses , as well as problems with relation to the families of leading cadres .  Based on the results of supervision and inspection , any party-member leading cadres found to be involved should be dealt with according to relevant responsibility affixation stipulations ;  
seriously put into practice all the major strategic policy-decisions of the party Central Committee ; given wide publicity to the main melody of our time in line with the work arrangements made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government and in the light of Sichuan 's realistic conditions ; and have done a great deal of work and achieved sound work results in boosting both the economic development growth and an all-round social progress in our province .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
It is a pressing and important task with high requirements to conduct admonitory education with the serious cases of Cheng Kejie and Hu Changqing . Party committees at all levels must take admonitory education as a major political task , and fulfill this task by doing intensive and effective work with a strong sense of political responsibility , sufficient energy for exercising leadership , and a soaring morale and healthy mentality , thus guaranteeing that admonitory education achieve expected solid results .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .

According to analysis , the Code Red II virus is a vicious virus which produces disastrous consequences .  This type of virus spreads fast .  It can block communications on networks and paralyze servers .  It contains a remote control hacker program .  The virus is mainly a threat to local area networks , business networks , and Internet users with Windows 2000 or NT operating systems .

It was revealed that the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . discovered that its major shareholders and the parties concerned had misappropriated a huge amount of funds , equivalent to 96 percent of its listed net assets , even more than what some major shareholders had misappropriated from " ST Monkey King " during a period of many years .  In this astonishing case , it can be said , the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . has set a vicious example for major shareholders and the parties concerned to misappropriate funds from a listed company .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year . "  
What is worse , in so doing , major shareholders have seriously violated the principle of " being open , fair , and impartial , " namely , a principle governing the stock market , and have directly encroached upon small and medium-sized investors ' legitimate rights and interests as well .  
Now that the CSCC has decided to place on file for investigation and prosecution both the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . and the people involved in its irregularities , circulating a notice criticizing the relevant law-violation and rule-violation behaviors , this has signaled a major move made by China 's securities control authorities aimed at restructuring listed companies in terms of management , and has demonstrated China 's securities control authorities ' firm resolve in ruthlessly cracking down on irregularities in the stock market as well .

Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .

Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
Over the past year , CPC disciplinary-enforcement and law-enforcement organs at all levels exposed , investigated , and took actions against a number of major cases characterized by high-ranking officials , huge amounts of money , large numbers of people involved , hidden methods of crime , complicated situations , and rather vicious effects on public perceptions ;  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .

On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
To the common people of China , perhaps the reform of the budget planning method has no specific links to their everyday life , but in reality , this reform , which stems from the practical demand of intensifying economic and budgetary supervision , can bring major benefits to the broad masses of the people .  That is , systems-wise , the government 's actions will be standardized , and the fulcrum of forces needed to build a clean government and oppose corruption will be strengthened .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
Zhou Tianyong also believed that while China has attained tremendous achievements in its economic development in recent years , a number of deep-seated contradictions have gradually manifested themselves .  Nevertheless , thanks to its timely major readjustments in many fields , China has been able to meet the various indexes set for its national economic reform , development , and stability under an extremely complicated situation both inside and outside the country .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
ensured the development of two major industries , such as agriculture and animal husbandry and the telecommunications industry ; downsized such industries as retail marketing , international trade , real estate , petrochemical , auto , and motor vehicle manufacturing industries ; and supported the development of major industries by selling stock rights and recovering parts of the investment .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .

He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .

The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
On 12 February , Renmin Ribao carried a commentator 's article entitled " All Members of Society Should Concern Themselves With and Give Support to Education Undertakings . " The article discussed the situation from the strategic high plane of national destiny and reinvigoration .  It said that correctly guiding young students and helping them grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
Over the past year , CPC disciplinary-enforcement and law-enforcement organs at all levels exposed , investigated , and took actions against a number of major cases characterized by high-ranking officials , huge amounts of money , large numbers of people involved , hidden methods of crime , complicated situations , and rather vicious effects on public perceptions ;  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
To the common people of China , perhaps the reform of the budget planning method has no specific links to their everyday life , but in reality , this reform , which stems from the practical demand of intensifying economic and budgetary supervision , can bring major benefits to the broad masses of the people .  That is , systems-wise , the government 's actions will be standardized , and the fulcrum of forces needed to build a clean government and oppose corruption will be strengthened .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
While giving less attention to economic growth target , the government will give macroeconomic guidance to the major problems in economic development from an even higher level .  For instance , in vigorous promoting economic restructuring , the government will give consideration to the changes at the present stage of the domestic economic development and to the increasingly sharpened international competition .  Meanwhile , the government will not only manage to resolve immediate problems but also lay eyes on long-term development .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
Zhou Tianyong also believed that while China has attained tremendous achievements in its economic development in recent years , a number of deep-seated contradictions have gradually manifested themselves .  Nevertheless , thanks to its timely major readjustments in many fields , China has been able to meet the various indexes set for its national economic reform , development , and stability under an extremely complicated situation both inside and outside the country .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
ensured the development of two major industries , such as agriculture and animal husbandry and the telecommunications industry ; downsized such industries as retail marketing , international trade , real estate , petrochemical , auto , and motor vehicle manufacturing industries ; and supported the development of major industries by selling stock rights and recovering parts of the investment .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .  
In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
These lifetime revolutionary companions who were born in the same month of the same year were well-experienced and loyal communist soldiers and outstanding proletariat revolutionaries ; they made major indelible contributions to China 's revolution and developmental undertakings .  
However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
Following investigation , the discipline inspection and supervision departments of Chongqing Municipality maintained that former Fendu Country Secretary Gao Rongmiao , being the principal person responsible for improving the party 's work style and ensuring honest government administration , was negligent of management and supervision and that he is held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  
Li Renfu , former head of Fendu County and incumbent deputy county secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in Huang Faxiang 's case that occurred in his term of office .  Besides , he also violated regulations in accepting " awards " and cash gifts .  He was dismissed from the posts as deputy secretary , member of the standing committee , and member , of the county party committee .  
Huang Faxiang 's wife Chen Zhiqiong , former Fengdu County deputy secretary , was held for major leading responsibility in issuing awards at random by the Fengdu County Financial Bureau and Local Taxation Bureau . She also violated regulations in accepting enormous amounts of " awards " and cash gifts , and in illegally allowing her husband to use 15,000 yuan of public funds .  She was expelled from the party .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
2 .  It has vigorously developed multiple forms of commercial personal insurance as a major supplement for social security , which has played an important role in raising the social security level , and instituting and perfecting a social security system in China .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
Sensing the seriousness of the matter after repeatedly receiving information about the terrorist attacks , the Security Bureau immediately called meetings with the Police Department . A special task force formed by ten departments was assigned to handle the matter .  The Immigration Department was instructed to keep a close watch on Arabs entering the territory and to pass on to the Security Bureau all materials regarding the suspects .  So far no major suspects have been discovered , but the alert has not been called off .  
carry forward the spirit of advocating science , undertaking audacious explorations , making bold innovations , and being brave in scaling the heights of science ; actively participate in policy-making consultations on major issues concerning economic and social development ; and devote themselves in all earnestness to the great undertaking of modernization so as to make greater contributions to China 's move toward a powerful country through science and technology , to the realization of rapid economic growth , and to the great revitalization of the Chinese nation .  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that flood and drought have always been the serious hidden problems affecting China 's economic and social development and the people 's livelihood , and the impact of drought on agricultural production is particularly prominent .  All localities must firmly embrace the idea of fighting a major drought for a long time .  
To this end we need to make unremitting exploration and constantly sum up experience .  As far as legislation is concerned , we will continue to uphold the principle of proceeding from China 's national conditions , safeguard consistency in the legal system based on the constitution , persist in the integration of legislation with major decisions concerning reform and development , ensure by the means of system and legislation the implementation of the state 's major political line , expedite socialist modernization , thus ensure the country 's prosperity and perpetual political stability .  
Engineering or other projects for the development of the west which are listed as key national projects , and especially major infrastructure construction projects , environmental protection projects , projects for processing local superior natural resources or local specialty products , advanced science and technology projects , S &amp; T and educational development projects , and other projects requiring the import of foreign equipment will receive priority in inspections and priority in examinations for quarantine , in order to assure support to construction .  
Responsible person : Since the 14th Party Congress , propaganda work in newspapers and periodicals has achieved very good results in holding the banner aloft , maintaining unanimity , serving the overall situation , focusing on the central tasks , promoting reform and development , preserving social stability , singing the theme in a series of major propaganda tasks , fighting a successful battle of initiative , providing correct guidance , and performing in a lively and vigorous way ; it has thus created a very good public opinion atmosphere for reform , opening up , and modernization .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .  
If the four major changes can be realized , China will see enormous changes .  It will become a country that has accomplished modernization on the whole , and the ideal of building a powerful country and bringing prosperity to the people pursued by the kind and upright men will be preliminarily achieved as well .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
In the letter Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the north side and the south side are major parties concerned in the peninsula affairs , that China actively supports the consistent position of the northern side 's and southern side 's realizing independence and peaceful unification through dialogue and consultations , that China will , as always , continue to make positive efforts to help maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula .  
The meeting pointed out that improving environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam area is of great practical and historic significance for implementing the central strategy on major development of west China , ensuring the normal operation of the pivotal three gorges project , promoting sustainable development in the dam area , and creating a good image of the project .  
Implementing the great development of the west and speeding up the development of central and west China will open new and broader scope for China 's economic development in the 21st century ; it is a major strategic measure for maintaining China 's sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development and is of great significance for the country 's prosperity and long-lasting stability .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Viewed from another angle , if you do n't want to appraise in a most constructive , diversified and flexible way the reality that a political party and its leaders voluntarily proposed the policy of allowing a country to have two social and political systems and even two armies with their own commanders and that this policy won popular support , at least , you should believe that this country and its people have sufficient wisdom and ability to handle major issues of the state .  
At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .  The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .  
For quite a long time to come , it will still be difficult to change the basic trends of an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  It is imperative to protect farmland , regarding it as a major issue that has a bearing on the national economy and the people 's livelihood and on sustainable development .  At no time should we relax work in this respect .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The party and the government attach great importance to economic development and social progress in areas inhabited by ethnic minority , and attach great importance to training and fostering a contingent of ethnic minority cadres with both moral integrity and ability , taking this as a major measure for safeguarding the unity of the motherland , realizing national regeneration and the common prosperity of all ethnical groups .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
We should focus on the understanding of the important status and role played by the ideological and political work in the overall interests of the party and the state .  We should clearly understand the new situation and new issue faced by the ideological and political work .  We also should understand basic Marxist viewpoint and scientific method for correctly revolving these major theoretical and practical issues .  
We must strengthen our investigations and studies of the trend of social thinking as well as the characteristics and the rules of changes in thinking among young officers and soldiers .  We must strengthen our studies on major theoretical and practical issues that will have impacts on the thinking activities among officers and soldiers .  We should have an initiative in carrying out the ideological and political work .  
The two countries have maintained close political contacts and consultations , and have brought about a constant growth to their economic relations and trade ; what is more , our two countries have reached agreements on a number of major cooperative projects during a recent period , and this will surely produce a far-reaching influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries .  
China and Germany share same or similar views on a series of major international issues , their economies are highly complementary , and a wide-ranging cooperation has already been established in all fields which enjoys a solid foundation .  Therefore , a further development to our friendly relations enjoys huge potentials and a broad prospect .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
After the all-out civil war broke out , the party again made in a timely fashion a set of correct policy decisions in light of the major changes taking place in the situation at home and abroad , which helped achieve victory in the war of liberation and found New China .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
5 .  All sides reaffirm their determination to jointly crack down on national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism that constitute major threats to regional peace , stability , and development and on such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in weapons and narcotics and illegal migration .  To this end , the five countries will draw up relevant multilateral outlines as early as possible ;  
The meeting of the five countries ' heads of state held on 5 July in Dushanbe is a major event in the history of the Eurasian continent .  The " Dushanbe Statement " signed jointly by the five countries ' heads of state marks an excellent beginning of cooperation among the five countries in the new century which fully reflects the common wishes of the people of the five countries to be always friendly toward each other and to become eternal " good neighbors , good partners , and good friends . "  
The two sides will , in accordance with the laws of respective countries and bilateral agreements , encourage and protect mutual investment , strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between relevant departments of the two countries , create favorable economic , financial and legal conditions , as well as other conditions , for cooperation between major trade and economic bodies of the two countries , and provide them with necessary support .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : China made major achievements in various national economic and social undertakings in 1999 .  The final accounts of central and local governments were rather good , with central financial revenue continuing to maintain a fine growth momentum .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The Chinese Communist Party believes that the guiding role of the state-owned economy is mainly embodied in its ability to control .  The state-owned economy should have a dominant role in key areas and major industries which are the lifeline of the national economy .  Other areas can have adjustments such as " advance and retreat " and " let some things go undone , " with the proportion which is the state-owned economy reduced somewhat with no effect on the socialist nature of China .  
Most of the major economic indicators broke out of the downward trend that had persisted for many years , with exports growing strongly , consumption expenditure rising , fixed assets investment having moved out of the trough , and all of the three major types of demand that drive the economy seeing growth .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
We should sum up in good time the new experiences and new understanding gained by the party and the people in the course of practice , give scientific , convincing , and realistic interpretations and explanations of major ideological and theoretical problems raised in practical life which concern the cadres and masses , and give full play to the basic role of theory in ideological and political work .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
An authoritative source pointed out that since the start of the year , the upward trend of Chinas main economic index shows that within this year it is expected to reverse the economic trend of the past seven years , particularly the last three years .  Economic development has witnessed a major rebound and is moving toward a positive cycle .  
To avoid the possible economic downturn and to maintain sustained rapid healthy national economic development , the central authorities have resolutely made major policy decisions to expand domestic demand and implement the proactive fiscal policy .  
all this has affected the efficiency of the funds from the issue of government bonds .  In the management of state-owned enterprises , the efficiency of such enterprises is improved , and fresh achievements have been made in reducing losses and increasing profits ; however , major accidents concerning safety have occurred one after another , and internal factors such as changing enterprises ' operating mechanism and improving their management are to be strengthened .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
strive to research and find answers for new and major strategic issues on the party and national development and major ideological and theoretical issues in practical life the cadres and people are concerned about ; bring into full play the basic role of theory in ideological and theoretical work ; and bring about theoretical progress in promoting social development and realize the value of theory in satisfying the people 's needs .  
The participants unanimously held that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's speech was a brilliant exposition and very rich in content .  It was strongly political and theoretical in nature and it stressed the important position of theoretical work .  It put forward the tasks and demands on theoretical work , and explained a series of major theoretical and practical fundamental issues that concern the overall situation .  
In theoretical work , we must uphold the emancipation of the mind , do practical work , and closely link our work to actual conditions .  We must apply the Marxist stance , viewpoint , and method to make scientific , convincing , and practical explanations of major ideological and theoretical issues that the cadres and masses are concerned about , so as to unify thoughts and forces .  
Yu Yongbo said emphatically : The important speech given by Chairman Jiang at the central ideological and political work conference profoundly expounded on a host of major issues in strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation .  A policy document of great theoretical and guiding significance , the speech further pointed the way for us to cope with the overall situation of party and government work and to do a good job in ideological and political work in the military .  
6 .  The two countries affirm their identical stands on major international issues .  They hold that international relations in the 21st century should be built on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the established norms of international law , and the dominant position on the United Nations in international affairs should be preserved and strengthened .  They advocate that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means , and that relations between states should be developed on the basis of the " UN Charter " and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997 , in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation , by judging the hour and sizing up the situation , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council firmly came up with such a major policy decision as expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy .  Expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy have since played a crucial and key role in sustaining stable economic growth ;

Li Lanqing said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , as China 's building of socialist spiritual civilization was further strengthened , the literary and artistic undertaking was flourishing in all fields , and the good athletes obtained excellent achievements in some major international games .

Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
Grasping development as the main theme , Tianjin has three great historic tasks to fulfill at the start of the new century : to build a modern international port city and a major economic center of north China ; to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economy structure ; and to become one of the regions in the lead in basically achieving modernization .  
To do this , we must start from the standpoint of actual conditions in Guizhou , suiting measures to local conditions and giving full play to strong points while avoiding weaknesses , facing the market and actively adjusting economic structures , relying on science and technology , and devoting major efforts toward developing distinctive industries so as to transform the plethora of natural resources into an economic advantage .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " sums up our nation 's abundant practical economic experience , identifies the major problems to be resolved as well as the major areas for development , and proposes a direction in which to work and corresponding policy measures .  For example , with respect to strengthening the basic position of agriculture and promoting the comprehensive development of the rural economy , the ' outline ' makes 6 policy decisions : Protect and improve grain production capacity ; expand areas in which rural people can increase their income ;  
Under the conditions of a socialist market economy , carrying forward and developing the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation , giving rise to a sound common practice of respecting , providing for , assisting the elderly in society , and building up a harmonious relationship between different generations is a major content for our current socialist spiritual civilization building .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Whether we are drawing up policy for economic , social , or cultural development ; publishing a major reform measure ; or making laws , regulations , or rules , we must take into consideration the endeavor to combat corruption and promote clean administration as an organic component and must conduct argumentation on whether they are conducive to combating corruption and promoting clean administration so as to effect prior prevention .

Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
Li Peng said : The NPC Standing Committee must conscientiously exercise supervision over budgets and economic work in accordance with the law ; it must investigate , study , and put forward proposals on current major issues in the economic and social spheres , such as strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , increasing farmer income , reforming state-owned enterprises , increasing job opportunities , implementing the strategy of developing western regions on a massive scale , joining the World Trade Organization , and implementing the strategy of seeking sustainable development .

So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .

According to statistical information concerning body build among the three major racial groupings ( the Mongoloid or yellow ; the Caucasian or white ; and the Negroid or black ) Caucasian males are , on average , 1 meter 77 centimeters tall ( 5 feet 10 inches ) at maturity while Caucasian females have an average height of 1 meter 65 centimeters ( 5 feet 5 inches ) at maturity .  
The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
These two types of flower arrangement - - the former outgoing and extroverted , the latter self-contemplating and introverted - - are highly befitting examples of two major , contrasting Chinese attitudes towards life ; specifically , the socially oriented thought of the Confucianists and the reclusively individualistic philosophy of the Taoists , respectively .  
As a result , all the trivial chores of running an embassy - - showing slides , cooking and serving dinner , fixing toilets , paying the water bills - - have to be handled by the ambassador and one or two assistants , in addition to their major duties of keeping themselves informed of the local situation , negotiating with local officials , and serving overseas nationals .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
During his eight years at Chinese opera school , Ma threw himself with total energy into mastering the techniques of this demanding art , and he became an instant stage success after his graduation in 1959 . Unfortunately , in the political context of the time , his aristocratic family background proved to be a major stumbling block in his artistic career .  
Concerning the four major topics of civilization , war , city , and nature , this noble leader of modern spirit continues his mental perception and reflection . . . . In such a work as ' Song of Time and Space - - Looking at the Canton-Kowloon Railway in the Distance , ' Lomen courageously uncovers the fate of the Chinese people . It 's moving and may be considered a classical work in the modern Chinese epic . "  
The major material for their paintings consisted of metal oxides , iron oxide being the most commonly used . The use of metal oxides could produce red , blue , and yellow colors , and if heated , the colors would multiply .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
In Europe , which has a strong cultural background of its own , sinological research - - setting out from the tasks of translation and textual criticism - - was exceptionally solid and meticulous , and major figures continued to appear up until the middle of this century .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
In recent years , because of the rapid increase in the airline industry and the aging of planes built in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , major aircraft manufacturers in the U . S . and Europe have , unable to meet rising demand , made the newly industrialized countries partners in cooperation .  
ConclusionThe four major programs and eleven key areas reported on above are the most salient of the government 's current administrative plans , aimed in essence at outlining a blueprint for future national development , and I hope you will be unsparing in your criticism and suggestions with regard to any points that may be inappropriate .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung . The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
Environmental Conservation and ProtectionWorking under an overall plan , the Environmental Protection Administration of the Executive Yuan has taken several important steps since its establishment . It has actively promoted policy reform , set up a sound organizational system , strengthened administration and management , revised or drafted new laws and regulations , provided educational guidance , strictly controlled major sources of pollution , expanded engineering projects , developed technology for environmental protection , established an environmental evaluation system , and set guidelines for resolving disputes caused by pollution .  
Taiwan is situated on the border of two of the major regions into which entomologists divide the world , and its insects combine the special characteristics of both . In addition , the island was formed in geological isolation and evolved a number of unique in digenous species . Its butterfly specimens , as a result , are extremely rich and varied .  
The most important physical characteristics of the Mongoloid race are flat noses , prominent cheekbones , rather prominent eye sockets , straight black hair , tawny skin and slanted , or almond-shaped , eyes . There are thirteen major and minor characteristics in all , which will be examined in more detail in another article .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
What makes scientists even more worried is that acid rain can dissolve heavy metals , many of which are present in soil . Where for example aluminum is a major component of the soil , if the aluminum is dissolved it raises the concentration of heavy metal in the soil and will harm the root systems of plants . When it reaches a lake , the dissolved aluminum will turn into a granular colloid which damages the breathing systems of fish .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Water buffalos and Chinese cattle produce just enough to feed their calves , without any extra for people . Domestic livestock and poultry have always been a major source of animal protein , with the sole point in raising them being to fill our bellies . New , improved varieties with rapid growth , greater fecundity or better taste have won favor over time , and pure native strains that have n't been interbred have gradually declined in popularity or even face extinction .  
One major reason is that these diseases - - ulcers , high blood pressure , heart and arterial disease , and so on - - are not acute illnesses brought on by a single cause , as many past epidemic diseases were , but are chronic illnesses brought on by numerous factors , so it is relatively hard to clarify cause and effect relationships .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
Five years ago , a major battle was fought in the media between the natural ecology and communications construction . The result was that the " egg " ( the environment ) defeated the " stone . " The New Central Cross-Island Highway had originally been planned to cut across the Central Mountain Range to Yuli in Hualien . But because Yushan National Park was " a single man able to hold a narrow mountain pass against an army , " the plan was shrunk so that the road became the park 's " scenic highway . "  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
Opening International Doors : In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , situated on a quiet section of Chieh Shou Rd . , the phones in the international organizations department are constantly ringing , the staff is busily poring through documents , and officials involved in major diplomatic initiatives are streaming in and out , swinging open the thick wooden door .  
Nevertheless , since ancient times major affairs of state have been seen as the center of political activity , and are what most people think of when they think of ' politics , ' " says Yeh . This is a distortion of a paternalistic society - - promoting invasiveness , and lacking in acceptance and tolerance - - which defined the political core , but it is by no means the only or normal nature of politics .  
Even more tragic is that over the past two year , with a strategy of doing low-cost contracting , Sampo has attained substantial sales for air conditioners there . Unfortunately , in so doing it evoked the envy of the Japanese industry . Matsushita and Mitsubishi , major manufacturers of the compressor , an essential part , cut the supply in half . " We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
Unwilling to bring production : In primitive times Puli was a vast lake ; later the water disappeared , leaving a basin filled with extremely rich lake-bottom soil . This made Puli into a main agricultural center in Central Taiwan , with the major claims to fame being red sugar cane and bamboo shoots .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
But unless some major revisions are made to this promising star of tomorrow - - so you can fold it like an umbrella and store it away when not in use - - the electric car will provide no solution for traffic jams and parking hassles . Going to work electronically : Therefore , some people are casting aside the model of thinking wherein motion necessarily involves people , vehicles and roads to look for a substitute for vehicles .  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Super alliance to explore new industrial worlds : T . H . Steve Chao , deputy director of the Visual Information Technology Division at the CCRL , who has been responsible for laying the groundwork for this alliance , notes that HDTV will be the main-stream of global visual technology in the future . The key relevant technologies include high speed digital signal handling spun off from computer technology , high resolution imaging , and so on ; this will be a major revolution in the visual industry .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
When some of the ridiculous aspects of contemporary funerals are mentioned , Hsu Fu-chuan , a professor at the Taiwan Institute of Technology who has studied quite a bit about traditional funeral rites , ca n't help but sigh . Birth and death are major events in the lives of any individual , yet are also important for socialization . The only thing is , in today 's changing society , who will pass these ceremonies along ?  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
Candidate , candidate . . . , incompetent , incompetent . . . , fall off the horse when you try to ride . . . . " From its origins as a game in which children rode on a stick horse , the puma troupe has gone from the traditional imperial examination candidate riding a red horse following a deity around to today 's riding of a white horse being sent along with the deceased to ride the clouds . This extreme development of riding with abandon through heaven and hell is a major transformation in yi-chen .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
His chance finally came in June of that year when an injured foreign player for the Giants was put on the disabled list . This freed up a spot on the major league roster , and Lu filled it . " I did n't think I 'd play for a while after coming up , " Lu recalls , " and was caught by surprise when manager Wang Chen-chih put me in the starting lineup . "  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards . It is estimated that the main veins were all worked out within less than 20 years . All this gold was shipped back to Japan , where it became a major source of finance for the imperial army 's purchases of military equipment from abroad .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient . This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
When building a city in ancient China , the government would often maintain large tracts of open space within the city , containing farmland , gardens , wooded hills and springs . This was done not entirely to avert crisis if enemies surrounded the city . Nor were these vast tracts awaiting future development . Instead they would be developed as parks or major sight-seeing spots ( especially where there was water ) , and they would become much loved by city folk .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
During the early period when the Consumer 's Foundation dominated the landscape , all the major newspapers had a reporter specially assigned to the " Consumer 's Foundation beat " to capture their latest move at any time . Undoubtedly , this was the principal buttress to the Consumer 's Foundations ' widespread fame . After a number of restrictions on periodicals were lifted , the thickness of news publications expanded rapidly .  
For example , just prior to the major provincial and municipal elections at the end of last year , Mary Tseng , secretary-general of the Wild Bird Society of Taipei , organized their semi-annual waterfowl festival in Kuantu . The Wild Bird Society invited candidates from all three major parties to take part in the huge gathering . Of course , the harvest was bountiful - - at the event all three parties ' candidates promised once elected to build a nature preserve in Kuantu .  
NGOs to date have no effective channels to participate in the countless detailed activities of public administration that are underway on a daily basis . Nevertheless , NGO personnel may indeed be recruited by specialized consultative committees to help formulate policy for major issues .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Bruce Yang , who was a rehabilitation specialist at a major hospital in southern Taiwan , explains that physicians who are able to migrate to New Zealand are mostly already respected doctors at large hospitals in Taiwan , but to requalify in New Zealand they have to take examinations in both clinical practice and basic theory . Even if they do manage to pass and obtain a license to practice , they then have to serve a probationary period as junior hospital doctors .  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
This pragmatic approach may be the model for the future presence in Hong Kong of the countries which maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei . The loss of a major diplomatic partner is a blow to the ROC 's hopes for " dual recognition , " and also reveals the cruel and unsentimental nature of international politics .  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
The White Paper on Youth released by the Executive Yuan 's National Youth Commission two years ago gave the results of a survey , showing that of parental attitudes toward their children , exploitation or abuse , too-severe discipline , contradictory parent-ing , differences in opinion between the two parents , breakdown of the family unit , worsening of the atmosphere in the family , low social status of parents , and incorrect values and attitudes toward society were the major factors leading to juvenile crime .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
The Assembly session sparked contention throughout society : It touched on major issues of the power of the president and premier , and of the existence of the provincial government . There were divisions of opinion among and within the three main political parties . Scholars engaged in heated debate , and citizens took to the streets .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Activities on the tour included both highly refined traditional live budaixi and contemporary TV budaixi . HEPP wisely invited ethnologists-who have wide connections in the field of traditional culture-to organize the event . As a result , virtually all the major puppet theater families from all over Taiwan were brought together . In the world of budaixi , where each " school " carefully distinguishes itself from its competitors , this was truly unprecedented .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
Volunteer organizations , on the other hand , took aim at people 's desire to " do some good " and arranged even more volunteer activities for them . Meanwhile , the continuing education departments of many universities scheduled additional weekend classes . Figures involved in athletics were also excited , seeing the two extra Saturdays a month as an opportunity to finally begin building the sort of " athletic pyramid " that all the major sporting nations have .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
On the heels of legal rulings that granted mothers greater rights to the custody of children and wives equal rights to a couple 's shared assets , Taiwan 's women 's groups in April of this year celebrated another victory when a decision by the Grand Council of Justices granted wives " the freedom to choose their place of residence . " The ruling represented another major step on the road toward equal rights in the ROC .  
Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
Just as there are major gaps in outsiders ' understanding of aboriginal culture in general , more detailed research needs to be carried out about the mathematical conceptions of aborigines . This research should be broken down according to age , tribe , area , social situation , and so forth . It 's wrong to make a sweeping generalization and say that " aborigines ' poor performance in math is or is not related to culture , " argues Wang Wei-chang , a photographer who often visits aboriginal communities .  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Forty or fifty years ago , acute bacterial and viral diseases were the major cause of death in Taiwan . Today , they have been replaced by cancer and cerebrovascular disease . However , the threat from infectious diseases has not disappeared .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
Mr . Koo did not avoid politically sensitive issues , clearly and unambiguously giving voice to the Republic of China 's political principles . And by avoiding the mainland 's trap , Mr . Koo expanded the scope of the dialogue to include the rights of the people and lured the mainland into agreeing to four points of consensus set by Taiwan . While working within the major differences outlined above , the two sides together sought out minor points to agree upon .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
These periodicals and books are of a very high standard and have a respected position in international sinology . Their diverse content includes economics , literature ( both classical and modern ) , politics , history , philosophy and so on . These publications constitute a major textual resource for academic research .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
In A Comparison of Chinese and Western Conceptions of Human Rights , the legal scholar Chang Yi-ting holds that Chinese society uses the power of ethics and morality to create a harmonious society . This is an exalted ideal of Confucianism and is also a major reason why there is no record of Chinese in ancient times fighting for human rights .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
Another new style is " taiji-daoyin , " a 12-movement routine refined from traditional taijiquan by the well-known practitioner Hsiung Wei . Taiji-daoyin , which is easy to begin learning and requires a minimal amount of space for practice , has already been adopted as a keep-fit exercise by major corporations such as Acer , as well as being extended into modern dance and applied as a surprising new form of " Chinese-style dance workout . "  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
People are forgetful , and as the nightmare of 21 September fades from memory , getting citizens to remain prudent and vigilant will be easier said than done . A recent survey in Japan , which had been on " full alert " after the Kobe earthquake , revealed that 34% of the public had made no special preparations whatsoever for a major earthquake-a full ten percentage points more than in a survey two years ago .  
Master Hongyi is the fourth major work that Siong Leng has put on since 1993 . The story line departs significantly from the typical love stories featured in most nanguan works , and Siong Leng also breaks significant new musical ground by moving beyond the standard four instruments ( pipa , dongxiao , sanxian , and erxian ) to include an entire Chinese orchestra . The group also parts from tradition by incorporating folk dances into the play .  
This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term . Their writing reflected the grandiose Zeitgeist of the Han Empire , and became the major form of Han literature .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
Lien also stated that all political party assets would be put into a blind trust , and that political parties would never again engage in running businesses for a profit . Lien 's " third wave of reform " has six major objectives , including achievement of " clean and competent government , " " a justice system dedicated to true justice , " " a greater role for the national legislature and an overhaul of the National Assembly , " and " the preservation of basic human rights . "  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe . " The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented . In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
The year before last , the United Nations nominated over 20 ecologically important areas worldwide as biosphere reserves , to be the subject of major conservation efforts with the support of the international community . But although East Asia was recognized as one of the regions of greatest biodiversity , a lack of detailed species lists and ecological background data prevented many areas being listed .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
The situation is also problematic in Africa , another major diplomatic base for Taiwan . Domestic turbulence is rife in Liberia and other countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan , and see-saw struggles between opposing camps pose a big threat to our diplomatic relations . It is said that diplomacy is the extension of national power .  
Apex 's major product at the moment , the alternating pressure pump mattress , is aimed at preventing bedsores , a real nightmare for bedridden patients . Bedsores result from hard mattresses causing parts of the body that bear the most weight ( such as the buttocks and the shoulders ) to be deprived of oxygen and consequently suffer necrosis ( i.e . tissue death ) . This is accompanied by ulceration , suppuration and infestation , from which recovery is very difficult .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
" A design based on the cooling techniques used in jet engines would definitely be much more effective than the typical electric fans now in use , and would be less costly to manufacture , " explains Lai . Currently a major computer manufacturer in Taiwan has acquired the design patent to this kind of technology , which will be applied to the production of as many as 200,000 notebook computers a year .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
In recent years , every major meeting among industrialized nations having anything to do with economic globalization has been accompanied by rioting and protests . In particular , the huge riots in Seattle in 1999 have ignited a big upsurge in opposition to globalization . The G8 summit held this past July in Genoa , Italy was besieged by over 100,000 protesters .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River . It formed a natural dam 100 meters high , and created a new lake , Lake Tsaoling , with a volume of 12.86 million cubic meters .  
Lo Liu-chih points out that the collared bush robins that live on the ground in the forest understory mainly nest on grassy slopes , where as well as being exposed to major airborne predators such as raptors and crows , they are also apt to attract the attention of land animals such as weasels and rock monkeys . " Large creatures like weasels , birds of prey or nutcrackers may be more sensitive to traffic , and more easily frightened by human activity , " says Lo Liu-chih .  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Cheng 's songs became popular in spite of not having been commercially distributed , demonstrating the resiliency that Taiwanese music has gained by being rooted in the hearts of the people . Although the major record labels are facing tough times and releasing fewer albums , many artists are still getting their work to the public through independent labels .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
All visitors to Lukang inevitably go exploring . Besides the three major historic sites mentioned earlier , when you stroll through the narrow streets , even without deliberately looking , you just need to raise your head and you will frequently see exquisitely carved plafonds , decorative ceramic window frames , and vases inlayed into walls , providing a stream of delightful surprises .  
In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
In an unexpected development in this connection , to escape debt obligations a major shareholder in a venture-capital firm who has close ties with the ruling DPP has alleged the existence of a complex network of interlocking party and business funds involving illicit kickbacks to members of several different parties .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
We 're not afraid of competition . The more people in Taiwan get into this industry the better , for strength comes from solidarity . " Eric Lee , president of Softstar Entertainment , a major local computer games company , says that companies such as Softstar , Wang Film and CGCG have already formed a strategic alliance . They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
The book indicates the positions of " reflex zones " on the feet that correspond to the organs of the urinary , digestive , circulatory and immune systems , and states that the nerve endings in these reflex zones are linked to the major organs of the body . People 's feet spend months and years closed up in " shoe hell , " so that the blood circulation is restricted , and this can easily lead to poor health .  
Choreographers often take their inspiration for flamenco dances from the popular opera " Carmen , " which tells the tale of a gypsy girl . Oddly enough , flamenco is just the opposite of Western classical music in that the dark and moody music ( such as soleares ) is in a major key , while bulerias and other music in minor keys is up tempo .  
The final major focus is miniature fuel cells .

erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Further requests the Secretary-General to elaborate his proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly and summit-level meetings of a representative character , on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue , taking into consideration the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , [ 3 ] / the outcome of the ongoing discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development , and on restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ;  
Although resident coordinators had a key role to play , they should be assisted by ensuring that the local representatives of other entities engaged in operational activities consulted them regarding the implementation of major programmes and by authorizing the resident coordinators to propose to the heads of those entities the amendment of country programmes and major projects , where required , to bring them into line with the country strategy note , in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 .

were only two solutions : one would be for the current system to be radically changed so as to incorporate the specialized agencies as major players in determining conditions of service for the staff ; the other would be to allow the staff of the specialized agencies and technical programmes to develop their own system so that they could get on with the important tasks that needed to be addressed urgently .  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,

Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
was noted that Administration was reactive rather than proactive , seldom utilized essential management practices , such as benchmarks for major administrative services providing clear indications of the time for processing administrative actions , and lacked written instructions or manuals on internal administrative procedure .  
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
of the Committee would recall the difficult discussions which had taken place at recent major multilateral trade and economic negotiations on measures to preserve cultural industries and the provisions made in some documents , such as those of the Copenhagen Summit , requiring that liberalized and multifaceted economic actions , including structural adjustment , should be tempered by prudent considerations which reflected the concern to minimize the harm which could be caused to the populations to which they would be applied .  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Supreme Council expressed its deep appreciation and gratitude to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman and to the Government and people of the Sultanate of Oman for the gracious hospitality and sincere sentiments of brotherhood with which the leaders of the Cooperation Council were received and commended the distinguished arrangements and important role played by His Majesty as President of the current session of the Supreme Council and his excellent conduct of the meetings , which had a major impact on arrival at the important and fruitful conclusions achieved at this session .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
In this context , the major tool utilized by public administration in its work should not be decisions taken on an individual basis , but regulations intended to create mechanisms and frameworks within which independent activity can take place and social and economic entities can produce initiatives .  
In contrast with Europe , the absence of a middle class able to launch the process of economic and social development , the weakness of the industrial fabric , the well-known inadequacy of public facilities and national structure were , at the time of independence , major challenges to be met .  Hence the need for State intervention , including through protectionism , to modify the nature of comparative advantages .  
This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , 6 / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the United Nations Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook , and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions where they occur ;  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
We are living in a world in which events are occurring that would have been unimaginable just a short while ago , major political changes in international relations that prompt us to rethink international law .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In order to effect such an integrated scheme of cooperation along the lines I have just outlined , my delegation believes that the institution of inter-agency task forces , as established by the Administrative Committee on Coordination , can be a major channel through which participating agencies can engage in constructive dialogue for the purpose of ensuring close cooperation in effectively implementing the Programme of Action . Intensified efforts for coordination and cooperation are very much desired .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
In paragraph 42 of the report of the Secretary - General , we read that the Commission has already established an Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Nevertheless , we are aware that there have been shortfalls that are concealed by misleading national averages , as a result of the difficulties and contrasts of major social disparities and the children who are victims of exploitation , of physical and emotional violence , and of abandonment and injustice .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
New and necessary foundations have been laid between two of the world 's major collegiate bodies , which have the privilege to have among their ranks enlightened spokespersons from all over the world , which constantly seek the same ideal of harmony and coexistence on the vast and glorious stage formed by all the continents , and which raise their voices in this Hall for the supreme ideal of peace .  
While recognizing that primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the IAEA to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance and its continuing work in fostering a global nuclear safety culture , and recognizes its contribution to future work under the Convention on Nuclear Safety , which is a major accomplishment in this field .  
Fourthly , bearing in mind the major aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of our country 's economic and social development , we would once more like to stress that our country is supporting the Agency 's measures for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime , within the context of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
This is particularly true since the United Nations Charter , in our view a view shared by many others still represents a major instrument governing international life , and since any international order , be it old or new , must be based on a solid foundation that respects rights , determines obligations and opens the door to an era of interaction among societies on the basis of acceptance and understanding , not imposition or oppression .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .  
World wide , fossil fuels have continued to be the dominant primary energy source for electricity generation , with coal accounting for the major share and likely to remain so well into the next century , although hydro and nuclear energy have made tangible progress in many countries .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guarani , the predominant aboriginal language .  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
The Committee acknowledged the State party 's initiatives to provide bilingual education but expressed its concern at the inadequacy of those initiatives , which posed a major obstacle to women 's access to social and economic opportunities , since a large percentage of the female population spoke only Guaran , the predominant aboriginal language .  
In conclusion , the Commission may wish to note that , historically , major socio-economic changes ( comparable to the scale of change required to restructure production and consumption in industrialized countries ) have occurred as a response to perceived opportunities ( for example , widespread availability of affordable cars ) not to government prescription .  
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : ( a ) the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process , including national reconciliation efforts ; ( b ) the breakdown of mutual support systems ; ( c ) the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; ( d ) the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; ( e ) the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the continuous and major publications of the Department of Public Information [ 4 ] / and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that its output contains adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
We reaffirm our commitment to South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national , regional and global development and as a major mechanism for the promotion of growth and accelerated development , including human resource development , and affirm the importance of holding the ninth session of IFCC during 1995 , and our full support for the convening of a United Nations Conference on south-south cooperation in 1997 .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
The coordination of human rights activities throughout the United Nations system was the subject of debate in the framework of the coordination segment of the Economic and Social Council ( 26-30 June 1995 ) which had on its agenda coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields . 
Conduct a strategic needs analysis in the area of supply of goods and services for the Organization and specifically , for field missions , including the related contracting procedures , determining distinctive characteristics of the required procurement action , in particular in support of rapid deployment of new operations and major expansion of existing ones ; ( b ) Undertake a systematic in-depth review of :  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity , the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General , as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The plan has received strong interest from numerous major industrial corporations , national Governments , environmental groups and international agencies .  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) , UNEP and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( UNITAR ) organized their second training course on environmental law and policy ( March / April 1995 ) , designed to familiarize 30 government lawyers and officials from all geographical regions with the provisions of major environmental instruments , and to compose national legislative strategies for implementing relevant conventions .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
Thus , according to information received from the Secretariat , the compensation to troop-contributing countries for expenses incurred for inland transportation of major equipment beyond the first 800 kilometres along the consignment route from the home location of the equipment to the point of embarkation would be a one-time payment of an amount equal to 0.25 per cent of the monthly wet lease rates for major equipment for each additional complete 800 kilometres .  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
2 During the reporting period , the international community paid increased attention to the illicit traffic in , and abuse of , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , acknowledged to be a major threat to the fabric of society and the security of States .  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
All documented sources , including those of the information media and the international relief organizations , have confirmed that it is Uganda that provides support and that it is the major source arming the insurgency and supplying it with men and logistic , military and political support and providing transit access to all the forces and parties that are supporting the insurgency . 
In cooperation with specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations , the Mission will take part in the clearance and verification of heavily mined areas throughout the territory , particularly the main supply routes between the major regional areas and Luanda , which are considered paramount in the deployment of UNAVEM III and the free circulation of goods and persons .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
That has required close coordination of macroeconomic policies among major industrial countries to prevent the harmful effects on national economies of any adverse market reactions to actual or perceived changes in national economic situations and associated policies . 
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
In the field of labour a major method is racketeering , a term used to describe a variety of tactics such as engaging in fraudulent deals or extortion through intimidation and blackmail or the abuse of legitimate positions for illegitimate ends , as in the case of businessmen or labour union and government officials .  In the field of vice , organized crime engages in trafficking in women , which involves international prostitution and sexual slavery .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
An individual in Iraq ( the Director-General of a major missile establishment ) alleged to be responsible for this acquisition , stated that he had destroyed , in August 1995 , all guidance and control components received and had informed Iraq 's governmental authorities on two occasions , in August and October 1995 , about the receipt of these proscribed items .  
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues , and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
Four main developments are addressed here : ( a ) the programmatic reports of the Secretary-General on an Agenda for Peace and an Agenda for Development ; ( b ) the cycle of international conferences on pressing issues and their outcome before the international community ; ( c ) the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and related activities ; and ( d ) the Secretary-General 's initiative to launch The United Nations Blue Book Series , documenting the active role and the legacy of the United Nations in resolving major issues .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
Acting together under the auspices of ECE , member Governments have developed over the years a set of major international legal instruments in the field of transport that establish appropriate international regulations , norms and standards , facilitate border crossing and provide for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks for road , rail , inland waterways and combined transport .  
A fifth objective of the subprogramme will be to monitor international situations and trends as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the work of the Organization by major media networks , to ensure that the Secretary-General and senior officials of the Organization are kept informed of developments on the international scene in a comprehensive and timely manner .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Ensuring that due priority is given and adequate resources made available , at the national , regional and international levels , to combat the threat to individual and public health posed by the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS globally and by the re-emergence of major diseases , such as tuberculosis , malaria , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and diarrhoeal diseases , in particular cholera ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
In order to develop the regional capabilities to foresee effectively upcoming trends and challenges , the fourth objective is to facilitate monitoring and assessing of new development processes and their projections , including summaries of major projected global trends in aspects that are relevant to the region .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 264 and Council decision 1996 / 203 , the coordination segment of the Council should also be devoted to the consideration of the implementation of the agreed conclusions on the theme of the 1995 coordination segment of the Council relating to the coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the review of publications by the Department of Public Information [ 1 ] / and urges all efforts be made to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , and taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization , reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
This report is in follow-up to agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , which were approved by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1995 ( see A / 50 / 3 , chap .  
The prime objective of the task forces is to assure that adequate support from the headquarters level is provided to the resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams in each country so that they may , in full consultation with national Governments , facilitate a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences ( para . 39 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 ) .  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
The executive secretaries of the regional economic commissions will be asked to produce a product analogous to that requested of the resident coordinator , focusing on regional aspects of the major thrusts of United Nations system activities in the regional level .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
ECLAC has made major efforts over the past five years to develop a more efficient and effective secretariat through more streamlined organization , cost-saving measures , rigorous programming , training , improving horizontal and vertical communication between staff , and enhancing responsibility and accountability on the part of individual staff members and organizational units .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
Despite the satisfactory economic performance and the progress and acceleration of reconstruction , Israel 's continuous occupation of south Lebanon and its continued aggression against Lebanon and its citizens remain the major obstacle to comprehensive national recovery . 
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
That had made it possible to implement policies which were better adapted to local conditions in the areas of health and education , particularly in the provinces of the North and the Iles Loyaut , controlled by the FLNKS , which had succeeded in catching up to a considerable extent in the areas of infrastructure and public services , and achieving major progress in the economic sphere .  
The major changes in the world , which have eliminated confrontation between blocs , have already had an impact on the situation in the Mediterranean region , where the outlines of a peaceful future are beginning to take shape : the Middle East peace process is proceeding , although with considerable difficulty ; the move towards peace in the Balkans is continuing ; and there is a growing understanding of the importance of establishing regional cooperation for economic growth and rescuing the environment of the Mediterranean basin . 
Considerable international technical and financial assistance is provided by the housing cooperative movement in developed countries ; for example , for 44 years , the United States Cooperative Housing Foundation has supported projects in 90 countries , and is currently active in 30 , including major projects in South Africa and Poland . CECODHAS and ICA Housing work energetically in support of housing cooperatives in the transitional economies . 
The traditional approach to funding ECE / FAO work on temperate and boreal forest resource assessment has been a cooperative approach in which member countries and certain organizations have provided major contributions , mostly in kind , and a very small secretariat team has played a coordinating and assembling role with a limited amount of analytical and validation work ; this is a natural and justified approach in a region where most counties have rather well-developed forest inventory capacity .  
While an eco-regional approach may facilitate scientific understanding , it is widely recognized that there is a need to ensure early endorsement of recommended action by intergovernmental forums or major political groupings , since political and policy-level acceptance is a precondition for lasting national commitment and continued country-level implementation .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
Realizing the increasingly important role of indigenous people and youth in solving the major problems facing humankind and the need to provide them with broader opportunities to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , cultural , spiritual and moral life of their peoples , as partners in development ,  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
Throughout the country , inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government are major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance and thus slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of tragedy in other areas .  
Community-based animal health workers continued to vaccinate cattle against rinderpest - a major cattle-killing disease - and treat other major livestock diseases of the south : contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia , trypanosomiasis , liver fluke , anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia .  
Drug abuse has devastating social effects , including its harmful impact on youth , families , other social groups and the workplace , and adverse health consequences as well , including those resulting from the relationship between substance abuse and a number of major diseases and disorders and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) .  
The international community reached a consensus and committed itself to the goal of poverty eradication at the major United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative .  
" Noting with regret the continued decline in official development assistance devoted to the implementation and follow-up of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields ,

Urges all member States to honour their commitments , particularly with respect to the provision of adequate resources , to ensure full implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic , social and related fields and to continue considering the vital issue of mobilizing new and additional resources , including new and innovative sources of financing , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the programmes of action of the major international conferences ;  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
By its resolution 50 / 227 of 24 May 1996 on further measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the General Assembly decided that in the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of major conferences , the Council should ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
At its substantive session in 1996 , the Council adopted resolution 1996 / 36 of 26 July 1996 on follow-up to the major international United Nations conferences and summits , including the implementation of their respective programmes of action , and decided that it should continue to ensure , on a regular basis , the harmonization and coordination of the multi-year work programmes of relevant functional commissions by promoting a clear division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them .  
The Commission also established the Expert Group on the Statistical Implications of Recent Major United Nations Conferences to draw up a work programme reflecting the major action areas identified by the Summit and indicators where international statistical work in the social field should be concentrated .  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
At its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved its agreed conclusions ( 1995 / 1 ) on coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and the implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields .  
At its organizational meeting ( 22 March 1996 ) , the Task Force decided to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned with an aim : ( a ) to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development ; ( b ) to establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment ; and ( c ) to provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .

Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
At the meeting results of studies on the large-scale use of bednets treated with insecticide were reviewed , major issues relevant to wider promotion of bednets were discussed , along with some of the operational experiences , and major operational research priorities were identified .  A basic scenario for the implementation of sustained malaria control involving the use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and other materials was outlined .  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
In many recent articles , major British newspapers have reported overt United States interference in Iraq 's internal affairs and the fact that the CIA employs numerous " assets " inside Iraq to carry out clandestine operations against Iraq 's national Government .  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
In many countries , although scarcity is less of a problem at the national level , overuse of groundwater , contributing to waterlogging and salinity , has become a major problem in specific regions , such as northern China , western and southern India and parts of Mexico . 
It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
The strengthening of the monitoring , internal audit , inspection and evaluation , and investigation functions provided for in the resolution is an important and integral part of the Secretary-General 's management plan , as outlined in his current and his previous annual reports on the work of the Organization , and is all the more essential at a time of major resource constraints .  
In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
During the last 40 years , the Congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  
While the Bureau agreed that the rules of procedure needed to be fully respected and that specific decisions on the participation of major groups in the session would be taken by the General Assembly , it also agreed that a number of activities could be organized during the special session with a view to ensuring effective input of major groups and their active inter-action with government representatives .  
During the fifth session of the Commission , one possibility would be to organize , in parallel with the drafting groups that will work on the text of the final document of the special session , hearings involving representatives of Governments , major groups and eminent persons , devoted to an assessment of the existing and potential role , and contribution to its implementation , of each of the major groups identified in Agenda 21 .  
The major tasks to be addressed in the post-election phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina 's economic development include , inter alia , rapid installation of State institutions , implementation of sound macroeconomic policies , adoption of a legislative framework conducive to the transition to a market economy and continuing the reconstruction efforts .  
However , it would be unfair to put the rebel groups , no matter what their role in the violence has been , on the same footing as a State which has ratified the major international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law and is therefore bound by strict obligations . 
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
The Summit noted that the prevailing situation in Angola is the remaining major obstacle to total regional stability within the SADC region which is seriously hindering the joint development programmes of the region , and , in this context urged UNITA to commit itself to peace and democracy in Angola so as to contribute effectively to the establishment of a new era of peace and cooperation in southern Africa . 
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
In his special report , the Commissioner-General draws attention to the critical state of UNRWA 's finances , the serious structural deficit facing the Agency , the austerity measures already taken to reduce the deficit as much as possible , the impact of the measures on the quality and level of services to Palestine refugees and the implications of the reduction of services for the stability of the area .  3 .  The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
The Secretary-General stated that enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations requires further improvement in the coordination and focus of its development activities and that it was essential that this effort be guided by a clear set of priorities and strategies identified by the General Assembly , with the support of the Economic and Social Council , that incorporate the outcomes of recent major international conferences . 
The Secretary-General attached special importance to the role of the Council in promoting a coordinated and integrated follow-up to major international conferences , and was confident that the outcome of the Council 's work in 1996 would further enhance its responsibility to draw together in a coherent framework the results of all major United Nations conferences to ensure that they guide the activities of the United Nations system .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .  
While civil servants in organs working directly with the humanitarian community are familiar with the respective roles played by the organizations , senior government officials told the Representative that apart from a few major agencies , other organizations and their activities were unknown to them . 
The series fills a real gap on the human-rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
Starting in 1995 , political and economic transition in Mozambique has shown promising signs of a return to stability and normality : peace , national reconciliation and the vitality of the young democracy have taken root ; parliamentary performance improved noticeably ; one has witnessed an open , free and lively interface between government , legislature and media ; overall the social climate remained calm ; resettlement of internally displaced people and returning refugees was consolidated ; reintegration of demobilized soldiers has been relatively free of major disruption ;  
In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
The United Nations system had been a major actor in promoting a holistic approach to development - linking social , economic and environmental considerations - in all the developing countries , as evidenced by the organization and outcome of a number of international conferences , especially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the International Conference on Population and Development , the World Summit for Social Development , and the Fourth World Conference on Women . 
The outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women had met the desire of the international community for a comprehensive programme of collective international action to change the prevailing situation of women in many parts of the world while taking account of the religious concepts and principles and the spiritual values that played a major role in the lives of peoples and in ensuring their stability .  
Welcomes action at the national and regional level by small island developing States , and invites all Governments , with the assistance of international and regional organizations , to continue to support and to provide information on all of their major activities under the Programme of Action so as to enable an adequate review of the aforementioned action taken at the national and regional level ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
It fully supported the work of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights and commended the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , whose work had enhanced the capacity of the United Nations to face the major challenges in that field , particularly in the wake of the World Conference on Human Rights which had declared human rights to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated .

Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .

Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .

All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
Against this background , the preparation of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has to be welcomed as a major step forward at the international level in translating many of the recommendations contained in the above _ mentioned Council of Europe text , into binding internatonal norms , thus protecting children more effectively against the various forms of sexual exploitation .

Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;  
A number of major causes of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to be removed and it is only the continuing sound international presence , both military and civilian , that can prevent the resumption of hostilities even on a minor scale .  
Underlines that the primary responsibility for the further successful implementation of the peace process lies with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves , which during the next two years should assume increasingly a greater responsibility for the functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international community , and stresses that without compliance and active participation by all the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in rebuilding a civil society they can not expect the international community and major donors to continue shouldering the political , military and economic burden of the implementation and reconstruction efforts ;

M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
The establishment of an international criminal court would be a monumental advance , affording , at last , genuine international jurisdictional protection to some of the world 's major legal achievements . 
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .

While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .

At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the area of education and literacy , and health , in particular for maternal and child health and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  233 .  Among the key characteristics of the United Nations are its universal membership and comprehensive mandate .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
As indicated in the proclamation of the Supreme Council for the Defence of Afghanistan and duly reflected in our statement in the Security Council on 16 October 1996 , we strongly support an immediate and lasting ceasefire based upon the demilitarization of Kabul , the creation of a neutral police force in the capital and the establishment of a transitional Government of national unity encompassing all major Afghan sides .  
This affirmative vote will , however , reflect more our firm and overriding attachment to the overall process of codification and progressive development of international law , rather than a strong conviction that the text of the draft Convention now before us is a fully satisfactory and balanced one which could not have been improved in some of its major aspects .  
The Committee took note with appreciation of the efforts of ACC to promote a coordinated and integrated system-wide approach to the follow-up to major international conferences through ad hoc inter-agency task forces , and requested that the results of the comprehensive assessment of the work of the task forces to be carried out by ACC in 1997 should be included in the next annual overview report of ACC .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .

In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
Similar expectations also exist for the quality and quantity of information and contributions made by the major groups themselves : in the next phase , their inputs will need to be more accurate , unique and reliable , while their organizational structures will need to be increasingly transparent and accountable .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .

He emphasized the fact that , owing to the deleterious effects of transborder crime , international cooperation against it had become the fourth major area after political , economic and military cooperation .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
It is paradoxical that UNEP , an organization that has over the last 20 years played a major role in the development of systems designed to monitor the global environment , has no discernible internal system for monitoring the substantive progress of and results produced by its projects or programmes .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
Its development , however , should not delay action , and it may not be needed in countries where major direct or indirect causes have been identified , well understood and documented , or where deforestation is not viewed as a problem at the national level .  
Altogether , the new directions report contains 20 major recommendations that touch on other issues such as the formulation of national TCDC policies , the strengthening of national TCDC focal points , the reorientation of capacity and needs matching exercises , the promotion of " triangular cooperation " , the establishment of improved linkages with the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and the identification of new funding arrangements for TCDC , including the formulation of subject-specific TCDC " products " that could attract special funding on the basis of their intrinsic importance .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
At the coordination segment of the Council of 1995 , devoted to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations system and implementation of the results of the major international conferences organized by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , the Council decided that it would ensure the harmonization and coordination of the agendas and work programmes of the functional commissions by promoting a clearer division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them ( thirteenth paragraph of agreed conclusions 1995 / 1 ) .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,

In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
The purpose of turning their bimonthly meetings into a political / technical seminar , with the participation of the Commission 's and Iraq 's scientific and technical experts , has been to narrow the major outstanding issues to a manageable quantity .  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
At the country level , the General Assembly acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
In paragraphs 39 and 40 of its resolution 50 / 120 , the General Assembly reiterated the resident coordinator 's level of responsibility and authority , making him / her responsible for facilitating the coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the country level , and requesting that the resident coordinator be informed of planned programme activities of the United Nations system organizations at an early stage of formulation .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The Committee took note with appreciation of the efforts of ACC to promote a coordinated and integrated system-wide approach to the follow-up to major international conferences through ad hoc inter-agency task forces , and requested that the results of the comprehensive assessment of the work of the task forces to be carried out by ACC in 1997 should be included in the next annual overview report of ACC .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
While there is not yet a universally accepted definition of terrorism _ academics and experts tending to approach the phenomenon from varying perspectives , and Governments tending to label as acts of terrorism manifestations of the phenomenon which directly affect their own interests while remaining unconcerned about the emergencies of others _ admittedly , one of the major difficulties standing in the way of consensus has been the continuing controversy about wars of national liberation and the motives advanced to justify violence .  
Taken together , these developments have posed major dilemmas regarding the professional behaviour and values of the public service : How can such traditional administrative values as accountability , fairness and integrity be reconciled with new citizenship values - transparency , responsiveness and responsibility - and with such managerial values as performance , efficiency , and results ?  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
The high technical and professional standard of Cubas scientific work force , allied to the major achievements in the development of the chemical-pharmaceutical , biotechnological and medical equipment industries , is leading Cuba to concentrate its efforts and resources on programmes that generate export earnings , for which purpose we are working hard to find markets in which to expand our exports to the maximum .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Data from these surveys will serve a new major initiative , namely to establish a national strategy for increasing social productivity and reducing regional disparities ; this work supported by UNDP will be based on defining and mapping poverty , and on establishing a national poverty line or band . 
Recognizing also that coordinated follow _ up implies that the major conferences should be viewed as interlinked and contributing to an integrated framework of and a global partnership for development ; in this context , major cross _ cutting themes established in the world conferences need to be identified and built upon ,  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
By resolution 1997 / 61 of 25 July 1997 , at its substantive session in 1997 , the Council stressed the need to further promote integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major international conferences in the social , economic and related fields , and decided to include the question in the agenda of its substantive session on an annual basis .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
Similarly , the international community 's assertions of true partnership with Africa in the face of failing official development assistance and impossible debt repayments to mention just two major constraints may soon sound hollow unless that partnership manifests itself in concrete programmes of action .  
These changes of a political , economic and social nature have been greatly inspired and conditioned , if not caused , by major global transformations as we approach the end of the century , and reflect the acknowledgement by African Governments of the aspiration of their peoples to greater freedom and democracy and respect for their basic rights within the context of a multiplicity of ideas and equality of opportunity .  
The themes of the Colloquium will be : an overview of the international law-making process and the role of the International Law Commission ; major complexities encountered in contemporary international law-making ; selection of topics for codification and progressive development by the Commission and its working methods ; the Commissions work and the shaping of international law ; enhancing the Commissions relationship with other law-making bodies and relevant academic and professional institutions ; and making international law more relevant and readily available .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
This was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the major countries of Europe and North America , in the current difficult situation , have shown the political will to accommodate mutual interests and find compromise solutions designed to keep the world from returning to confrontation .  We continue consistently to oppose the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance as an outdated and , hence , counter-productive policy direction .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .  
At previous international conferences , Governments agreed upon a set of goals and objectives for national and international efforts in the areas of education , literacy and health , in particular maternal and child health , and the control of major communicable diseases .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  
Closely related to the follow-up to and implementation of the Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation of and follow up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels to the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
Inasmuch as Europe Eastern and Western has been the main partner with Egypt in trade transactions , tourist flows and cultural interactions , so has Egypt been and will continue to be a major active party in ensuring stability and regulating a veritable interaction between the European dimension of Mediterranean security and the Mediterranean dimension of European security , in the full meaning of the comprehensive concept of contemporary security . 
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
In the sphere of collective security and the maintenance of world peace , although major catastrophes have been averted , the United Nations has not succeeded in making real the dream of every human being to live in peace in a world free from the pestilence of war and all the attendant horrors of human carnage and the senseless destruction of everything we hold dear .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
We are aware that the issue of social development can not be separated from the major transformations taking place today at the political , economic and cultural levels and that , therefore , any answers must be based on a realistic view of the social situation and the economic circumstances of development .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
The heads of State , Government and delegation stressed that , by deciding not to call into question the principle of official development aid , the summit meeting of the group of the seven major industrialized countries in Lyons renewed the vision of the relationship among development partners based on common interest .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
This youth policy is coordinated on an inter-ministerial basis and involves two major non-governmental organizations : the National Union of Syrian Students ( with a membership composed of students in universities , postgraduate studies and higher and intermediate institutes ) and the Revolutionary Youth Union ( with a membership of over 1.5-million composed of young workers , rural youth , students with both political and non-political backgrounds , including social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic and artistic . 
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
There is an increased willingness to work across national borders marked by mountain chains , in particular for scientific reasons , such as to study the behaviour of migratory species , for environmental conservation purposes , and for ecological / economic reasons among countries sharing major watercourses .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
The major activities included the completion of a full environmental test campaign ( thermal vacuum , vibration , RF , and mass properties measurements ) on the Canadian MSAT M1 satellite ( successfully launched on 20 April 1996 ) , and the initiation of environmental testing on the various components ( motor modules , joints , latching end effectors , and the mobile base system ) for Canada 's contribution to the international Space Station Project , the Mobile Servicing System .  
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution , including further recommendations for enhancing the dialogue and an assessment of the ongoing efforts for its strengthening , such as the outcome of the discussions in the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group , possible future themes for dialogue , and proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
According to reports received in January 1997 , besides the practice of summoning suspected political opponents to the security headquarters every day early in the morning and releasing them late in the evening , night _ time summoning to the security headquarters became a constant feature in Khartoum and other major northern Sudanese towns during the second half of 1996 .  33 .  On 15 August 1996 , 65 civilians and active and retired officers were arrested in Port Sudan .  
Its cultural and linguistic ties with both the United States and Europe , its geographical proximity to the United States mainland and its weak institutional structures contribute to the continued use of the Caribbean subregion as a major transit point in international drug trafficking .  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
The present report limits itself to a selection of human activities that are : ( a ) not gravely hazardous to the environment if carried out over a limited period of time but are cumulative and hazardous if undertaken on a continued basis ; ( b ) undertaken occasionally and / or involve a potential risk of major contamination within a given geographical area and time-frame .  4 .  The report , however , does not provide a comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts of activities that are gravely hazardous to the environment .  
In this connection , the frequent undue delays experienced in court cases involving rape and sexual offences pose a major problem , so that at any given time 200 to 250 cases are pending before G Court , whereas a backlog of 80 cases is normally considered acceptable .

With the decline in the external resource inflows to Africa and with little or no prospects for any major improvements in accessing external savings , particularly in the form of official development assistance ( ODA ) , African Governments are now fully aware that effective mobilization of both domestic and external resources is crucial for long-term sustained development .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .

Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .

This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .

Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .

All major gynaecological centres in the country report an increase in the number of pregnant women suffering from threatened abortion , premature deliveries , slow foetal growth , higher Caesarean section incidence , etc .  
Non-recurrent publications on : studies on transport efficiency ( 2 ) ; global framework for electronic commerce and development ; legal guidelines on electronic commerce for trade points ( 2 ) ; regional and international institutional framework for trade points ; major developments in international trade law ; studies on human resources development issues in trade-supporting services ( 2 ) ; trade facilitation handbook ;  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to promote an informed and positive public understanding of the activities of the United Nations and help build broad-based global support for the Organizations goals by highlighting the priority issues of concern to the international community .  
One means of accomplishing this will be to disseminate , at the pace dictated by media deadlines , more live footage and quickly edited raw materials for television and radio in particular , including , where possible , audio-visual coverage of United Nations activities in major international developments in which the Organization is a principal player .  
Armed conflict in southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
The Sub-Commission 's working methods in respect of its research and study projects should , consistent with the independent expert character of the body , entail a well-prepared , thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question , any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission . 
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
Following current practice in cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
In paragraph 10 of its report ( A / 52 / 410 ) , the Advisory Committee stated that it had been informed that annex B , section 6 , Loss or damage , paragraph 18 , of the contribution agreement would read as follows : In cases of loss or damage resulting from a single hostile action or forced abandonment , the United Nations will assume liability for each and every item of major equipment when the collective generic fair market value equals or exceeds the threshold value of $ 250,000 .  
International cooperation in building major facilities is most effective when the project draws on the complementary capabilities of different nations , or when the project would be too expensive for individual nations to afford or if the international cooperative initiative itself represents a major challenge for human beings to achieve a particular goal .  
Annual meetings during which all the major problems of society are discussed , with very structured progressive legal proposals ( many of which served as the basis for national legislative systems ) : the right of women to equality in all fields , not out of a rather empty feminism but out of simple respect for human rights . 
The combination of a major issue , such as biotechnology , and a minor theme , such as agriculture , had proved an effective way of approaching a single field of activity from multiple and complimentary perspectives , and the Commission might like to take a similar approach to the development of a work programme for the next inter-sessional period .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
International and regional conferences and meetings , in particular the twelfth World AIDS Conference , held in Geneva in June 1998 , provided an effective forum for drawing global attention to the major gaps in action on the epidemic and to the very significant role that young people can play in shaping the global response .  
Besides socio-economic impediments , conflicts , which have erupted or continued to linger in several parts of the world , have impoverished countries in a number of major regions , in many cases wiping out the achievements of decades of economic and social development and environmental protection , and compromising the possibility of reaching the goals set by United Nations major conferences .  
The analysis conducted by the General Assembly for the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in 1998 confirmed that resident coordinators have an important role to play in assisting Governments in their responsibilities for the integrated implementation of the major international conferences .  
Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
The Economic and Social Council , pursuant to decision 1998 / 290 of 31 July 1998 , taken at its substantive session of 1998 , held a two-day informal meeting on basic indicators for the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major United Nations conferences .  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
The major policy recommendations in the area of social development include enhanced budgetary allocations for social services , establishment of a formal social fund , targeting of measures related to employment creation , cash transfers , free or subsidized provision of essential goods and services and credit facilities in the short term , introduction of an effective system of unemployment insurance , and revision of development strategies to minimize vulnerability to crises in the future .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
In addition to the human costs of the conflict , evidenced notably by numerous civilian casualties , the destruction of major industries by the air bombardment , as well as damage caused to infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity supply , health services , education , communications , heating , the damage to land and river transportation links and the loss of trade , have caused tremendous economic and social hardship for the civilian populations . 
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
A major success of the Decade has been a widespread acceptance of the fact that the growing risk of disasters associated with natural hazards , frequently compounded by uncontrolled or adverse human practices , must be mitigated .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Serving as the departmental focal point for developing and coordinating the implementation of global public information strategies and activities to promote special conferences , United Nations decades , international years and other major events relating to the major thematic areas ;  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .  Over 45 NGOs , along with major bilateral donors , have committed personnel and resources to meet the immediate relief needs of the people of Kosovo .  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
The view was expressed that African countries in particular had been marginalized in that field , which was an unfortunate situation , considering that the continent was faced with major social and economic problems , some of which could be solved by the application of space technology . 
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
Recognizing the importance of space science and space applications for the fundamental knowledge of the universe , education , health , environmental monitoring , management of natural resources , disaster management , meteorological forecasting and climate modelling , satellite navigation and communications , and the major contribution that space science and technology make to the well-being of humanity and specifically to economic , social and cultural development ,  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
In the post _ cold _ war world which emerged at the beginning of the present decade , the initial phase of optimism , cooperation and the adoption of major decisions in the field of world strategic policy has gradually been replaced by another in which narrow individual and often intransigent considerations on the part of the various international actors tend to prevail .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
In 1998 , intensive training was conducted for over 60 local counterpart teams in the operation and maintenance of existing water systems in the southern sector , and 45 major feeding centres and main distribution points received adequate supplies of clean water . 
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
Misalignments of exchange rates and trade imbalances owing to domestic economic policies that were introduced without concern for their impact on the global economy are generally acknowledged to be a major source of protectionist pressures which manifest themselves both in unilateral national measures and in tensions threatening the rules of the multilateral trade regime .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
I support the proposal put forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a global pact on common values and principles be concluded within the framework of a public / private partnership , between the United Nations and major companies , in order to lend the law of the market a human face .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
The Seminar offered presentations by representatives of the academic and non-governmental communities and the private sector on international policy issues and trends and on selected project experience from Africa and Latin America , which included activities supported by the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability . 41 .  A major cross-cutting theme considered at the Seminar was gender-sensitive and disability-responsive policy design and evaluation .  
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
On the other hand , commitments undertaken under IMF / World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes have reinforced and widened WTO commitments and accelerated the adoption of non-reciprocal autonomous liberalization measures , and bilateral agreements with major developed countries have further reduced the remaining policy options and WTO flexibility . 
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
Anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant market positions limit market access and market entry to major developed country markets ; they include exclusive dealing , market sharing , export restraints imposed on licensees and joint venture partners , and denial of access to international networks and technology markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
In the area of international trade , he expressed his delegations concern at the fate of major export commodities , such as sugar , after the Lom Convention expired in the coming months and urged WTO to establish specific criteria for the special and preferential treatment of developing countries .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Without an increase in development assistance funding , it would be impossible to meet all the current major challenges ranging from international debt , education and health to access to knowledge for the promotion of economic and social development .  
A number of challenges lay ahead , including the achievement of a serious reduction in excess mortality and morbidity among the poor , which would require Governments to reallocate resources to activities that had proved to be effective and to focus on major diseases , such as malaria , HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis , and on the most vulnerable populations , particularly women .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Calls for the speedy and effective implementation of the Beijing Platform of Action2 and the relevant provisions contained in the outcomes of all other major United Nations conferences and summits and , in this regard , expresses the hope that the special session of the General Assembly on questions and issues related to women scheduled for the year 2000 can take tangible and significant steps to enhance the effective participation of women in development ;  
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Following a brief introduction of the subject by the Chairman-Rapporteur and the independent expert , Ms . Anne-Marie Lizin , the first meeting of the workshop was devoted to a general discussion focusing on three major topics : sociological and political aspects , causes , types and situations of poverty ; the title of a possible draft declaration ; and the main orientations of a possible declaration .  
Several developed countries , too , have operated domestic &amp; lt ; set aside = programmes to reduce productive capacity for particular farm products in market surplus ; while in cases of chronic overcapacity , developed country Governments , have on occasion , encouraged the major firms involved to reach informal arrangements to reduce capacity .  
A practical programme of supply management to reduce excess supply , and to bring a better medium-term balance into the market , would need to be based on detailed assessments of trends in world demand for , and supply of , each of the major commodities experiencing persistently of depressed prices , the related trends in world stocks , and the expected future price trends , so as to determine the need for supply management in particular cases .  
Its governing General Council allows representatives of all major countries ( with the notable exception of China and Russia ) to participate in relative equality ( at least formally ) , and the WTO ministerial conferences have been accompanied by extensive public debate .  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through , inter alia , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming , and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
The European Union attached great importance to the commitments made by all countries and major groups to the implementation of the principles of the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 ; it believed that the enhancement of public awareness was essential and engaged in continuous dialogue with civil society on environmental matters .  
Given that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with fortuitous events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of oil producers and consumers alike .  
Conscious that oil is the mainstay of the national economy in the GCC States and the major source of energy in the world as a whole , the Council decided to proceed with the formulation of a unified stance with regard to oil-market conditions that will ensure a balance between supply and demand and will be able to cope with unanticipated events that upset the market and have an adverse impact on the interests of producers and consumers alike .  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this question by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries and , in this regard , stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries , and in this regard stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Each of the two competing and opposing systemic families was faced with a specific , endogenous and major adaptation crisis , with both crises interacting at the international level .  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;

As a logical consequence of the chronically unstable situation in certain parts of the continent and the constantly growing number of refugees generated by its convulsive conflicts , dealing with the humanitarian situation in Africa today is a major challenge to Africans and to the whole international community .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .
