President Paqieco pointed out in his speech after signing the bill that the " National Competitiveness commission " was formed by people in charge of economic , foreign trade , agriculture , tourism , transportation and other public or private sectors .  The commission set down strategy , plan and implementation programs , which involves 5 aspects as infrastructure , engergy , telecommunication , social security and capital flow .  
Xinhua News Agency , Shenzhen , September 12 ( Reporter : He Guanghuai ) - Shenzhen will adopt the franchise method to attract more capital from the society and overseas to participate in the development and operation of public service industries .  This will include sewage water treatment , living garbage treatment , environment / sanitary service and medical garbage processing etc .  The objective is to accelerate the migration of municipal and public service industries to a market economy model .  The process can also improve the development level of Shenzhen as an international city .  
UNCTAD indicated that the excessive dependence on foreign capital , rapidly rising foreign debts , the low and unstable prices of primary products , the continuous spread of HIV / AIDS , and unceasing civil wars are all important factors that hinder the continuous economic improvements of the least developed nations .  
As the economic and cultural center for China 's north east region , the provincial capital Shen Yang and five surrounding cities have jointly formed a metropolis , with Da Lian gradually becoming a significant port in north east Asia .  
Speaking by regions , the economically more developed northern regions including Lombardy accounted for 45.1 percent of the national population , middle regions including the Lazio region , where the capital Rome is located , took up 19.2 percent , and southern regions including Sicily , where the economy is relatively underdeveloped , accounted for 35.7 percent .  
Following the establishment of the customs office in Chongming , organizations inside Chongming county can handle all customs procedures without stepping off of the island .  This will play a positive role in further improving the investment environment in Chongming , in accelerating the attraction of foreign capital , in handling customs procedures conveniently and speedily , in building Chongming into a highly open , large-scale trading port geared to the international market , and in triggering the development of an economy geared to the international market , with export processing , shipping transfers , etc .  
In 1995 , the National Development Bank successfully organized 50-million US dollars in loans from foreign syndicates for the first time , and at the same time , undertook the transfer of foreign export credit for the projects such as the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Project and the second phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power , etc .  From the aspect of both national capital and foreign capital , it continually increases support for key construction projects and has played an active role in promoting China 's economic development .  
At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .  
During this period , this province recently approved a total of nearly 200 foreign business investment projects , almost doubling over the same period last year .  The contracted foreign capital utilized was 578-million US dollars ; signed contracts for foreign projects and the export of labor services were 347-million US dollars ; at the same time , nine foreign capital financial institutions such as the Overseas Chinese Bank of Singapore and the National Guard Life Insurance Company of Australia , etc . , have successively settled in Sichuan .  
This year , Sichuan can take new steps in opening up to the outside world .  Its main experience is that the provincial government encourages the expansion of foreign trade export and adopts a series of preferential support policies to attract foreign capital , such as " preferential policies in Sichuan Province for encouraging foreign investment " , etc . that the province promulgated and implemented , providing foreign merchants with a preferential and lenient policy environment .  
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that , since 1994 the number of " three-capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500 , and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700-million US dollars , which represented threefold and sevenfold increases , respectively , over the years before 1993 .  
Kershye , chairman of the Foreign Capital Financial Organization stationed in Beijing and chief representative of the Belgian General Bank 's Beijing Representative Office , expressed at the conference that the foreign capital financial institutions stationed in Beijing intend make contributions to Henan Province 's economic construction and the development of China 's middle and western regions .  
Faced with an upsurge of additional investment by foreign businesses of various countries the Shanghai government expressed that they will work more diligently to perfect the investment environment , provide more standard operation space for foreign businesses , and strive to reach the aim of 1 / 4 of the total amount of the foreign capital coming from the foreign business added investment by the end of this century .  
According to presentations , because foreign funded enterprises increased equipment imports as investments , and additionally , China , for the first time opened its foreign trade area to foreign capital in Pudong and established three joint venture trade companies , with imports and exports of foreign funded enterprises in Pudong this year increasing 37.4% compared with the same period last year , and reaching 3.86-billion US dollars while accounting for 45% of Pudong 's total imports and exports .  
Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
The company has utilized and completely made liquid social assets of more than 10-billion yuan by employing forms such as mergers , acquisitions , etc . ; integrating its key development projects to attract overseas capital , FAW has successively established eighteen joint ventures with eight countries and regions .  
Employees in foreign invested enterprises are dispersed across industries , the real estate public service industry , the commerce and catering service industries , the construction industry , the farming , forestry , animal husbandry , side-line production and fishery industries , and the traffic , transport , and postal industries .  In recent years , some Chinese employees have gone to work in some sporadically appearing foreign capital financial institutions .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the US securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the US economy , and that the New York Stock Exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
Wuhan , in Hubei province , located in the center of China 's interior , will , in the future , put emphasis on utilizing foreign capital in the areas of the high-tech industry , basic industries , infrastructure construction , agricultural development , etc .  
Last year , although there was a drop in the quantity and the contract amount of recently approved projects utilizing foreign capital in Shandong Province , foreign capital actually utilized maintained growth , reaching over 4.2-billion US dollars , and increasing more than 17% compared with the previous year .  Of this amount , foreign merchants ' investment actually realized was over 3-billion US dollars , increasing 9% compared with the same period the previous year .  
In infrastructure , a number of expressway projects have been formally signed with the outside , and a number of municipal public infrastructure merchant-invitation projects have also been announced overseas , signifying the complete start of utilizing foreign capital in the areas of Shandong 's infrastructure .  
Xiaoling Wu also revealed that up to now , China 's domestic institutions have cumulatively issued US dollar equivalent foreign currency debts of about 17-billion US dollars on the international capital market , forcefully supporting the rapid , continuous and healthy development of the country 's economy .  
In order to meet the needs of investors , the " Shenye Holding Company " ' s market broker fully exercised distribution rights of excessive shares , with the corporate raised capital increasing from the original 400-million HK dollars to 532-million HK dollars .  The launching of the 650-million " H shares " of Shenzhen Expressway Stock Company , Ltd , right afterward was recently a great success , with raised capital surpassing 400-million HK dollars .  
According to information from the Provincial External Economy and Trade Committee , in 1996 , Shandong 's foreign-capital corporations ' exports achieved 5.49-billion US dollars , occupying 51% of total provincial export values ; the entire province 's actual utilized foreign capital occupies 14.7% of the whole society 's fixed asset investment ; foreign merchant investment corporation employees have reached 1.15-million people , occupying 10.9% of total industrial employees in the entire province .  
The entire province has actually utilized foreign funds of nearly 1-billion US dollars , and has established a large number of extroverted agricultural " three capital " enterprises which combine agriculture , industry , trade and technology and integrate manufacturing , supply and marketing , and through foreign merchants sales channels , it has also expanded its export of agricultural products .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
According to what was revealed in the meeting , as far as investment direction is concerned , Tianjin encourages Taiwanese investors to invest in infrastructure , base industries , funded technology concentrated industries , and high-technology projects , and to participate in the technological reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , to invest in third industry experimental projects .  Taiwanese financial capital and industrial capital institutions are welcome to come to Tianjin to build up financial organizations .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
The utilization of foreign capital has made up the deficiency of funds needed for construction projects at home .  It has increased the state 's revenues and gains on foreign exchange , promoted the adjustment of economic structure , optimized industrial structure , accelerated integration of China 's economy with the world 's economy , and created a large amount of employment opportunities.In addition , products manufactured by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched people 's material life .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
In 1999 , the " separation between revenue and expenditure " practice in public security , procuratorial , court , and industry and commerce departments had been extended down to the county level , while it was in practice in other fee and fine collecting departments at the central and provincial levels as well as at the provincial capital city level and the level of city whose mayor holds the same rank as vice provincial governor .  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
Wu Yi also expressed the hope that Hainan will adhere to the principle of being driven and boosted by the policy designed for it , by the application of science and technology , by introducing foreign equipment , technology , and capital , and by associating with domestic enterprises , in order to further build up the special economic zone . 
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
So , the " accession to the WTO " will not only be conducive to rejuvenating and benefiting the labor-intensive industries with strong international competitiveness but it will also be conducive to quickening the readjustment of the capital - and technology-intensive industries and enabling them to grow up at an early date .  Besides , the WTO entry will also be able to help normalize convoluted pricing signals and quicken the setup and improvement of the socialist market economic system .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
Capital flow will have a greater influence and impact on a country 's economy , particularly the great circulation and speculation of short-term capital .  Without sound market operating mechanism , rational interest mechanism , and strict regulatory system , it will be extremely easy for the domestic economy to be controlled by the international market if we abolish the restrictions on capital outflow and inflow too early .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
The conveyance of policy must be rapid , prompt , and accurate ; market interest rates and flexible foreign exchange rate mechanisms must be closely coordinated ; and opportunities for speculative profit-taking in capital and foreign exchange must be prevented through a sound monetary and foreign currency market .  
The critical decision made by the Party 's Central Committee received enthusiastic responses from all over China , particularly from the Western Regions . A considerable number of cadres and people have cherished this rare opportunity more than others by quickly starting up , making general plans , conducting feasibility studies , inviting business , attracting capital , implementing measures , and making the best use of every minute .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
Equity capital should primarily be raised from the domestic and international capital markets , and oriented toward the public , the corporate investors , and the special investment funds as well .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Under the present turbulent and unstable international situation , we should pay special attention to the diversified forms and channels of making use of foreign capital so that we can gain the initiative in absorbing foreign capital .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
and facilitating the internationalization of the market , allowing Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises to seek listings on the domestic stock exchanges while encouraging qualified domestic enterprises to raise funds through initial public offerings on the overseas stock exchanges , and also allowing foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in enterprises in some competitive industries in China so that China 's capital market will be fully opened to foreign investors step by step .  
Starting last year , we implemented drastic reforms in such overall areas of the enterprises as management models , mechanisms for motion , and management scope .  We greatly increased overall planning and policy , liquidation and investment , capital management , organized marketing , science and technology research and development for customer service and handling of public relations , and basically realized transformation from a State administered company to large size enterprise group .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
Compared with other countries , in 1999 China 's overall economic amount ranked seven in the world , major industrial and farm product output ranked first in the world , total foreign trade amount ranked ten in the world , foreign exchange reserve ranked second in the world , international tourism ranked eight in the world , and attraction of foreign capital ranked second in the world .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Third , we must make preparations ahead of time , guarding against and dispelling in a timely manner the risk of imbalances in our international balance of payments which may result from bringing in foreign capital improperly , and we should also enhance our oversight and advance warning regarding foreign capital flow , strengthening our statistical analysis of the international balance of payments .  
Accordingly , we should cultivate and develop domestic money markets by accelerating reform of the domestic investment and financing system , as well as creating a fair competition mechanism for domestic and foreign capital , making full use of the potential of the high domestic savings rate , being truly rational and effectively taking advantage of " two markets and two sources of funding " , thus avoiding over-dependence on outside sources of funding .  This is the main approach to guard against and dispel international balance of payment risks .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
At an assembly in the capital ardently welcoming back the Yugoslavian embassy personnel , Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech , calling for " the entire party and citizens of all nationalities across the country to turn the immense indignation toward NATO 's savage behavior and great patriotic passion into a powerful motivation to struggle together in one mind and heart for the ongoing strengthening of China 's economic might , national defense forces , and national solidification force " .  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
As disclosed by a source from the country 's Administration of Radio , Film , and Television who supervises cable television , the State Council will rush the approval of China 's administrative regulations on cable television through by the end of the year so that they may be handed over to the National People 's Congress for examination next year .  When the time comes , foreign capital involved in cable network investment in the country will be cleared up and play a supporting role in forming the " China Broadcast Television Network Cables Group . "  
Having witnessed improved economic life , people have started recognizing or supporting the SAR Government 's measures aimed at developing the economy , including measures for severely cracking down on illegal economic activities , for protecting intellectual property rights , for rectifying the market order , for building a much better international image for Macao , for raising the government work efficiency , for improving an internal investment environment , for inviting more outside investment or capital , and so on .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
The share of direct government investments among the total amount of investments society-wide will be reduced , while the share of independent , non-government investments , including individual , private , and foreign capital , will go up .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
The latest statistics show that China continues to be in front rank of the world in the amount of foreign capital used but , in light of the national condition that we have a vast territory but a dense population and there is a wide economic gap between regions , the use of foreign capital still needs to be expanded and its quality improved .  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
The scale of foreign trade and import of foreign capital has been continually expanded , a pattern of opening up on all sides , in broad spheres , and at multiple levels has basically taken shape , and the marketization of the national economy has been elevated to a noticeable extent .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
Despite widespread concern that a US economic slowdown will affect China 's foreign capital intake , a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation expressed optimism : This year China will maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also will cause a significant structural improvement .  
Ma Xiuhong pointed out that China 's foreign capital intake proved to continue the dramatic upward trend in the first quarter of the year .  She believed that this year China would maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also would cause a marked structural improvement .  
In recent years , our country is the developing country that attracted the largest amount of foreign funds , the stable economic growth and the continuing improvement of the investment environment in our country may enable our country to benefit from this round of international capital movement .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
When being told that most of the young workers came from rural areas , Hu Jintao praised them : You are hardworking and enthusiastic , have courage to make innovations , not only guaranteed the quality of construction but also lowered the costs of construction and raised the economic efficiency of the enterprises .  You have devoted your energy and sweat to the construction of the capital .  
In the last 10 years , China 's private enterprises ' average registered capital has increased from 93,000 yuan to 681,000 yuan , increasing by more than 6 folds , but each enterprise 's employment has been reduced from 18.1 persons to 13.4 persons , cutting back by as much as one-quarter .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
In sharp contrast to the slump in fixed asset investments is the continued and abnormal rise in registered capital and output value of the civilian-run economy , represented by the private economic sector .  
During the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , the annual rate of increase in the private economic sector 's registered capital hovered between 36.3 percent and 43.1 percent ; the annual rate of increase in total output value ranged between 21.6 percent to 49.2 percent .  Both displayed a pattern of rapid and steady growth , and behind the rapid increase in capital seemed to be a strong investment momentum .  
Exceptions are cases where the common reserve fund is being converted to increase the capital stock , undistributed profits are being used to pay stock dividends , or reverse stock splits are being executed to reduce the total number of shares outstanding in accordance with relevant regulations .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
By the end of May 2001 , the park had invested an accumulated total of over 8 billion yuan on the construction of its infrastructure , had used $ 4.2-billion of foreign capital , carried out construction on an area of 12 square km , completed the construction of high-level infrastructure , initially set up groups of advanced and high-tech industries with the electronics , information , precision machines , biological pharmaceutics and new materials industries as their core , and established a new management structure and operation mechanism .  
Any limited liability company in which the state owns shares ( including companies listed overseas ) making initial public offers or issuing additional shares must offer 10 percent state shares based on the total amount of capital raised .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
It is reported that Wang Jian , Wen Tiejun , Shi Xiaoming , and other scholars at the State Council think tanks and the China Research Society for Economic Restructuring recently analyzed the US Asia-Pacific strategy , as well as the motive behind a series of its provocative acts against China in the wake of the Sino-US aircraft collision incident , against the background of US capital crisis and from the international economic trends .  
In a recent speech at a forum in Zhejiang , entitled " New and High Technology , and Risk Investment , " the renowned economist Wu Jinglian said : With the evaporation of bubbles of the Nasdaq , which represents US high-tech shares , there has been an upsurge of Chinese students returning home from their high and new technology jobs in the United States . As Zhejiang has the features of rich private capital and flexible enterprise mechanisms , the wave of returned Chinese students from abroad will bring new opportunities to Zhejiang 's economic development .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .  China ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of assimilating foreign direct investment .  
The Asian financial crisis unexpectedly broke out in 1997 and brought serious impacts to our neighboring countries and regions .  The party Central Committee judged the hour and sized up the situation and timely worked out a series of measures to regulate the macro-economy , thus ensuring the steady development of our foreign export trade and foreign capital inflows despite the unfavorable international economic environment .  
Jia Qinglin said : Over 80 years , especially over more than 50 years since the founding of new China , under the leadership of the CPC , Beijing , as a time-honored ancient capital city well-known to the world , underwent earthshaking changes .  It changed from a capital of a declining feudal empire into a great capital of the socialist motherland , and is now marching toward a modern international metropolis .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
In meeting with delegates , CPC General Secretary and State Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed that adhering to carrying out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside , attracting more and better foreign capital and developing an open-style economy will be of major significance in furthering the continued rapid and healthy development of our national economy .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .  
As China 's accession to the WTO is approaching , the government has changed their views on civilian-run economic sectors , and civilian capital has also increased .  As a result , the authorities responsible for the media formally clarified their stand a month ago on foreign capital 's participation in media operations .  
Chief engineer Wen Faming of the provincial communications department helped an unqualified contractor with the family name of Zheng obtain a construction contract and accepted 660,000 yuan and HK $ 270,000 when he was head of the capital construction division and chief engineer of the provincial communications department and a responsible person of leading groups for competitive bidding and approvals in highway construction .  
The games we are going to host will be the Olympics Games of humanities , as ours is a country with ancient civilization and Beijing , the capital , has a brilliant history and culture of more than 3,000 years .  As the world is ablaze with different colors , the grand cultural exchange to be carried out through the Olympics Games will make the world even more colorful and splendid . "

adopt multiple forms , utilize foreign capital in an active , rational , and effective way , pay greater attention to importing advanced technology , modern management , and people with professional skills while absorbing foreign capital ;  
Since illegal capital outflow is a clandestine economic activity , it is not included in regular statistics .  Because of this , experts say that any attempt to gauge the scale of China 's illegal capital outflow can only give a rough estimate , rather than an accurate figure .  
A relevant expert with the State Development Planning Commission has expressed the following view : The fundamental solution to the problem of illegal capital outflow driven by the desire to seek the maximum profit is to allow the free outflow of capital .  
As a result , cross-strait tensions have continued ; popular morale has been shaken ; the investment environment has worsened ; there have been a constant outflow of capital and a continued plunge in the stock market ; the people 's wealth has shrunk ; unemployment has risen significantly ;  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
Despite China 's rather strict control over the media industry and the many obstacles foreign capital is bound to encounter in accession , covetous foreign financial groups , started from the periphery , have already sought ways to establish ties with the media inside China through various channel and gradually infiltrated into this fertile land of media industry .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
4 .  The Government should assess the feasibilities of establishing an offshore capital market .  According to international regulation , Taiwan should be prepared to establish an offshore capital market that operates independently from the domestic market .  Taiwan should attract overseas businesses , including the Taiwan businesses now operating on the Mainland , to become listed businesses or to issue securities in US dollar in this capital market .  
Generally speaking , fluctuations in the exchange rate for the RMB are primarily driven by the following factors : domestic economic growth trends , situation of China 's international balance of payments , changes in interest rates inside and outside of China , the degree of liberalization of capital markets and social stability .  
After China 's entry to the WTO , she will have to act according to the relevant regulations , and with the basic premise of protecting the stability of the renminbi , use a phased liberalization of Chinese domestic capital markets .  This is because the protection of the exchange rate 's fundamental stability is beneficial to the long-term stability of Chinese economic growth .  
Meanwhile , the city should also vigorously improve its investment environment , enhance both the quality and efficiency of its foreign fund utilization , and gradually meet the requirement of ensuring a simultaneous growth between its introduction of capital and its introduction of advanced technologies , modern management concepts , and people with professional skills .  
The state has clearly laid down : " Defining property rights follows the principle of ' the investor profits , ' " and " that portion of after-tax profits of enterprises owned by the whole people that are formed through the use of state capital and from funds inserted in the course of operations which is , with state permission , retained by the enterprises as increased investment , together with the surplus public funds and undistributed profits drawn from after-tax profits are defined as state assets . "  
As China has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of Renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
China 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
He said : Since foreign capital shall be barred from news channels and the issue of jointly producing programs with foreign investors for certain professional channels has been placed on the agenda for discussion , all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies and the local departments concerned shall be banned from holding discussions with foreign investors or conjecturing the central policies . 
Thanks to the originally sound economic foundation , better transport facilities , and more qualified personnel , it was more convenient for the eastern region to attract foreign capital and increase economic contacts with the countries and regions outside the country .  Obviously , focusing the development on the eastern region could reap greater and faster economic results , which was already proved by facts , as tremendous achievements in the economic development had been attained in the eastern region .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
Some relevant experts believe that after these mineral-exploration rights newly drafted by the Chinese Government are expanded and opened up , a large amount of foreign capital , technologies , and talented people will be attracted to take part in the risk exploration and development of mineral resources in Central and West China , which will play an active propelling role to the further exploration of the rich mineral resources in the whole country .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
According to their analysis , experts maintained : Factors , such as the accelerated economic recovery in the Asian region , steady domestic economic growth , and the acceleration of China 's entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] have played an important role in the recovery of foreign capital utilization .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Wu Jinglian also stated that although state-owned economy does not account for a high proportion of GDP now , it remains the main controller of scarce economic resources ; hence , on the basis of withdrawing state capital or reducing in varying degrees holdings of state shares and diversifying equity shares , it is necessary on the one hand to revamp China 's large and medium-sized enterprises into modern companies that match international practice ;  
However , financial globalization will also separate the flow of international capital more and more from the operation of physical economy , lead to disorderly large-scale capital flow , hold the risks of financial crisis , and make some economic entities partially lose their independent economic policymaking power and their ability to the macro economy .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
Last year , international investors were not enthusiastic in making investments in Asia because of the influence of the Asian financial crisis .  Total amount of foreign capital imported by China also dropped .  However , the EU 's actual investment in China still reached $ 4.47 billion , an increase of 4 percent over 1998 .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded . 
All levels of local people 's governments and relevant departments of the State Council have to formulate preferential policies in light of local conditions , such as reduction or exemption of fees for land sold , tax exemption on supplementary fees , and so on , so as to guide social capital , encourage and support social forces to run public welfare venues for teenage students ' activities .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
Software enterprises that are listed on the pioneering industry board and that give stock options to internal high-level managerial personnel and key technological personnel in the enterprises shall reveal this practice in detail in their prospectus for share flotation in raising capital .  They shall also provide the necessary explanatory materials to stock exchanges according to the demands of the regulations for listing on the pioneering industry board .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism . ( referred to as three forces hereunder for short ) .  They also decided to set up an antiterrorism organ in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstand capital .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
As a result of rising oil prices , industrial product prices bottomed out in the first half of the year , with ex-factory prices of industrial products rising two percent and prices of capital goods rising 4.3 percent .  This indicates that with domestic demand expanding , the rise in upstream product prices will cause consumer goods prices to rise , thereby further improving the situation of deflation that has existed for two years .  In addition , enterprise deposits rose substantially .  
The residents of Okinawa remember with pride that they were once citizens of the Ryukyu Kingdom , a kingdom that possessed a unique aquatic culture in East Asia . For several hundreds of years this kingdom had romantic personnel , economic , and cultural exchanges with China , Southeast Asia , and other countries .  Up to today , the Okinawan people still display their precious past to tourists in their capital and other museums , showing a broad sense of caring .  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .  
Additionally , the new " procedures " have standardized and systemized the measures the supervisory and management organs adopted to manage financial companies and have realized the unified supervision and management of the domestic and foreign capital , the domestic and foreign currencies , and the scheduled and unscheduled operations of financial companies .  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
First , it is necessary to step up law enforcement .  Second , it is necessary to cooperate with the State Economic and Trade Commission and other departments and implement the relevant policies and handle the technological and capital matters that will enable the large and medium state enterprises to fulfill the anti-pollution requirements .  Third , it is necessary to further strengthen basic work of fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements in industry , analyze the progress of work , find the focal and difficult points , and offer meticulous and classified guidance .  
The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
The downward trend of foreign capital inflow was checked in the first half of this year thanks to the upward trend of the international economy and the economic recovery of Asia .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .  
China has ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of foreign capital inflow .  It is not realistic to expect China to witness a high , sustainable growth in foreign capital inflow as it did in the middle of the 1990 ' s .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
As of the end of this year , China has successively approved the establishment of an accumulated total of more than 350,000 foreign-funded enterprises , with the relevant contracts involving foreign investment amounting to more than $ 630 billion ; and the foreign capital actually utilized over these years has exceeded $ 320 billion .  
The representatives of retired veteran cadres who are in Beijing , responsible persons of every relevant department of the army , heroic models of troops , militiamen in the capital , members of army-men families and revolutionary martyrs families , and representatives of former Kuomintang personnel who launched righteous revolts also attended the reception .  
and 4 ) allowing foreign-invested enterprises that come up to the required standards to be listed in China 's stock markets trading A-shares and B-shares , expanding the business ranges of the investment companies established by multinational corporations in China , simplifying the procedures for examination and approval , screening and adjusting pertinent policies that are detrimental to the absorption of foreign capital , and so on .  
Eliminating the regulatory tax on fixed-asset investments has provided a certain amount of relief for real estate-related business taxes , contract taxes , and land-value increment taxes , stimulating the ability of the real estate industry to drive economic growth and activating capital which was lying idle because of the large number of vacant buildings .  
Third , to facilitate the domestic economic and capital structural adjustment and enhance the international competitiveness of the national industries , it is also necessary to formulate new tax policies and adjust the existing ones under the precondition of flexibly applying the WTO rules and in light of the requirements of the state 's new industrial policies .  
In October the same year , the Bank of China promulgated the " Notice Concerning Risk Control by Commercial Banks While Handling International Settlement of Forward Letters of Credit . " It provides that " commercial banks , in handling their forward letters of credit business , must strictly follow state policies for foreign exchange control and the use of foreign capital , and they must have a genuine background of commodity trade . "  The notice also requires commercial banks to establish sound mechanisms for internal management and control .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .  It is essential to create a favorable external environment for developing countries , provide them with capital , technological , and manpower support , and help them eliminate the " digital gap , " so that all countries of the world can seek common development and prosperity in the process of economic globalization .  
Analysts estimate that , by 2010 , China 's domestic output value will double with respect to its current base , and this will require the increased and more skillful introduction of foreign capital , advanced technology , and management experience , as well as vigorous development of economic and trade relations and the continued opening up of domestic markets .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
It is necessary to step up efforts to make use of foreign capital and to actively introduce advanced technology , qualified personnel , and managerial expertise from abroad ; efforts should be made to accelerate the readjustment of the industrial structure , to upgrade the industry , to make technological innovations , to raise the quality and grade of products , and to make the products brand-name ones .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
It is expected : During the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " period , China will in total have attracted $ 230 billion of foreign capital , nearly 100 percent more than in the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " period .  For seven consecutive years since 1993 , China has been the champion among developing countries for attracting foreign capital .  
Responsible comrades of the propaganda departments , radio and television departments , the press and publications departments , and reporter associations in all provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities , and provincial capital cities and responsible comrades from provincial-level mass media units and reporter stations in provincial capital cities attended the conference in various local meeting grounds .  
Though the total amount of foreign capital utilized increased , the actual amount of foreign capital utilized dropped continuously due to last year 's drop in the contracted amount .  However , the contracted amount of foreign capital still reached $ 33.2 billion during the first eight months , up by more than 30 percent compared with the same period of last year .  
In 1999 , our country utilized almost $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in real terms , down by 12.8 percent from the previous year , despite maintaining a significant scale , which showed the first negative growth in the last few years , with the amount of contracted foreign capital also falling for the first time in the past many years . 
Given the demand of our national economic development and our commitments for WTO membership , our country is bound to open up more fields to the outside world , especially such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , foreign trade , commerce , tourism , and so on , step by step , and this is bound to create a favorable external environment for positively and effectively utilizing a growing amount of foreign capital . 
Over the past seven years , China is the developing country that attracts most foreign capital .  Constantly developing China is the indispensable and major part in the development of the economic globalization .  China 's joining the world trade organization will inject new vitality and dynamism into the economic globalization , expand new development space , is conducive to the joint development of China 's and world economical development , which will not only benefit China 's economy but also world 's economy .

Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .

Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .

To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .

Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .

The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .

There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .

At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .

Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .

Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , attained a further double-digit growth of 13.8% in real terms in the first quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , after a 13.0% increase in the fourth quarter of 2000 . 
Non-profit-making PISs are eligible for land grants at nominal premium and capital grants ( up to 100% of the cost of building a standard design primary or secondary public sector school of the same student population ) for the construction of school premises .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
The re-export volume of capital goods increased by 10.1% in April 2001 over a year earlier .  Notable increases in re-export volume were recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and transport equipment .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , slackened sharply to a meagre 0.4% growth in real terms in the second quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , from a strong leap of 11.5% in the first quarter .  
The GDP deflator , as a broad measure of overall price change in the economy , declined by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , much narrowed from the 1.7% decrease in the first quarter .  This was mainly attributable to a smaller decrease in the price deflator for gross domestic fixed capital formation and a renewed increase in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure in the second quarter .  
The Leisure and Cultural Services Department ( LCSD ) has drawn up an accelerated programme for the delivery of 64 capital works projects in the coming five years involving leisure and cultural facilities at a total estimated cost of $ 8.7 billion to meet community demands .  
* First , we must invest in human capital in a sustained manner and on a vast scale , sufficiently to form a deep , strong base of brainpower to support a knowledge economy with high value-added economic activities .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
The first and foremost is our open society , an independent judiciary , a transparent and efficient government , a level playing field , a business friendly environment , free flow of information and capital and all of which make us one of the best places of doing business . 
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , had a somewhat faster growth of 3.7% in real terms in the third quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , having eased back from an 11.5% surge in the first quarter to a 1.3% increase in the second quarter . 
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .  
In the capital and financial account , despite the austere economic environment worldwide , there was still a substantial injection of equity capital into the local economy in the fourth quarter , leading to a further net direct investment inflow .  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
" Hong Kong 's competitive advantages include an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , jurisdiction open to foreign lawyers and a free flow of capital and information , " he said .  
At a time when Asian economies are showing incipient signs of recovery against an improved external environment , international capital flows are triggering back to the region but in a more cautious and discriminate manner than before .  Investors are now a lot more selective about who may lend to and where they put their money .  
We will focus on the development of these niches .  Harnessing our sophisticated infrastructure , robust legal system and intellectual property protection framework , established international business experience and network , and a thriving capital market with high capital raising capability , we will continue to promote the industrialization of research findings and create an enabling environment for further technological advancement .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , plummeted by 16.5% in real terms in the first quarter of 2002 over a year earlier , after a 6.1% fall in the fourth quarter of 2001 . 
This was mainly attributable to an enlarged decline in the price deflator for exports of goods and a moderated rise in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure , which together more than offset a narrowed decrease in the price deflator for gross domestic fixed capital formation and a renewed rise in the price deflator for exports of services .  
He said : " Hong Kong offers numerous advantages for fund managers through a free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified fund management professionals , minimal government bureaucracy , state-of-the-art telecommunications and simple and low corporate tax . "  
China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
For our economy to remain vibrant and competitive , we must upgrade the calibre of our human capital and ensure the sustainability of our economic and social development by developing a comprehensive population policy and attracting more talents to Hong Kong , with due regard to the direction of our economic development , talent demand , land resources , migration figures ( including the number of arrivals from the Mainland ) , and the need to secure job opportunities for local workers .  
Miss Willis added that Hong Kong 's constitution , the Basic Law , protects the key ingredients essential to the territory 's ongoing development as an economy and a society .  These include the free flow of capital and goods , a freely convertible currency , our retained status as a separate Customs and Immigration territory , and the right to maintain its own shipping register and to negotiate its own air services agreements .  
China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
Ms Leung said that with its sophisticated telecommunications network , favourable geographical location , sound financial system , free capital flow and transparent investment environment , Hong Kong has developed into a major international financial centre and made many achievements .  
This was mainly attributable to an accelerated drop in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure and for gross domestic fixed capital formation , as well as a renewed fall in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure .  
" Much of our future success , like our past success , will depend on Hong Kong 's unchanging fundamentals : free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on the rule of law , clean and efficient government , and a simple and low tax regime .  Add to this , no exchange controls , transparent regulation and state-of-the-art telecommunications , " Mr Ma said .  
Within the GDP deflator , the domestic demand deflator had an enlarged year-on-year decline of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2002 .  This was attributable to a larger fall in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure , for gross domestic fixed capital formation , and for government consumption expenditure .  
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
Mr Ma said , " To keep Hong Kong 's capital market moving forward , we have to make sure that our regulatory standards are always on a par with international standards .  By upgrading the quality of our market , Hong Kong 's listed companies would be more attractive to international investors and their market capitalization is set to grow .  This will be conducive to attracting more quality mainland private and state enterprises to get a listing in Hong Kong . "  
Mr Ho added that if the directors or management of a company committed acts such as fraud or illegal transfer of assets or capital from the insolvent company to another company , this would have adverse impact on the subrogation income of the PWIF , as only a small proportion of the payment advanced to the employees could be recovered from the remaining assets of the employer .  
While many larger foreign enterprises have advantages in capital , human and technical resources , professional knowledge , experience in project management and implementation , and international connection , Hong Kong enterprises also enjoy unique strengths in developing the telecommunications and IT markets in the Mainland . 
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
We will step up efforts to promote the economic potential of Hong Kong and the PRD . We will actively open up new markets , bringing in more foreign capital , attracting foreign talent , and encouraging more multinational corporations to set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong .  
He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government had been pursuing vigorous infrastructural and administrative initiatives to promote freer flow of goods , people , capital and information and to leverage Hong Kong 's economic integration with the region .  These included 24-hour boundary crossings , streamlined visit procedures , and plans for the construction of a bridge linking Hong Kong to Macau to the western part of the PRD .  
It has a world-class financial and banking system with a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , a simple and low tax regime , an independent judiciary based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , as well as free flow of capital and information . "  
After making reference to overseas experience , seeking advice from the local plumbing trade and conducting trials with successful results , the Administration decided in 2000 that dual flush devices are suitable for use in Hong Kong although such devices may have a higher capital and maintenance costs .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
In regard to capital expenditure , we need to set aside about $ 0.3 billion for the installation of particulate reduction devices on pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles , and for the provision of a one-off grant to encourage early replacement of diesel public light buses with liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) or electric ones to further improve roadside air quality .  
He urged corporations in both the public and private sectors to actively consider issuing bonds as a means for raising capital in light of the current market environment of record low bank deposit rates and uncertain equity market .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The Companies Ordinance should be amended to require unlisted public companies or private companies , if directed to do so by holders of not less than 5% of all the nominal issued share capital of the company , to disclose full details of all elements of individual director 's remuneration package .  
I am confident because Hong Kong continues to enjoy many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
" With excellent business infrastructure , a highly qualified workforce , free flow of goods , capital and information and a transparent regulatory system , Hong Kong is an ideal location for retailers to establish their regional operations .  
Addressing some 100 guests at a reception hosted by the Swiss Chinese Chamber of Commerce , Mr Ma outlined Hong Kong 's fundamental strengths and efforts in maintaining its status as an international financial centre and the premier capital formation centre of the Mainland , the enhanced attractiveness to foreign investors following the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements , and the efforts and achievements in the financial services sector including the encouraging development of the Hong Kong bond market .  
Mr Ma noted that Hong Kong is the Mainland 's major international capital centre .  As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
" As an advance user of information systems , and having extensive experience in the development and deployment of computer applications , access to the latest technology , entrepreneurial spirit , and an active and sound capital market ; Hong Kong can play a key complementary role within the PRD Region to develop the information industry , riding on the abundance of competent IT professionals and potential market in the Mainland , " Mr Lai added . 
As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies , as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
In addition , Hong Kong has many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier . 
Additionally , Hong Kong has many comparative advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , goods and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Among Hong Kong 's key attributes are : the rule of law , backed by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for all businesses , whether local or foreign-owned ; the free flow of capital and a totally convertible currency ; freedom of information ; clean government ; and low taxes .  
This includes a level playing field and unrestricted movement of capital , together with a transparent regulatory structure , an independent legal system and a simple , low tax regime . "  
To make maximum use of the materials and lands has always been the ultimate goal in our economic reconstruction . It is essential , at this crucial hour , to develop a larger and better labor force and to enhance skills to meet the demands of working capital and of more intensive industrial needs .  
At that time the social order was stable the economy was thriving and the suburbs of Changan and Loyang were thickly populated . The capital , Changan , was the political , economic , and cultural center of Asia .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
With a viable stock market the average citizen can also participate in the development of the economy . Venture capital companies are a nascent industry in Taiwan and there are disagreements as to where to go and how fast to get there . There are regulations limiting venture capital to 15% of the total capitalization of any one company .  
Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Under the imperial examination system , the friends and relatives of a scholar traveling to the capital to take the final examination would customarily present him with a duck as a farewell gift , because the Chinese character for duck contains the phonetic chia , meaning number one or first place . Hospitable innkeepers in the capital would cook pigs ' feet ( t'i ) for the candidates as a sign that their names would be listed ( t'i ) on the roll of successful candidates .  
Funafuti , the largest island and the site of the capital , has only one road , which runs around the island . The road is paved with stone and lined with coconut and banana trees , whose broad , close leaves , brimming with a rich , tropical exuberance , obscure the view of the traditional grass huts behind .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
So when the stock prices fell , it was either time to tighten the belt or capital flows dried up altogether . For small and medium enterprises , in August stock certificates were redeemed at a rate of 4.6 per thousand . The balance sheet performance of most companies on the market was also not hopeful : from the reports of the first half of the year , of the 192 companies on the board , 33 reported losses outright .  
Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough . At the same time there is inflationary pressure in Taiwan , so that the government can not devalue the NT dollar to enhance export competitiveness , nor can it adopt a loose money supply policy to free up capital for enterprises .  
Especially after the end of the Second World War , which left the country , like the U . S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
The narrow streets are crowded with smoke-belching old cars discarded from the US . , the dilapidated wooden houses are gnawed by termites , and hurricanes are a source of constant trepidation ( after Belize City was devastated by one in 1961 , the government decided to build a new capital , Belmopan , in the center of the country ) .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
Yu Tzong-shian explains that a financial economy is characterized by high risk plus high profits . With rapid flows of information and capital it becomes essential to establish fair rules of the game , along with a tight regulatory regime for the finance sector .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
Many of the works on display are considered to be national treasures in the mainland ; indeed , they are recognized as consummate works of art by experts in the international community , as well . This exhibit offers the opportunity to learn not only about the cosmopolitan nature of the Tang dynasty and its capital , Chang'an , but also allows us to recognize the Tang as the most glorious of ages , in terms of art , culture , Buddhism , and military and economic strength .  
The impact of Chiung Yao and Young Pei-pei inspired one Taiwanese producer after another to follow in their footsteps . Demand for specialized film sites in the mainland rose sharply , and with capital raised from various parties , a host of film studios were established , directly managed by or aided by members of Taiwanese artistic circles , each specializing in a different genre and era .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
But there was nothing to smile about in this passage : " In 1241-1242 , Mongol cavalry led by Genghis Khan 's grandson Batu Khan captured Urgench , the capital of the Central Asian state of Khwarazm , massacred its inhabitants , broke its dykes , and wreaked great havoc . In 1241 , the Mongols burned and plundered Budapest and killed countless of its citizens , and in 1258 they also sacked the city of Baghdad in Mesopotamia . Hundreds of thousands were butchered , and magnificent buildings and countless art treasures were set ablaze . "  
" The old idea of saving money for retirement is no longer feasible . Currency can lose value and is really not dependable . Right now people should be spending all their effort at saving up human capital , raising their hireability , so that when a person goes out looking for a job he can actually get hired , " says Hsin Ping-lung . Hireability is based on two factors : good health and lifelong functional learning .  
Since Myanmar reformed its financial and banking system in recent years , 39 foreign bank representative offices and 17 local private banks have been set up in the capital

due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
BUCHAREST , January 24 ( Xinhua ) Romania has absorbed a total of 650-million dollars worth of foreign capital last year a sum equal to all of the foreign money flowing into the country in the previous four years  
Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
A suitable regulatory , legal and supervisory environment is a crucial element in effective private sector development , macroeconomic structural programmes , development of entrepreneurship and effective capital market development .  
Hence , investing in human capital , improving public administration and basic social services and creating an environment in which the private sector can play an essential role in the economic transformation are of paramount importance .  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Ever increasing dependence on information technology systems and their high level of sophistication , linked to the heavy capital investment required , have made information technology crucial to the effective functioning of UNDP .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) , despite its high capital cost , offers specific attractions for small islands because of their typical location close to deep oceans and warm surface water .  
A dozen countries in Asia and Latin America , characterized by financial analysts as " emerging markets " , received most of the capital inflow , while the vast majority of developing countries have not been touched by the growth in net financial transfers .  
While national efforts are the key to a successful export strategy , bilateral and multilateral support , including longterm capital , should make a major difference in reducing the period required to achieve the expected results . 
Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
After the provisional Government disintegrated , an interim Government was proclaimed on 8 April 1994 but left the capital on 12 April 1994 as fighting between the armed forces and the Rwandese Patriotic Front ( RPF ) intensified .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
The transfer of major financial resources to and from our markets causes great instability in capital flows in the world , leading to concern and uncertainty , and threatens the accumulated efforts of our peoples to establish a more just , more orderly and more stable economic system .  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
We are , however , alert to the dangers associated with that sector and , while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such institutions , we must be ever on guard for white-collar criminals who , as part of their everyday activity , launder their ill-gotten gains through the international financial systems , using both public - and private-sector capital projects for this purpose .  
We recognize the values and the capital that adults have left to us , and we are proud that they have forged a social existence which allows no room for intolerance based on racial , religious or cultural considerations .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
It also reaffirmed support for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their rights to return , to self-determination , and to establish their independent State on their national soil , with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital ; as well as support for the international programmes for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories .  
It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
None the less , some of the objectives of the Task Force are being addressed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics , which was established in 1992 with a membership of international and national statistical agencies to implement the recommendations contained in two IMF reports : " Report on the measurement of international capital flows " and " Report on the world current account discrepancy " .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Mindful of the need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
The economic returns resulting from those biotechnology applications that have been supported by venture capital have encouraged a steady increase in investment in biotechnology , yet the beneficial results of applications in developing countries and the benefits derived from such applications are not perceived to have extended much beyond the business community .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
In part this is because of the role of external forces ( e.g . , economic growth and interest rates in the OECD area ) in " diverting " funds from OECD economies to the emerging markets and also because other influences are of a transient or finite nature ( e.g . , resulting from privatizations and returning flight capital ) .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
At its twenty-fifth session , held in April 1994 , the Commission approved the present programme of work , paying special attention to the situation of the economies of the region , which have been characterized by expansion of economic activity with relative price stability , vast inflows of external capital and some relief from the debt burden .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
A prior requirement , however , would be the removal by individual countries of the range of impediments that currently limit intraregional capital flows , including foreign-exchange controls , legislation and regulations , that discriminate against foreign investors , restrictions on transfers and other direct and indirect measures designed to influence capital flows .  
This was the case for countries that had fixed exchange rates and whose economies were characterized by inordinate inflation and for still others that experienced volatile movements of exchange rates , which often changed much more than internal prices over time , as a result of capital flight and speculation as well as other effects of international capital markets .  
Measures to foster effective provision of infrastructure services by local government included ( a ) establishing a rational , transparent , legal foundation for local government with an appropriate degree of local discretion over issues of local interest ; ( b ) implementing a more appropriate assignment of revenues providing greater local autonomy over user charges and local taxes ; and ( c ) introducing more systematic and transparent criteria for allocating capital investment funding .  
Consequently , re-emphasis on social infrastructure , and on " social capital " 1 / is now seen as indispensable for avoiding the pervasive cycle of economic decline , increasing poverty and environmental degradation from which many countries are now struggling to escape .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
The establishment of open relations and transparent cooperation among the States in the region in all areas , such as economy , trade , transport , telecommunications , environmental protection and other areas of common interest for independent and versatile development of the States and of the region as a whole based on the openness of the region to all neighbouring regions in order to ensure unimpeded flow of people , goods and capital ;  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
The manufactured products which feature prominently in South-South trade of the dynamic East Asian countries include machinery and transport equipment ( ships and boats , electrical machinery , switchgears and parts ) , semi-manufactured products ( leather , knitted fabrics ) , resource-based manufactured products and a number of capital - and skill-intensive products ( office machines , automatic data processing equipment , television receivers , sound recorders , musical and optical equipment ) .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
NULLThe practices described in previous reports of arbitrarily rounding up children from the streets of the capital and major towns in northern Sudan and detaining them in special camps usually situated in remote areas continued to take place during the period under examination ( see E / CN . 4 / 1994 / 48 , paras . 89-94 , and E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 58 , paras .  NULL  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , i.e . of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , that is , of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
There is a heavy financial burden on the Government of Croatia to meet capital requirements in order to strengthen its infrastructure , as its current military-industrial complex is absorbing existing capital , thus preventing the investment necessary to achieve reconstruction and the restoration of infrastructure and other services .

of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
This commitment must be proven by the actual , unconditional implementation of all relevant agreements thus far concluded , to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights , including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State , with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
As a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital by the Taliban on 26 November 1995 , the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the escalation of fighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the efforts of the United Nations Special Mission , then headed by Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri , aimed at achieving an immediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the parties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of power , to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable to all Afghans .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
The process has therefore focused on completion of the internal free market for goods ; freeing the market for the movement of capital and investment and for the provision of services , including labour services , beginning with skilled labour ; and facilitating and encouraging factor movements through measures such as the harmonization and transferability of social security benefits and the avoidance of double taxation .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Improved access to private capital will be a key to success in providing EST opportunities for and improving the environmental performance of SMEs . Such companies have difficulties in remaining competitive in the rapidly expanding international marketplace .  
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
Additionally , urgent social and economic priorities and severe capital constraints lead to low policy priority for any specific and additional mitigation or adaptation measures .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
The Special Fund was established by the General Assembly to provide new administrative and operational machinery to spearhead the enlargement of the scope of United Nations technical assistance and , in particular , to " . . . facilitate new capital investments of all types - private and public , national and international - by creating conditions which would make such investments either feasible for more effective " ( General Assembly resolution 1219 ( XII ) on the financing of economic development , dated 14 December 1957 ) .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
Moreover , while the refusal to allow Argentine citizens to reside in the Malvinas Islands dated back more than a century , the current policy barring the immigration of Argentines reinforced the long-time and persistent policy of denying the entry of Argentine residents and capital , in contrast to the international trend towards regional integration and the free movement of persons , including in conflict areas .  
Instead of descending by the east coast of Florida , they crossed the Florida peninsula to Key West and from there moved south , then west all of this within the region under United States air traffic control and then follow a straight line to the capital of Cuba .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
In particular , minimum guarantee capital requirements are usually set on the basis of international standards and the " top end " of the market and often exceed considerably the value of premiums underwritten by a cooperative enterprise , given that these relate to the needs of members and , although critical to large numbers of persons , are modest in aggregate .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Reaffirming that investment in people is as vital as investment in capital , they called for paying special attention to sound basic education , skill formation and training , which is a lifelong undertaking , and improving the transition from school to work ;  
We in the OIC believe in speeding up the peace process and aim at putting it back on track with a view to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their right to return , their right to self-determination and their right to build their own independent State on their national soil with Al-Quds al - Sharif as its capital , as well as a complete and speedy Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and occupied Lebanese territories .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
Urgent transmissions were made by the Special Rapporteur in cases that evinced a fear of imminent extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; these cases included death threats and fear of imminent execution of death sentences in contravention of the limitations on capital punishment set forth in the pertinent international instruments .  
As I stated in my address to the General Assembly during the general debate on 7 October 1996 , the Taliban mercenaries used some type of chemical or internationally banned weapon against the forces of the Ministry of Defence of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on 25 and 26 September 1996 in Lata-band , Band-i-Ghazi and Pul-i-Charkhi , battlefield areas situated east of the capital , where the resistance against them was firm and tenacious .  
The situation facing UNRWA in the last quarter of 1996 was untenable because its cash reserves had been depleted , and replenishment could only be effected by immediate payment of pledges already received ; further future deficits could no longer be absorbed because the Agency 's working capital would have been exhausted by the end of 1996 ;  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
The Heads of State called for the all-round development of trade and economic cooperation among the Turkish-speaking countries , the expansion of economic ties at various levels , the promotion of economic integration processes , the elimination of obstacles to joint trade and the establishment of a favourable legal regime for individuals and legal entities engaging in economic cooperation in order to create a single market for goods , services , capital and labour , without prejudice to their international obligations .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
In this regard , I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian people can count on the support of Ukraine which , with its considerable scientific and technological potential , stands ready to develop dynamic Ukrainian-Palestinian cooperation in the economic sphere , in particular in the sectors of housing and capital construction , water supply , education and training . 
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .  The leaders of one opposition party alleged that the Government was involved , while the press quoted foreign officials who implicated the Presidential Security Unit .  
Yemen reaffirms the need to move quickly towards a final settlement of the question of Palestine that will allow the Palestinian people to attain their legitimate rights , especially their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital , in keeping with international law and with the fundamental principles established at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo and subsequent agreements .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
" At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development has evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . "

Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
As indicated in the proclamation of the Supreme Council for the Defence of Afghanistan and duly reflected in our statement in the Security Council on 16 October 1996 , we strongly support an immediate and lasting ceasefire based upon the demilitarization of Kabul , the creation of a neutral police force in the capital and the establishment of a transitional Government of national unity encompassing all major Afghan sides .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
The issues to be discussed at the conference are set out in table 4 , and include methods for estimating capital stock , including the perpetual inventory method and direct survey methods ; concepts of capital for different purposes , such as balance sheets and productivity analysis ; issues for national balance sheets ; and extensions of the 1993 SNA capital boundary , such as computer software , mineral exploration and non-weapon military equipment .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
The apparent dissolution of nation states in the economic sphere , the apparent absence of barriers to capital and its uncontrolled international mobility are beginning to produce multiple reactions that can be observed with increasing frequency throughout the world .  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
The world has witnessed fundamental economic changes , such as the end of State control of economic life in many States , the withering away of numerous restraints on international trade , the easy transfer of capital and huge investments across the world .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Replace the first sentence with the following : At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . 
The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
To this end , recognizing the need for the gradual formation and development of a common economic area through the creation of conditions for the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour , the Parties shall take effective measures to coordinate a strategy for carrying out economic reforms , deepening economic integration on the basis of mutual advantage and harmonizing their economic legislation .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
Some of the concerns included the fact that economic policies were increasingly affected by the sentiments of a globalized financial market ; that greater openness also implied greater vulnerability to shocks in the international economic system ; and that heightened international economic competition and greater capital mobility weakened the bargaining position of labour , exerted downward pressure on labour standards and compromised the capacity of Governments to implement countervailing social policies .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
When economic measures are employed for coercive purposes , instrumental economic effects are obviously their primary objective , which is achieved by restricting the target State 's access to markets , capital , technology and communications .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
If the benefits of the free movement of capital flows are to be retained , the problems of financial instability and negative socio-economic effects of financial turmoil need to be addressed at the national and international levels .  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
It lowered an average market interest rate for cooperatives based on capital investment , established the advisory and consultative councils with cooperative representation and advanced the autonomy of cooperatives .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
The problems of women in both urban and rural areas are such that women are not ready to become entrepreneurs because of insufficient start-up capital and managerial experience and an imperfect fiscal policy which does not suit everyone .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
The area , densely populated and containing the economic , social and cultural heart of the country , included the scenic capital Plymouth , located on the volcanos western flank .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
In its assessment of UNDP financial risks , the international consulting firm engaged by the Administrator advised that organizations such as UNDP , which do not have access to the capital markets nor the ability to borrow from banks to cover periodic cash flow needs , should maintain in liquidity the equivalent of 6 to 12 months ' expenditure as a prudent level .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
It is true that in certain outlying areas teachers salaries are below the minimum , because resources are insufficient to pay equal salaries throughout the country : this is one reason why there is a shortage of teaching staff , since they prefer to move to the capital in search of a better standard of living .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Such a mechanism should be written into the rules and conditions governing international financial contracts , in order to promote a better assessment of risks , eliminate irresponsible behaviour and reduce speculative short-term capital flows to emerging markets . 
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Contrary to the textbook model of large numbers of investors making careful independent judgements as to profitable opportunities , the capital markets are subject to bouts of herd behaviour that is , investors follow one another without forming their own judgements or expectations about individual economies .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
While the process of adapting from the television analog system to the digital standard has its financial implications in terms of capital investment in production equipment upgrade , the potential benefits for the effective dissemination of visual information are enormous .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
At the international level , a main objective of development assistance should be to support national efforts for sustained human capital formation .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .

There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
Continue to undertake detailed analyses of the financial and economic crisis , paying particular attention to the role of financial markets , and to present options to members and associate members which they may use , as appropriate , as inputs in the formulation of their relevant national policies , with a view to ensuring the attraction of a steady inflow of private capital ;  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Our current population strategy , which was defined in the declaration on population policy adopted in April 1988 and elaborated in the eleventh orientation plan for economic and social development , was also inspired by the Dakar / Ngor Declaration adopted in the capital of Senegal during the Third African Population Conference .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
Complementary policies are needed in a number of areas , for example in respect of supporting proper access to investment financing and venture capital ; facilitating access to new technologies and to match-making with foreign partners ; active labour market policies , including retraining for new technologies and activities ; unemployment insurance ; and the provision of basic infrastructure , industrial utilities and complementary services .  
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
The objectives were twofold : to collect comprehensive information on the stock of cross-border equities and long-term debt securities for use in the compilation or improvement of international investment position statistics ; and to allow the bilateral exchange of comparable data , in order to improve estimates of non-resident holdings of portfolio liabilities , as well as associated capital flows and investment income data .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Under this Act , foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impeding the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within the national territory .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
Policies for the prevention and the better management of financial crises have so far concentrated on particular areas , such as improved transparency , strengthened financial regulation , financial facilities better designed to support countries experiencing large capital outflows and currency collapses , and reduction of moral hazard problems in international lending and investment .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
San Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against capital punishment , firmly convinced that the abhorrent instrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by one human being on another can be considered neither a valid and effective answer to defend society nor a deterrent against the spreading of criminality .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
The key issues which need to be addressed if long-term capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Such perceptions of flaws in the existing Accord have led to pressure for regulatory changes , and underlie the new initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision for its reform . 16 The approach now envisaged rests on three pillars : minimum capital requirements , supervisory review of capital adequacy in accordance with specified qualitative principles , and market discipline based on the provision of reliable and timely information ( discussed in paras . 10-11 above ) . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
The Japanese Supreme Court had stated that capital punishment could be applied only when the criminals responsibility was extremely grave and the maximum penalty was unavoidable , taking into consideration , inter alia , the need for general prevention , the nature , motive and mode of the crime , the persistence and cruelty of the means of killing , the seriousness of the consequences , the number of persons killed , the feelings of the bereaved and the effect on society .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
Policy makers in other developing countries were encouraged by the international media to read the lesson of the Asian crisis , not as a cautionary tale about the dangers of opening capital markets without first developing the appropriate regulatory apparatus , but rather as evidence that State involvement in economic governance should be reduced . 
Although Haitis partners had been very understanding , the debt relief granted had proved insufficient to free up the capital needed to finance renewed economic growth .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows have presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The establishment of a single economic space and of the legal basis for a common market which shall guarantee the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour within the territories of the participating States , and equal conditions and guarantees for the activity of economic entities ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing the negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The current environment , driven by free market forces and unpredictable capital fluctuations had been favourable to countries which benefited from sound economic conditions , technology and capital but unfavourable to the majority of developing countries which were relatively uncompetitive and marginalized .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
The Argentine Republic has promulgated an act establishing that foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impending the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within Argentine territory .  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
My country reaffirms its principled position that just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based , first and foremost , on the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital .  
As you said , Sir , a very great tragedy has occurred in Venezuela as a result because of the persistent rains that have fallen throughout the year in the central part of the country , which , on 16 December , led to massive flooding and mudslides in the central mountain range , affecting densely populated regions , particularly the central coastal regions near the capital city and where the country ' s main airport and port are located .  
From the point of view of labour rights , globalization was encouraging fragmentation and uncertainty ; as TNCs escaped national accountability , the poor were becoming increasingly disenfranchised , subsidies formerly granted to labour were being redirected to attract international capital , and the burden of taxes was shifting increasingly from capital to labour .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
It also creates the institution of family capital assets ( administered jointly by the spouses ) , a juridical statute for the protection of the immovable property which constitutes the familys principal residence and the movable goods contained therein , in order to preserve them , irrespective of which spouse owns them and which matrimonial regime is adopted .  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
Thus , social policies designed to increase human capital in essence , health and education perform a vital role in ensuring that people have the assets required to gain access to a suitable position in the labour force , a decent wage and a reasonable level of well-being .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In order to do so , airlines have to be attractive enough to be accepted as members of alliances , as partners in code-sharing and other cooperative arrangements , as enterprises that may be successfully privatized through national or foreign capital , or as companies capable of absorbing market solutions such as franchising or other arrangements with world-class airlines .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
In order to ensure that the developing and emerging States derived the maximum economic benefit from the new arrangements , the Commissions legal standards and guidance must take careful note of international financial and capital markets and foster a willingness to modify existing national laws .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Market liberalization has led to spectacular , if not always consistent , growth , but it has also led to greater inequality and polarization within and among societies ; some regions have been mostly overlooked by private capital , and in all regions the swift withdrawal of investor confidence can lead to economic collapse and social distress .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
As a matter of definition of our priorities , we would prefer to devote greater political capital , as well as greater material resources , to conflict prevention and to supporting countries with unstable social , civil and economic structures .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
We have recognized that economic strength , and therefore national strength , can not be preserved by pursuing autarkic policies or total reliance on generating capital investments internally .  
The continuing transfer of capital , technology and managerial and entrepreneurial skills from the rich to the poorer countries has become the classic justification of global multinational activity .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
The key issues that need to be addressed if longterm capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Equity demanded that the transfer of capital and technology to the emerging economies should be driven not only by the need for cheap and abundant labour , but by a desire to create viable and sustainable production and fair access to international markets .  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
At an international level , coordinated taxation of international capital flows and support for universal human rights to minimal standards of living would also contribute to improving income distribution .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
First , trade liberalization and the demands of global capital markets and financial institutions have to varying extents constrained the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy options for social purposes , including employment and equity objectives .  
For the sixth survey , States were invited to list specific legal definitions of offences for which capital punishment could be imposed , according to whether the capital offences were considered ordinary or special .  
In an open system , national competitive economic purpose can sustain a pool of highly educated and flexible workers , an efficient infrastructure , sound money and a good quality of life so as to attract mobile financial and human capital .  
Provision was also made for modest increases in internal oversight and capital expenditures , as well as for special political missions whose mandates , though set to expire in 1999 , might be renewed for part or all of the coming biennium .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
That capital was represented by its countries potential for cooperation based on their common origins , longstanding bonds of solidarity and vision of a shared future .  
To some , it is an inevitable process driven by new technologies in electronic communication and transport , enabling information , persons , capital and goods to cross borders and reach the most remote corners of the globe at unprecedented speed .  
Under international law capital punishment shall not be applied to juvenile offenders , expectant or recent mothers , and those suffering from mental handicap or extremely limited mental capacity .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Whether natural or caused by humans , crises often cross borders , draining resources away from essential public services , reducing development investments , and destroying physical , natural , institutional and social capital .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Very harsh penalties were imposed on drug traffickers , ranging from life imprisonment to capital punishment , because drug trafficking was considered premeditated attempted homicide against innocent people .  
These countries thus bear special responsibility for supporting vigorous global economic growth and the expansion of international trade and in dampening abrupt changes in interest rates and in international capital markets .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
Although global ODA flows have been declining and they have become small relative to private flows of capital , it was reported that aid to the Pacific island developing countries has been maintained and will be required for some decades to come . 
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
The dynamic development of the financial system and the capital market demand reliable ground rules and strong regulatory frameworks in order to guarantee the stability of the relevant systems and the adequate protection of savers .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
The Supreme Council reviewed the bloody events that have taken place in the occupied Palestinian territories owing to the savage aggression , repressive measures and policies of closure and encirclement directed by Israel against a fraternal Palestinian people seeking the restoration of all of its legitimate rights , including its right to return and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
These measures included , in particular , improving the policy and operational framework for FDI , so as to put it on a par with best practice ; rationalizing fiscal incentives ; setting up a super agency to promote and facilitate investment ; fast-tracking privatization ; and implementing strategies for upgrading the human capital base .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
The Ministerial Council reviewed the Israeli practices of aggression against the Palestinian people , especially the escalation against towns , villages and camps , and the policy of closures and economic and political blockade being pursued by Israel against the fraternal Palestinian people demanding the restoration of its legitimate rights , including the right of return and its right to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
In that context , Pakistan had withdrawn all reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and had ratified the amendment to article 43 , paragraph 2 , on increasing the membership of the Committee on the Rights of the Child from 10 to 18 .  Pakistan had also promulgated a law which abolished capital punishment for juvenile offenders aged under 18 at the time of the crime ; it also prohibited keeping juvenile offenders in jail with adult prisoners or hardened criminals .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
An outcome of increased volatility of international financial conditions and frequent crises in emerging markets is the tendency to build up reserves as a safeguard against a rapid exit of capital and speculative attack on currencies . 
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
The complexity of managing East Timors public finances is compounded by the need to obtain donor support for the two primary trust funds ( the first funds the national budget , and the second supports capital investment and recovery ) , while coordinating other bilateral and multilateral development assistance .  
However , the Public Information Office is also faced with a population that has a high illiteracy rate , with inexperienced , inadequate and generally poor local media and with weak or non-existent communications infrastructure outside the capital and two provincial towns .  
The source stressed in conclusion the position of the State of Qatar and the States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in support of the Palestinian people in its just struggle to regain its legitimate rights , in accordance with the resolutions based on international legitimacy , the foremost of which is the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on its national soil with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital .  
He / she will establish and maintain contact with senior members of diplomatic missions , permanent missions to the United Nations and other high-level officials in capital cities , chief executives of NGOs and leaders of academic institutions , in particular influential scholars in the field of international relations and publicists in the areas of international law and criminal justice , on the substantive work and policies of the Tribunal .  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
They had been asked to establish an environment conducive to capital flows , yet foreign direct investment flows to the developing countries were continually shrinking and were expected to diminish by another 6 per cent in 2001 , especially since the climate in the developed countries was more uncertain , the risks were greater and investment returns were lower . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to submit , when practicable , for the consideration of the General Assembly , a comprehensive report on : the outcome of the schematic design ; options for deciding on the final scale of the project ; projected revenues and the cost of operating and maintaining the new visitors experience ; proposals for expanded commercial activities ; options for operating methodologies ; means of adjusting to changing situations ; procedures for the operation of the proposed capital improvement fund ; and a time-line for implementation . 
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development in support of the efforts of Governments to ensure , inter alia , full and equal access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology , as well as full and equal participation in all decision-making ;  
Experts mentioned the following as being among the specific difficulties faced by SMEs : demand volatility , and the consequent lack of transparency and predictability in the business environment ; large capital requirements ; weak linkages with international markets ; scarce information about commercial opportunities abroad ; and the difficulty in finding highly trained personnel .  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development in support of the efforts of Governments to ensure , inter alia , increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in all decision-making ;

In 1995 , the National Development Bank successfully organized 50-million US dollars in loans from foreign syndicates for the first time , and at the same time , undertook the transfer of foreign export credit for the projects such as the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Project and the second phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power , etc .  From the aspect of both national capital and foreign capital , it continually increases support for key construction projects and has played an active role in promoting China 's economic development .  
At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .  
During this period , this province recently approved a total of nearly 200 foreign business investment projects , almost doubling over the same period last year .  The contracted foreign capital utilized was 578-million US dollars ; signed contracts for foreign projects and the export of labor services were 347-million US dollars ; at the same time , nine foreign capital financial institutions such as the Overseas Chinese Bank of Singapore and the National Guard Life Insurance Company of Australia , etc . , have successively settled in Sichuan .  
This year , Sichuan can take new steps in opening up to the outside world .  Its main experience is that the provincial government encourages the expansion of foreign trade export and adopts a series of preferential support policies to attract foreign capital , such as " preferential policies in Sichuan Province for encouraging foreign investment " , etc . that the province promulgated and implemented , providing foreign merchants with a preferential and lenient policy environment .  
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that , since 1994 the number of " three-capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500 , and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700-million US dollars , which represented threefold and sevenfold increases , respectively , over the years before 1993 .

Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
The company has utilized and completely made liquid social assets of more than 10-billion yuan by employing forms such as mergers , acquisitions , etc . ; integrating its key development projects to attract overseas capital , FAW has successively established eighteen joint ventures with eight countries and regions .  
Employees in foreign invested enterprises are dispersed across industries , the real estate public service industry , the commerce and catering service industries , the construction industry , the farming , forestry , animal husbandry , side-line production and fishery industries , and the traffic , transport , and postal industries .  In recent years , some Chinese employees have gone to work in some sporadically appearing foreign capital financial institutions .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the US securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the US economy , and that the New York Stock Exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
Wuhan , in Hubei province , located in the center of China 's interior , will , in the future , put emphasis on utilizing foreign capital in the areas of the high-tech industry , basic industries , infrastructure construction , agricultural development , etc .  
Last year , although there was a drop in the quantity and the contract amount of recently approved projects utilizing foreign capital in Shandong Province , foreign capital actually utilized maintained growth , reaching over 4.2-billion US dollars , and increasing more than 17% compared with the previous year .  Of this amount , foreign merchants ' investment actually realized was over 3-billion US dollars , increasing 9% compared with the same period the previous year .  
In infrastructure , a number of expressway projects have been formally signed with the outside , and a number of municipal public infrastructure merchant-invitation projects have also been announced overseas , signifying the complete start of utilizing foreign capital in the areas of Shandong 's infrastructure .  
Xiaoling Wu also revealed that up to now , China 's domestic institutions have cumulatively issued US dollar equivalent foreign currency debts of about 17-billion US dollars on the international capital market , forcefully supporting the rapid , continuous and healthy development of the country 's economy .  
In order to meet the needs of investors , the " Shenye Holding Company " ' s market broker fully exercised distribution rights of excessive shares , with the corporate raised capital increasing from the original 400-million HK dollars to 532-million HK dollars .  The launching of the 650-million " H shares " of Shenzhen Expressway Stock Company , Ltd , right afterward was recently a great success , with raised capital surpassing 400-million HK dollars .  
According to information from the Provincial External Economy and Trade Committee , in 1996 , Shandong 's foreign-capital corporations ' exports achieved 5.49-billion US dollars , occupying 51% of total provincial export values ; the entire province 's actual utilized foreign capital occupies 14.7% of the whole society 's fixed asset investment ; foreign merchant investment corporation employees have reached 1.15-million people , occupying 10.9% of total industrial employees in the entire province .  
The entire province has actually utilized foreign funds of nearly 1-billion US dollars , and has established a large number of extroverted agricultural " three capital " enterprises which combine agriculture , industry , trade and technology and integrate manufacturing , supply and marketing , and through foreign merchants sales channels , it has also expanded its export of agricultural products .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
According to what was revealed in the meeting , as far as investment direction is concerned , Tianjin encourages Taiwanese investors to invest in infrastructure , base industries , funded technology concentrated industries , and high-technology projects , and to participate in the technological reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , to invest in third industry experimental projects .  Taiwanese financial capital and industrial capital institutions are welcome to come to Tianjin to build up financial organizations .  
Insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of China 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .  Products turned out by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched the material lives of our people .  
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
The utilization of foreign capital has made up the deficiency of funds needed for construction projects at home .  It has increased the state 's revenues and gains on foreign exchange , promoted the adjustment of economic structure , optimized industrial structure , accelerated integration of China 's economy with the world 's economy , and created a large amount of employment opportunities.In addition , products manufactured by foreign-funded enterprises have greatly enriched people 's material life .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
In 1999 , the " separation between revenue and expenditure " practice in public security , procuratorial , court , and industry and commerce departments had been extended down to the county level , while it was in practice in other fee and fine collecting departments at the central and provincial levels as well as at the provincial capital city level and the level of city whose mayor holds the same rank as vice provincial governor .  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
Wu Yi also expressed the hope that Hainan will adhere to the principle of being driven and boosted by the policy designed for it , by the application of science and technology , by introducing foreign equipment , technology , and capital , and by associating with domestic enterprises , in order to further build up the special economic zone . 
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
So , the " accession to the WTO " will not only be conducive to rejuvenating and benefiting the labor-intensive industries with strong international competitiveness but it will also be conducive to quickening the readjustment of the capital - and technology-intensive industries and enabling them to grow up at an early date .  Besides , the WTO entry will also be able to help normalize convoluted pricing signals and quicken the setup and improvement of the socialist market economic system .  
Practice over the past 21 years has proved that the policy of " the whole society engaging in afforestation and the whole nation committed to turning the country green " has brought into play the superiority of the socialist system and suits the actual condition of our country , which is faced with an arduous task of ecological building but lacks capital .  It has also significantly increased people 's awareness of the need to keep the country green .  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
Capital flow will have a greater influence and impact on a country 's economy , particularly the great circulation and speculation of short-term capital .  Without sound market operating mechanism , rational interest mechanism , and strict regulatory system , it will be extremely easy for the domestic economy to be controlled by the international market if we abolish the restrictions on capital outflow and inflow too early .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
The conveyance of policy must be rapid , prompt , and accurate ; market interest rates and flexible foreign exchange rate mechanisms must be closely coordinated ; and opportunities for speculative profit-taking in capital and foreign exchange must be prevented through a sound monetary and foreign currency market .  
The critical decision made by the Party 's Central Committee received enthusiastic responses from all over China , particularly from the Western Regions . A considerable number of cadres and people have cherished this rare opportunity more than others by quickly starting up , making general plans , conducting feasibility studies , inviting business , attracting capital , implementing measures , and making the best use of every minute .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
Equity capital should primarily be raised from the domestic and international capital markets , and oriented toward the public , the corporate investors , and the special investment funds as well .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Under the present turbulent and unstable international situation , we should pay special attention to the diversified forms and channels of making use of foreign capital so that we can gain the initiative in absorbing foreign capital .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
and facilitating the internationalization of the market , allowing Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises to seek listings on the domestic stock exchanges while encouraging qualified domestic enterprises to raise funds through initial public offerings on the overseas stock exchanges , and also allowing foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in enterprises in some competitive industries in China so that China 's capital market will be fully opened to foreign investors step by step .  
Starting last year , we implemented drastic reforms in such overall areas of the enterprises as management models , mechanisms for motion , and management scope .  We greatly increased overall planning and policy , liquidation and investment , capital management , organized marketing , science and technology research and development for customer service and handling of public relations , and basically realized transformation from a State administered company to large size enterprise group .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
Compared with other countries , in 1999 China 's overall economic amount ranked seven in the world , major industrial and farm product output ranked first in the world , total foreign trade amount ranked ten in the world , foreign exchange reserve ranked second in the world , international tourism ranked eight in the world , and attraction of foreign capital ranked second in the world .  
In order to realize a balanced growth of the national economy , economically developed countries have usually selected the backward areas for implementing a special opening up policy to attract foreign capital and personnel by means of opening up and preferential policies .  This can promote the economic development of the backward areas and further develop the national economy as a whole .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Third , we must make preparations ahead of time , guarding against and dispelling in a timely manner the risk of imbalances in our international balance of payments which may result from bringing in foreign capital improperly , and we should also enhance our oversight and advance warning regarding foreign capital flow , strengthening our statistical analysis of the international balance of payments .  
Accordingly , we should cultivate and develop domestic money markets by accelerating reform of the domestic investment and financing system , as well as creating a fair competition mechanism for domestic and foreign capital , making full use of the potential of the high domestic savings rate , being truly rational and effectively taking advantage of " two markets and two sources of funding " , thus avoiding over-dependence on outside sources of funding .  This is the main approach to guard against and dispel international balance of payment risks .  
With an aim of ensuring " victory during the fight " , these achievements were completed in line with the existing equipment and future tasks .  They demonstrated not only strong support capacity during the troops ' routine flight training but also outstandingly supported major military operations such as war tactics drill in the Western region and national grand military parade in the capital .  
Okinawa is a Japanese prefecture in southern Kyushu and comprises Okinawa , Miyako , Yaeyama and other islands .  The main Okinawa Island is 1,185 sq km at the center of the Ryukyu archipelago .  Northern hilly areas account for two-thirds of the entire island .  Naha , the capital at the south of Okinawa Island , is Okinawa Prefecture 's political and cultural center .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
At an assembly in the capital ardently welcoming back the Yugoslavian embassy personnel , Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech , calling for " the entire party and citizens of all nationalities across the country to turn the immense indignation toward NATO 's savage behavior and great patriotic passion into a powerful motivation to struggle together in one mind and heart for the ongoing strengthening of China 's economic might , national defense forces , and national solidification force " .  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
As disclosed by a source from the country 's Administration of Radio , Film , and Television who supervises cable television , the State Council will rush the approval of China 's administrative regulations on cable television through by the end of the year so that they may be handed over to the National People 's Congress for examination next year .  When the time comes , foreign capital involved in cable network investment in the country will be cleared up and play a supporting role in forming the " China Broadcast Television Network Cables Group . "  
Having witnessed improved economic life , people have started recognizing or supporting the SAR Government 's measures aimed at developing the economy , including measures for severely cracking down on illegal economic activities , for protecting intellectual property rights , for rectifying the market order , for building a much better international image for Macao , for raising the government work efficiency , for improving an internal investment environment , for inviting more outside investment or capital , and so on .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
The share of direct government investments among the total amount of investments society-wide will be reduced , while the share of independent , non-government investments , including individual , private , and foreign capital , will go up .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
The latest statistics show that China continues to be in front rank of the world in the amount of foreign capital used but , in light of the national condition that we have a vast territory but a dense population and there is a wide economic gap between regions , the use of foreign capital still needs to be expanded and its quality improved .  
Taiwan has a definite advantage in such areas as capital , specialized talents , buying and selling of technologies , enterprise management , and international marketing .  Taiwan businessmen are also blessed with the special advantage of language and ethnicity and thus have many favorable conditions in fighting for a share in the mainland market and in seizing investment and trade opportunities .  
The scale of foreign trade and import of foreign capital has been continually expanded , a pattern of opening up on all sides , in broad spheres , and at multiple levels has basically taken shape , and the marketization of the national economy has been elevated to a noticeable extent .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
Despite widespread concern that a US economic slowdown will affect China 's foreign capital intake , a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation expressed optimism : This year China will maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also will cause a significant structural improvement .  
Ma Xiuhong pointed out that China 's foreign capital intake proved to continue the dramatic upward trend in the first quarter of the year .  She believed that this year China would maintain a sizeable foreign capital intake , which also would cause a marked structural improvement .  
In recent years , our country is the developing country that attracted the largest amount of foreign funds , the stable economic growth and the continuing improvement of the investment environment in our country may enable our country to benefit from this round of international capital movement .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
When being told that most of the young workers came from rural areas , Hu Jintao praised them : You are hardworking and enthusiastic , have courage to make innovations , not only guaranteed the quality of construction but also lowered the costs of construction and raised the economic efficiency of the enterprises .  You have devoted your energy and sweat to the construction of the capital .  
In the last 10 years , China 's private enterprises ' average registered capital has increased from 93,000 yuan to 681,000 yuan , increasing by more than 6 folds , but each enterprise 's employment has been reduced from 18.1 persons to 13.4 persons , cutting back by as much as one-quarter .  
This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .  
In sharp contrast to the slump in fixed asset investments is the continued and abnormal rise in registered capital and output value of the civilian-run economy , represented by the private economic sector .  
During the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , the annual rate of increase in the private economic sector 's registered capital hovered between 36.3 percent and 43.1 percent ; the annual rate of increase in total output value ranged between 21.6 percent to 49.2 percent .  Both displayed a pattern of rapid and steady growth , and behind the rapid increase in capital seemed to be a strong investment momentum .  
Exceptions are cases where the common reserve fund is being converted to increase the capital stock , undistributed profits are being used to pay stock dividends , or reverse stock splits are being executed to reduce the total number of shares outstanding in accordance with relevant regulations .  
The municipal party committee explicitly requires : All major affairs in the capital city 's political , economic , cultural , and social life must be submitted to the Political Consultation Conference for deliberation .  In particular , before decisions are made on major projects and policies , before the change of administrative division of districts in the municipality , and before the formulation of local laws and regulations , political consultation must be conducted .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
Hong Kong serves as a diverse cultural capital , the development of religious sects has its freedom , there is sound social differentiation of " religious sects " developed by the people 's knowledge , and illegal behavior by " religious sects " is already regulated by Hong Kong law .  The day that the government of the SAR , ignorant of religion , enacts the " Anti-Heretical Cult Law " , all legitimate " religious sects " will be affected .  
By the end of May 2001 , the park had invested an accumulated total of over 8 billion yuan on the construction of its infrastructure , had used $ 4.2-billion of foreign capital , carried out construction on an area of 12 square km , completed the construction of high-level infrastructure , initially set up groups of advanced and high-tech industries with the electronics , information , precision machines , biological pharmaceutics and new materials industries as their core , and established a new management structure and operation mechanism .  
Any limited liability company in which the state owns shares ( including companies listed overseas ) making initial public offers or issuing additional shares must offer 10 percent state shares based on the total amount of capital raised .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
It is reported that Wang Jian , Wen Tiejun , Shi Xiaoming , and other scholars at the State Council think tanks and the China Research Society for Economic Restructuring recently analyzed the US Asia-Pacific strategy , as well as the motive behind a series of its provocative acts against China in the wake of the Sino-US aircraft collision incident , against the background of US capital crisis and from the international economic trends .  
In a recent speech at a forum in Zhejiang , entitled " New and High Technology , and Risk Investment , " the renowned economist Wu Jinglian said : With the evaporation of bubbles of the Nasdaq , which represents US high-tech shares , there has been an upsurge of Chinese students returning home from their high and new technology jobs in the United States . As Zhejiang has the features of rich private capital and flexible enterprise mechanisms , the wave of returned Chinese students from abroad will bring new opportunities to Zhejiang 's economic development .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .  China ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of assimilating foreign direct investment .  
The Asian financial crisis unexpectedly broke out in 1997 and brought serious impacts to our neighboring countries and regions .  The party Central Committee judged the hour and sized up the situation and timely worked out a series of measures to regulate the macro-economy , thus ensuring the steady development of our foreign export trade and foreign capital inflows despite the unfavorable international economic environment .  
Jia Qinglin said : Over 80 years , especially over more than 50 years since the founding of new China , under the leadership of the CPC , Beijing , as a time-honored ancient capital city well-known to the world , underwent earthshaking changes .  It changed from a capital of a declining feudal empire into a great capital of the socialist motherland , and is now marching toward a modern international metropolis .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
In meeting with delegates , CPC General Secretary and State Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed that adhering to carrying out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside , attracting more and better foreign capital and developing an open-style economy will be of major significance in furthering the continued rapid and healthy development of our national economy .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
Qiu Xiaohua was of the view that this year the theme of China 's economy is steady growth .  He predicted that steady growth in China 's domestic demand will be maintained in the near future and growths in both government and private investment will see a good development trend .  He added that , because of the government 's policy of encouraging utilization of foreign capital , it is expected that growth in foreign capital utilization also will be quite satisfactory .  
As China 's accession to the WTO is approaching , the government has changed their views on civilian-run economic sectors , and civilian capital has also increased .  As a result , the authorities responsible for the media formally clarified their stand a month ago on foreign capital 's participation in media operations .  
Chief engineer Wen Faming of the provincial communications department helped an unqualified contractor with the family name of Zheng obtain a construction contract and accepted 660,000 yuan and HK $ 270,000 when he was head of the capital construction division and chief engineer of the provincial communications department and a responsible person of leading groups for competitive bidding and approvals in highway construction .  
The games we are going to host will be the Olympics Games of humanities , as ours is a country with ancient civilization and Beijing , the capital , has a brilliant history and culture of more than 3,000 years .  As the world is ablaze with different colors , the grand cultural exchange to be carried out through the Olympics Games will make the world even more colorful and splendid . "

adopt multiple forms , utilize foreign capital in an active , rational , and effective way , pay greater attention to importing advanced technology , modern management , and people with professional skills while absorbing foreign capital ;  
Since illegal capital outflow is a clandestine economic activity , it is not included in regular statistics .  Because of this , experts say that any attempt to gauge the scale of China 's illegal capital outflow can only give a rough estimate , rather than an accurate figure .  
A relevant expert with the State Development Planning Commission has expressed the following view : The fundamental solution to the problem of illegal capital outflow driven by the desire to seek the maximum profit is to allow the free outflow of capital .  
As a result , cross-strait tensions have continued ; popular morale has been shaken ; the investment environment has worsened ; there have been a constant outflow of capital and a continued plunge in the stock market ; the people 's wealth has shrunk ; unemployment has risen significantly ;  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
Despite China 's rather strict control over the media industry and the many obstacles foreign capital is bound to encounter in accession , covetous foreign financial groups , started from the periphery , have already sought ways to establish ties with the media inside China through various channel and gradually infiltrated into this fertile land of media industry .  
Mou went on : In the new century , we 're bound to see a faster flow of goods , services , information , capital , and personnel .  With global economic cooperation constantly renewed and upgraded in terms of content and mode , we 're also bound to witness endless drastic changes in global trade in terms of operational speed , operational mode , and enterprises ' production mode and operative mode as well .  
4 .  The Government should assess the feasibilities of establishing an offshore capital market .  According to international regulation , Taiwan should be prepared to establish an offshore capital market that operates independently from the domestic market .  Taiwan should attract overseas businesses , including the Taiwan businesses now operating on the Mainland , to become listed businesses or to issue securities in US dollar in this capital market .  
Generally speaking , fluctuations in the exchange rate for the RMB are primarily driven by the following factors : domestic economic growth trends , situation of China 's international balance of payments , changes in interest rates inside and outside of China , the degree of liberalization of capital markets and social stability .  
After China 's entry to the WTO , she will have to act according to the relevant regulations , and with the basic premise of protecting the stability of the renminbi , use a phased liberalization of Chinese domestic capital markets .  This is because the protection of the exchange rate 's fundamental stability is beneficial to the long-term stability of Chinese economic growth .  
Meanwhile , the city should also vigorously improve its investment environment , enhance both the quality and efficiency of its foreign fund utilization , and gradually meet the requirement of ensuring a simultaneous growth between its introduction of capital and its introduction of advanced technologies , modern management concepts , and people with professional skills .  
The state has clearly laid down : " Defining property rights follows the principle of ' the investor profits , ' " and " that portion of after-tax profits of enterprises owned by the whole people that are formed through the use of state capital and from funds inserted in the course of operations which is , with state permission , retained by the enterprises as increased investment , together with the surplus public funds and undistributed profits drawn from after-tax profits are defined as state assets . "  
As China has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of Renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
China 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
He said : Since foreign capital shall be barred from news channels and the issue of jointly producing programs with foreign investors for certain professional channels has been placed on the agenda for discussion , all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies and the local departments concerned shall be banned from holding discussions with foreign investors or conjecturing the central policies . 
Thanks to the originally sound economic foundation , better transport facilities , and more qualified personnel , it was more convenient for the eastern region to attract foreign capital and increase economic contacts with the countries and regions outside the country .  Obviously , focusing the development on the eastern region could reap greater and faster economic results , which was already proved by facts , as tremendous achievements in the economic development had been attained in the eastern region .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
Some relevant experts believe that after these mineral-exploration rights newly drafted by the Chinese Government are expanded and opened up , a large amount of foreign capital , technologies , and talented people will be attracted to take part in the risk exploration and development of mineral resources in Central and West China , which will play an active propelling role to the further exploration of the rich mineral resources in the whole country .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
According to their analysis , experts maintained : Factors , such as the accelerated economic recovery in the Asian region , steady domestic economic growth , and the acceleration of China 's entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] have played an important role in the recovery of foreign capital utilization .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Wu Jinglian also stated that although state-owned economy does not account for a high proportion of GDP now , it remains the main controller of scarce economic resources ; hence , on the basis of withdrawing state capital or reducing in varying degrees holdings of state shares and diversifying equity shares , it is necessary on the one hand to revamp China 's large and medium-sized enterprises into modern companies that match international practice ;  
However , financial globalization will also separate the flow of international capital more and more from the operation of physical economy , lead to disorderly large-scale capital flow , hold the risks of financial crisis , and make some economic entities partially lose their independent economic policymaking power and their ability to the macro economy .  
In doing the anti-drought work , we must make overall plans , take all factors into consideration , bring about temporary as well as permanent solutions to the problem , and give comprehensive treatment by combining engineering measures with biological measures and management measures , combining capital construction of water conservancy works with construction of ecological environment , and combining rational development with strict protection and scientific utilization in a bid to properly manage , protect , and utilize the limited water resources .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
Last year , international investors were not enthusiastic in making investments in Asia because of the influence of the Asian financial crisis .  Total amount of foreign capital imported by China also dropped .  However , the EU 's actual investment in China still reached $ 4.47 billion , an increase of 4 percent over 1998 .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded . 
All levels of local people 's governments and relevant departments of the State Council have to formulate preferential policies in light of local conditions , such as reduction or exemption of fees for land sold , tax exemption on supplementary fees , and so on , so as to guide social capital , encourage and support social forces to run public welfare venues for teenage students ' activities .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
Software enterprises that are listed on the pioneering industry board and that give stock options to internal high-level managerial personnel and key technological personnel in the enterprises shall reveal this practice in detail in their prospectus for share flotation in raising capital .  They shall also provide the necessary explanatory materials to stock exchanges according to the demands of the regulations for listing on the pioneering industry board .  
The top leaders of five nations : China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Tajikistan , met in Dushanbe not long ago and issued a statement , reiterating their joint efforts to strike blows at national splittism , international terrorism , and religious extremism . ( referred to as three forces hereunder for short ) .  They also decided to set up an antiterrorism organ in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstand capital .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
As a result of rising oil prices , industrial product prices bottomed out in the first half of the year , with ex-factory prices of industrial products rising two percent and prices of capital goods rising 4.3 percent .  This indicates that with domestic demand expanding , the rise in upstream product prices will cause consumer goods prices to rise , thereby further improving the situation of deflation that has existed for two years .  In addition , enterprise deposits rose substantially .  
The residents of Okinawa remember with pride that they were once citizens of the Ryukyu Kingdom , a kingdom that possessed a unique aquatic culture in East Asia . For several hundreds of years this kingdom had romantic personnel , economic , and cultural exchanges with China , Southeast Asia , and other countries .  Up to today , the Okinawan people still display their precious past to tourists in their capital and other museums , showing a broad sense of caring .  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .  
Additionally , the new " procedures " have standardized and systemized the measures the supervisory and management organs adopted to manage financial companies and have realized the unified supervision and management of the domestic and foreign capital , the domestic and foreign currencies , and the scheduled and unscheduled operations of financial companies .  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
The official responsible for the State Administration of Environmental Protection said that the main reason for the relatively low rate of key state enterprises fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements is the outstanding structural pollution in the state 's key enterprises , the difficulties in tackling pollution , depression in enterprise production , and a lack of capital .  
First , it is necessary to step up law enforcement .  Second , it is necessary to cooperate with the State Economic and Trade Commission and other departments and implement the relevant policies and handle the technological and capital matters that will enable the large and medium state enterprises to fulfill the anti-pollution requirements .  Third , it is necessary to further strengthen basic work of fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements in industry , analyze the progress of work , find the focal and difficult points , and offer meticulous and classified guidance .  
The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
The downward trend of foreign capital inflow was checked in the first half of this year thanks to the upward trend of the international economy and the economic recovery of Asia .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .  
China has ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of foreign capital inflow .  It is not realistic to expect China to witness a high , sustainable growth in foreign capital inflow as it did in the middle of the 1990 ' s .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
As of the end of this year , China has successively approved the establishment of an accumulated total of more than 350,000 foreign-funded enterprises , with the relevant contracts involving foreign investment amounting to more than $ 630 billion ; and the foreign capital actually utilized over these years has exceeded $ 320 billion .  
The representatives of retired veteran cadres who are in Beijing , responsible persons of every relevant department of the army , heroic models of troops , militiamen in the capital , members of army-men families and revolutionary martyrs families , and representatives of former Kuomintang personnel who launched righteous revolts also attended the reception .  
and 4 ) allowing foreign-invested enterprises that come up to the required standards to be listed in China 's stock markets trading A-shares and B-shares , expanding the business ranges of the investment companies established by multinational corporations in China , simplifying the procedures for examination and approval , screening and adjusting pertinent policies that are detrimental to the absorption of foreign capital , and so on .  
Eliminating the regulatory tax on fixed-asset investments has provided a certain amount of relief for real estate-related business taxes , contract taxes , and land-value increment taxes , stimulating the ability of the real estate industry to drive economic growth and activating capital which was lying idle because of the large number of vacant buildings .  
Third , to facilitate the domestic economic and capital structural adjustment and enhance the international competitiveness of the national industries , it is also necessary to formulate new tax policies and adjust the existing ones under the precondition of flexibly applying the WTO rules and in light of the requirements of the state 's new industrial policies .  
In October the same year , the Bank of China promulgated the " Notice Concerning Risk Control by Commercial Banks While Handling International Settlement of Forward Letters of Credit . " It provides that " commercial banks , in handling their forward letters of credit business , must strictly follow state policies for foreign exchange control and the use of foreign capital , and they must have a genuine background of commodity trade . "  The notice also requires commercial banks to establish sound mechanisms for internal management and control .  
Resolving only the issue of poverty in developing countries is far from enough .

Since Clinton , who had come from " a remote and backward place , " had limited knowledge and experience , and his aides and staff also lacked experience , he repeatedly made mistakes after he assumed office .

To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .

Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .

The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
A person in charge of the CSRC said that the current policy readjustment was made mainly due to the consideration that marked changes have taken place in the macroeconomic situation regarding the capital movement of foreign exchange in China , and corresponding adjustments to the market orientation , rules , functions , and so on have been put forward in line with the requirements of the national economic development .

There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .  The theory is that , in a liberalised global financial system , international capital flows reward countries with sound economic policies and punish those which pursue unbalanced and inconsistent policies .  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
He also considered that the most productive focus for international and national economic reforms lay in the four key areas of strengthening financial markets , reducing vulnerability to short term capital flows , promoting greater transparency at all levels , and involving private creditors in debt resolution arrangements .  
Equally important are the possession of a stable and liquid capital market , with world-class market infrastructure , making use of the most advanced information technology and telecommunications , sophisticated but flexible regulation , strong foundations for the rule of law , high calibre personnel and professionals , and political and social stability " .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .

In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
This is particularly relevant to Hong Kong as an international financial centre where non-domestic financial business and movements in portfolio capital unrelated to economic developments intrinsic to Hong Kong are abundant .

These include an excellent business environment , world-renowned physical infrastructure such as the port and the airport , an open market economy , free flow of information , freedom of speech ; the rule of law ; and Hong Kong 's position as a world class international financial centre and Asia 's largest venture capital centre .  
As for promoting technological entrepreneurship , the Small Entrepreneurship Research Assistance Programme under the ITF provides pre-venture capital funding on a matching basis to small , technology-based and entrepreneurship driven companies to undertake projects with innovative and technology content , thereby increasing their chance of successful development of new products , new processes or new services .

Non-profit-making PISs are eligible for land grants at nominal premium and capital grants ( up to 100% of the cost of building a standard design primary or secondary public sector school of the same student population ) for the construction of school premises .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
The re-export volume of capital goods increased by 10.1% in April 2001 over a year earlier .  Notable increases in re-export volume were recorded for scientific , medical , optical , measuring , and controlling instruments and apparatus ; and transport equipment .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , slackened sharply to a meagre 0.4% growth in real terms in the second quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , from a strong leap of 11.5% in the first quarter .  
The GDP deflator , as a broad measure of overall price change in the economy , declined by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , much narrowed from the 1.7% decrease in the first quarter .  This was mainly attributable to a smaller decrease in the price deflator for gross domestic fixed capital formation and a renewed increase in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure in the second quarter .  
The Leisure and Cultural Services Department ( LCSD ) has drawn up an accelerated programme for the delivery of 64 capital works projects in the coming five years involving leisure and cultural facilities at a total estimated cost of $ 8.7 billion to meet community demands .  
* First , we must invest in human capital in a sustained manner and on a vast scale , sufficiently to form a deep , strong base of brainpower to support a knowledge economy with high value-added economic activities .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
The first and foremost is our open society , an independent judiciary , a transparent and efficient government , a level playing field , a business friendly environment , free flow of information and capital and all of which make us one of the best places of doing business . 
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , had a somewhat faster growth of 3.7% in real terms in the third quarter of 2001 over a year earlier , having eased back from an 11.5% surge in the first quarter to a 1.3% increase in the second quarter . 
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .  
In the capital and financial account , despite the austere economic environment worldwide , there was still a substantial injection of equity capital into the local economy in the fourth quarter , leading to a further net direct investment inflow .  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
" Hong Kong 's competitive advantages include an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , jurisdiction open to foreign lawyers and a free flow of capital and information , " he said .  
At a time when Asian economies are showing incipient signs of recovery against an improved external environment , international capital flows are triggering back to the region but in a more cautious and discriminate manner than before .  Investors are now a lot more selective about who may lend to and where they put their money .  
We will focus on the development of these niches .  Harnessing our sophisticated infrastructure , robust legal system and intellectual property protection framework , established international business experience and network , and a thriving capital market with high capital raising capability , we will continue to promote the industrialization of research findings and create an enabling environment for further technological advancement .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , plummeted by 16.5% in real terms in the first quarter of 2002 over a year earlier , after a 6.1% fall in the fourth quarter of 2001 . 
This was mainly attributable to an enlarged decline in the price deflator for exports of goods and a moderated rise in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure , which together more than offset a narrowed decrease in the price deflator for gross domestic fixed capital formation and a renewed rise in the price deflator for exports of services .  
He said : " Hong Kong offers numerous advantages for fund managers through a free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified fund management professionals , minimal government bureaucracy , state-of-the-art telecommunications and simple and low corporate tax . "  
China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
For our economy to remain vibrant and competitive , we must upgrade the calibre of our human capital and ensure the sustainability of our economic and social development by developing a comprehensive population policy and attracting more talents to Hong Kong , with due regard to the direction of our economic development , talent demand , land resources , migration figures ( including the number of arrivals from the Mainland ) , and the need to secure job opportunities for local workers .  
Miss Willis added that Hong Kong 's constitution , the Basic Law , protects the key ingredients essential to the territory 's ongoing development as an economy and a society .  These include the free flow of capital and goods , a freely convertible currency , our retained status as a separate Customs and Immigration territory , and the right to maintain its own shipping register and to negotiate its own air services agreements .  
China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
Ms Leung said that with its sophisticated telecommunications network , favourable geographical location , sound financial system , free capital flow and transparent investment environment , Hong Kong has developed into a major international financial centre and made many achievements .  
This was mainly attributable to an accelerated drop in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure and for gross domestic fixed capital formation , as well as a renewed fall in the price deflator for government consumption expenditure .  
" Much of our future success , like our past success , will depend on Hong Kong 's unchanging fundamentals : free flow of capital and information , an independent judiciary based on the rule of law , clean and efficient government , and a simple and low tax regime .  Add to this , no exchange controls , transparent regulation and state-of-the-art telecommunications , " Mr Ma said .  
Within the GDP deflator , the domestic demand deflator had an enlarged year-on-year decline of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2002 .  This was attributable to a larger fall in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure , for gross domestic fixed capital formation , and for government consumption expenditure .  
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
Mr Ma said , " To keep Hong Kong 's capital market moving forward , we have to make sure that our regulatory standards are always on a par with international standards .  By upgrading the quality of our market , Hong Kong 's listed companies would be more attractive to international investors and their market capitalization is set to grow .  This will be conducive to attracting more quality mainland private and state enterprises to get a listing in Hong Kong . "  
Mr Ho added that if the directors or management of a company committed acts such as fraud or illegal transfer of assets or capital from the insolvent company to another company , this would have adverse impact on the subrogation income of the PWIF , as only a small proportion of the payment advanced to the employees could be recovered from the remaining assets of the employer .  
While many larger foreign enterprises have advantages in capital , human and technical resources , professional knowledge , experience in project management and implementation , and international connection , Hong Kong enterprises also enjoy unique strengths in developing the telecommunications and IT markets in the Mainland . 
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
We will step up efforts to promote the economic potential of Hong Kong and the PRD . We will actively open up new markets , bringing in more foreign capital , attracting foreign talent , and encouraging more multinational corporations to set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong .  
He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government had been pursuing vigorous infrastructural and administrative initiatives to promote freer flow of goods , people , capital and information and to leverage Hong Kong 's economic integration with the region .  These included 24-hour boundary crossings , streamlined visit procedures , and plans for the construction of a bridge linking Hong Kong to Macau to the western part of the PRD .  
It has a world-class financial and banking system with a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , a simple and low tax regime , an independent judiciary based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , as well as free flow of capital and information . "  
After making reference to overseas experience , seeking advice from the local plumbing trade and conducting trials with successful results , the Administration decided in 2000 that dual flush devices are suitable for use in Hong Kong although such devices may have a higher capital and maintenance costs .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
In regard to capital expenditure , we need to set aside about $ 0.3 billion for the installation of particulate reduction devices on pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles , and for the provision of a one-off grant to encourage early replacement of diesel public light buses with liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) or electric ones to further improve roadside air quality .  
He urged corporations in both the public and private sectors to actively consider issuing bonds as a means for raising capital in light of the current market environment of record low bank deposit rates and uncertain equity market .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
The Companies Ordinance should be amended to require unlisted public companies or private companies , if directed to do so by holders of not less than 5% of all the nominal issued share capital of the company , to disclose full details of all elements of individual director 's remuneration package .  
I am confident because Hong Kong continues to enjoy many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
" With excellent business infrastructure , a highly qualified workforce , free flow of goods , capital and information and a transparent regulatory system , Hong Kong is an ideal location for retailers to establish their regional operations .  
Addressing some 100 guests at a reception hosted by the Swiss Chinese Chamber of Commerce , Mr Ma outlined Hong Kong 's fundamental strengths and efforts in maintaining its status as an international financial centre and the premier capital formation centre of the Mainland , the enhanced attractiveness to foreign investors following the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements , and the efforts and achievements in the financial services sector including the encouraging development of the Hong Kong bond market .  
Mr Ma noted that Hong Kong is the Mainland 's major international capital centre .  As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
" As an advance user of information systems , and having extensive experience in the development and deployment of computer applications , access to the latest technology , entrepreneurial spirit , and an active and sound capital market ; Hong Kong can play a key complementary role within the PRD Region to develop the information industry , riding on the abundance of competent IT professionals and potential market in the Mainland , " Mr Lai added . 
As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies , as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
In addition , Hong Kong has many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier . 
Additionally , Hong Kong has many comparative advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , goods and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
Among Hong Kong 's key attributes are : the rule of law , backed by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for all businesses , whether local or foreign-owned ; the free flow of capital and a totally convertible currency ; freedom of information ; clean government ; and low taxes .  
This includes a level playing field and unrestricted movement of capital , together with a transparent regulatory structure , an independent legal system and a simple , low tax regime . "  
To make maximum use of the materials and lands has always been the ultimate goal in our economic reconstruction . It is essential , at this crucial hour , to develop a larger and better labor force and to enhance skills to meet the demands of working capital and of more intensive industrial needs .  
At that time the social order was stable the economy was thriving and the suburbs of Changan and Loyang were thickly populated . The capital , Changan , was the political , economic , and cultural center of Asia .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
With a viable stock market the average citizen can also participate in the development of the economy . Venture capital companies are a nascent industry in Taiwan and there are disagreements as to where to go and how fast to get there . There are regulations limiting venture capital to 15% of the total capitalization of any one company .  
Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Under the imperial examination system , the friends and relatives of a scholar traveling to the capital to take the final examination would customarily present him with a duck as a farewell gift , because the Chinese character for duck contains the phonetic chia , meaning number one or first place . Hospitable innkeepers in the capital would cook pigs ' feet ( t'i ) for the candidates as a sign that their names would be listed ( t'i ) on the roll of successful candidates .  
Funafuti , the largest island and the site of the capital , has only one road , which runs around the island . The road is paved with stone and lined with coconut and banana trees , whose broad , close leaves , brimming with a rich , tropical exuberance , obscure the view of the traditional grass huts behind .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
So when the stock prices fell , it was either time to tighten the belt or capital flows dried up altogether . For small and medium enterprises , in August stock certificates were redeemed at a rate of 4.6 per thousand . The balance sheet performance of most companies on the market was also not hopeful : from the reports of the first half of the year , of the 192 companies on the board , 33 reported losses outright .  
Looking at it from the point of view of the domestic and external economic situations , the outlook is not very rosy . Because just now the world economy is performing poorly , market expansion is extremely tough . At the same time there is inflationary pressure in Taiwan , so that the government can not devalue the NT dollar to enhance export competitiveness , nor can it adopt a loose money supply policy to free up capital for enterprises .  
Especially after the end of the Second World War , which left the country , like the U . S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
Q . Some People are worried that with the use of cheap and abundant mainland labor , some of our labor-intensive industries will transfer investment and set up factories on the mainland which could influence the speed of our own industrial upgrading . They are also worried that when the mainland has absorbed our technology and capital , in the future they can turn around and destroy Taiwan 's native industries . What is your view ?  
The narrow streets are crowded with smoke-belching old cars discarded from the US . , the dilapidated wooden houses are gnawed by termites , and hurricanes are a source of constant trepidation ( after Belize City was devastated by one in 1961 , the government decided to build a new capital , Belmopan , in the center of the country ) .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
The PRC is an enormous economic unit with the potential for explosive growth . Like a " black hole , " it could absorb and exhaust Taiwanese capital and technology . Further , the political standoff between the two sides has yet to be resolved . Commercial competition may have a complex impact on all this , and should not be seen as a simple economic problem .  
Looking in turn at the three major forms of enterprises in the mainland today , state-run enterprises still labor under a heavy burden of weak incentives created by the " iron rice bowl " ; private enterprises are still in their infancy ; and township collective enterprises , which stand between these first two types in terms of scale , are mainly rural , and still lack the capital , information , and trained personnel to pose a direct challenge to Taiwan firms .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
If the government did not take responsibility for major infrastructure , the private sector-devoid of capital in those early days-could never have done so itself . And it was unthinkable to allow a few people outside the state to control essential goods and services . Thus public ownership of key industries in Taiwan-sugar , salt , steel , petroleum , water , electricity-was based on the needs of a particular era .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Tsai Yuan-pei had been living in France when he received a telegram from the Ministry of Education , hoping to entice him to come back to take the reins at Beida : " The nation is returning to normal , and urgently in need of education . Now we are making your virtuous self master of the capital 's highest academic institution . "  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
Furthermore , in the past it was easy to start a business with little capital , and both blue and white collar workers would aim to set up on their own once they had saved some money . " No-one is content to remain a lowly member of the working classes - - everyone wants to better themselves .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
No taste like home Old Confucius was not the only one who was partial to raw fish . Poet Zhang Han of the Western Jin ( 265-317 ) was appointed an official in the capital Luoyang . But when the autumn winds began to blow he was so overcome with nostalgia for the thick watershield soup and sliced raw sea bass of his native Suzhou that he said : " What matters most in life is to be content .  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
Yu Tzong-shian explains that a financial economy is characterized by high risk plus high profits . With rapid flows of information and capital it becomes essential to establish fair rules of the game , along with a tight regulatory regime for the finance sector .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
Advantages that were once monopolized by Taiwan and the other Asian dragons , including close economic cooperation with the leading industrial nations , a cheap and productive workforce , and capital reserves built on the back of high savings rates , have gradually been lost to other countries .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
Many of the works on display are considered to be national treasures in the mainland ; indeed , they are recognized as consummate works of art by experts in the international community , as well . This exhibit offers the opportunity to learn not only about the cosmopolitan nature of the Tang dynasty and its capital , Chang'an , but also allows us to recognize the Tang as the most glorious of ages , in terms of art , culture , Buddhism , and military and economic strength .  
The impact of Chiung Yao and Young Pei-pei inspired one Taiwanese producer after another to follow in their footsteps . Demand for specialized film sites in the mainland rose sharply , and with capital raised from various parties , a host of film studios were established , directly managed by or aided by members of Taiwanese artistic circles , each specializing in a different genre and era .  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
Accordingly , the proposal to give temporary work to the long-term unemployed is designed to maintain their hope for future employment . This valuable investment would assist them in gradually becoming more productive and finding suitable work . The intangible " social capital " that would accumulate is not something readily measured by GNP .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
Wu Se-hwa states that capital for cultural creative industries includes the following : copyrighted music , literature , fine arts and animation ; locations that can serve as the background for creativity , such as historic sites and natural scenery ; creative talent ; and language or customs that reveal the special flavor of an area .  
What 's more , various kinds of economic assistance , loans and insurance require real estate to be put up as collateral , but for creative and cultural industries , for which creativity and talented personnel represent their true capital , these requirements are entirely inappropriate .  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
But all good things must come to an end , and during the reign of Emperor Guangxu ( 1875-1895 ) , provincial governor Liu Mingchuan decided that Changhua 's port at Lukang was too silted and shallow , and gradually it fell into disuse . Liu chose to move the provincial capital to Taichung , thus laying the foundations for that city 's future growth , while Changhua , which had depended on shipping through Lukang , lost its luster .  
But there was nothing to smile about in this passage : " In 1241-1242 , Mongol cavalry led by Genghis Khan 's grandson Batu Khan captured Urgench , the capital of the Central Asian state of Khwarazm , massacred its inhabitants , broke its dykes , and wreaked great havoc . In 1241 , the Mongols burned and plundered Budapest and killed countless of its citizens , and in 1258 they also sacked the city of Baghdad in Mesopotamia . Hundreds of thousands were butchered , and magnificent buildings and countless art treasures were set ablaze . "  
" The old idea of saving money for retirement is no longer feasible . Currency can lose value and is really not dependable . Right now people should be spending all their effort at saving up human capital , raising their hireability , so that when a person goes out looking for a job he can actually get hired , " says Hsin Ping-lung . Hireability is based on two factors : good health and lifelong functional learning .  
Since Myanmar reformed its financial and banking system in recent years , 39 foreign bank representative offices and 17 local private banks have been set up in the capital

due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
BUCHAREST , January 24 ( Xinhua ) Romania has absorbed a total of 650-million dollars worth of foreign capital last year a sum equal to all of the foreign money flowing into the country in the previous four years  
Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
A suitable regulatory , legal and supervisory environment is a crucial element in effective private sector development , macroeconomic structural programmes , development of entrepreneurship and effective capital market development .  
Hence , investing in human capital , improving public administration and basic social services and creating an environment in which the private sector can play an essential role in the economic transformation are of paramount importance .  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Ever increasing dependence on information technology systems and their high level of sophistication , linked to the heavy capital investment required , have made information technology crucial to the effective functioning of UNDP .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) , despite its high capital cost , offers specific attractions for small islands because of their typical location close to deep oceans and warm surface water .  
A dozen countries in Asia and Latin America , characterized by financial analysts as " emerging markets " , received most of the capital inflow , while the vast majority of developing countries have not been touched by the growth in net financial transfers .  
While national efforts are the key to a successful export strategy , bilateral and multilateral support , including longterm capital , should make a major difference in reducing the period required to achieve the expected results . 
Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
After the provisional Government disintegrated , an interim Government was proclaimed on 8 April 1994 but left the capital on 12 April 1994 as fighting between the armed forces and the Rwandese Patriotic Front ( RPF ) intensified .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
The transfer of major financial resources to and from our markets causes great instability in capital flows in the world , leading to concern and uncertainty , and threatens the accumulated efforts of our peoples to establish a more just , more orderly and more stable economic system .  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
We are , however , alert to the dangers associated with that sector and , while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such institutions , we must be ever on guard for white-collar criminals who , as part of their everyday activity , launder their ill-gotten gains through the international financial systems , using both public - and private-sector capital projects for this purpose .  
We recognize the values and the capital that adults have left to us , and we are proud that they have forged a social existence which allows no room for intolerance based on racial , religious or cultural considerations .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
It also reaffirmed support for the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their rights to return , to self-determination , and to establish their independent State on their national soil , with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital ; as well as support for the international programmes for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories .  
It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
To create a focus in national development plans and budgets on investment in human capital , with special policies and programmes directed at rural areas , the urban poor , women and children .  
None the less , some of the objectives of the Task Force are being addressed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics , which was established in 1992 with a membership of international and national statistical agencies to implement the recommendations contained in two IMF reports : " Report on the measurement of international capital flows " and " Report on the world current account discrepancy " .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Mindful of the need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
The economic returns resulting from those biotechnology applications that have been supported by venture capital have encouraged a steady increase in investment in biotechnology , yet the beneficial results of applications in developing countries and the benefits derived from such applications are not perceived to have extended much beyond the business community .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The major common economic characteristic of the poor is that they lack productive assets , either in terms of physical or human capital .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
In part this is because of the role of external forces ( e.g . , economic growth and interest rates in the OECD area ) in " diverting " funds from OECD economies to the emerging markets and also because other influences are of a transient or finite nature ( e.g . , resulting from privatizations and returning flight capital ) .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
At its twenty-fifth session , held in April 1994 , the Commission approved the present programme of work , paying special attention to the situation of the economies of the region , which have been characterized by expansion of economic activity with relative price stability , vast inflows of external capital and some relief from the debt burden .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
A prior requirement , however , would be the removal by individual countries of the range of impediments that currently limit intraregional capital flows , including foreign-exchange controls , legislation and regulations , that discriminate against foreign investors , restrictions on transfers and other direct and indirect measures designed to influence capital flows .  
This was the case for countries that had fixed exchange rates and whose economies were characterized by inordinate inflation and for still others that experienced volatile movements of exchange rates , which often changed much more than internal prices over time , as a result of capital flight and speculation as well as other effects of international capital markets .  
Measures to foster effective provision of infrastructure services by local government included ( a ) establishing a rational , transparent , legal foundation for local government with an appropriate degree of local discretion over issues of local interest ; ( b ) implementing a more appropriate assignment of revenues providing greater local autonomy over user charges and local taxes ; and ( c ) introducing more systematic and transparent criteria for allocating capital investment funding .  
Consequently , re-emphasis on social infrastructure , and on " social capital " 1 / is now seen as indispensable for avoiding the pervasive cycle of economic decline , increasing poverty and environmental degradation from which many countries are now struggling to escape .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
The establishment of open relations and transparent cooperation among the States in the region in all areas , such as economy , trade , transport , telecommunications , environmental protection and other areas of common interest for independent and versatile development of the States and of the region as a whole based on the openness of the region to all neighbouring regions in order to ensure unimpeded flow of people , goods and capital ;  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
The manufactured products which feature prominently in South-South trade of the dynamic East Asian countries include machinery and transport equipment ( ships and boats , electrical machinery , switchgears and parts ) , semi-manufactured products ( leather , knitted fabrics ) , resource-based manufactured products and a number of capital - and skill-intensive products ( office machines , automatic data processing equipment , television receivers , sound recorders , musical and optical equipment ) .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
The negative economic impact on the target State depends on a variety of factors , such as the magnitude and scope of the imposed coercive economic measures , the relative size of the target vis - - vis the sender State ( i.e . , the degree of economic autonomy of the target State ) , and the availability of alternative economic options for the target State in terms of access to markets , capital , technology and investments .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
The employment-generating capacity of growth can be enhanced by investing in the more labour-intensive sectors of the economy , especially agriculture ; by increasing investments in human capital , i.e . , basic education , primary health care , nutrition and population programmes ; and by reducing or removing distortions in relative factor prices that arise from a malfunctioning of the labour market or of the market for credit . 
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
NULLThe practices described in previous reports of arbitrarily rounding up children from the streets of the capital and major towns in northern Sudan and detaining them in special camps usually situated in remote areas continued to take place during the period under examination ( see E / CN . 4 / 1994 / 48 , paras . 89-94 , and E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 58 , paras .  NULL  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
Uganda intended to continue to work with its bilateral and multilateral development partners on innovative ways of mobilizing private productive capital and , to that end , had taken a number of domestic administrative and policy measures .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , i.e . of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Bearing in mind the aforementioned data , it is very obvious that the customary conditions of external debt regulation , that is , of re-emergence on the international capital market , can not be applied to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The bands of Taliban , under the direct control of the Pakistani Government , recently gathered at the outskirts of the capital Kabul and suffered repeated setbacks as a result of the crushing blows by the forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan , thus falling short of their heinous plans of taking over the city of Kabul .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
There is a heavy financial burden on the Government of Croatia to meet capital requirements in order to strengthen its infrastructure , as its current military-industrial complex is absorbing existing capital , thus preventing the investment necessary to achieve reconstruction and the restoration of infrastructure and other services .

of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
The agreements of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 , the rapid redefinition of economic groupings in the developed countries , and the ever more important role of private capital in the world economy , have created a new international environment in which the interests of Africa do not seem to have been taken into account , or in which they are even threatened or compromised . 
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
This commitment must be proven by the actual , unconditional implementation of all relevant agreements thus far concluded , to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights , including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State , with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
As a result of the heavy bombardment of the capital by the Taliban on 26 November 1995 , the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the escalation of fighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with the efforts of the United Nations Special Mission , then headed by Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri , aimed at achieving an immediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among the parties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer of power , to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptable to all Afghans .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
The process has therefore focused on completion of the internal free market for goods ; freeing the market for the movement of capital and investment and for the provision of services , including labour services , beginning with skilled labour ; and facilitating and encouraging factor movements through measures such as the harmonization and transferability of social security benefits and the avoidance of double taxation .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
The immediate strategy would include the assessment of national absorptive capacities , human and capital ; the definition of policy issues and drafting of national policies ; the restructuring and operation of key ministries for implementation of the defined policies ; the restoration of management systems and tools ( e.g . , personnel , audit , information ) ; the restoration and management of justice and public safety systems ; the retention and enlistment of professional human resources ; and the provision of crash training and retraining programmes .  
Improved access to private capital will be a key to success in providing EST opportunities for and improving the environmental performance of SMEs . Such companies have difficulties in remaining competitive in the rapidly expanding international marketplace .  
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
The Andean Presidents take note of the sustained and financially sound growth of the Andean Development Corporation in the international sphere , to the point where it has become the primary source of financing for the Andean countries , supporting physical integration projects , private-sector development , increased trade and the procurement of resources in capital markets .  
The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
Additionally , urgent social and economic priorities and severe capital constraints lead to low policy priority for any specific and additional mitigation or adaptation measures .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
The low national saving levels characteristic of the region 's economies , and the limited volume of investment resulting from such savings , will only allow them to grow at moderate rates ; therefore , unless savings and capital formation increase significantly , an accelerated economic growth rate can not be achieved .  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
The Special Fund was established by the General Assembly to provide new administrative and operational machinery to spearhead the enlargement of the scope of United Nations technical assistance and , in particular , to " . . . facilitate new capital investments of all types - private and public , national and international - by creating conditions which would make such investments either feasible for more effective " ( General Assembly resolution 1219 ( XII ) on the financing of economic development , dated 14 December 1957 ) .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
Moreover , while the refusal to allow Argentine citizens to reside in the Malvinas Islands dated back more than a century , the current policy barring the immigration of Argentines reinforced the long-time and persistent policy of denying the entry of Argentine residents and capital , in contrast to the international trend towards regional integration and the free movement of persons , including in conflict areas .  
Instead of descending by the east coast of Florida , they crossed the Florida peninsula to Key West and from there moved south , then west all of this within the region under United States air traffic control and then follow a straight line to the capital of Cuba .  
Their central objectives are to improve the economic position of members , whether individuals or enterprises , denied access to other banking institutions owing to their inability to offer sufficiently sound collateral ; to facilitate the continual recycling of cooperative capital into cooperative enterprise ; and to attract and manage capital obtained from outside the cooperative sector for use by individual cooperatives .  
In particular , minimum guarantee capital requirements are usually set on the basis of international standards and the " top end " of the market and often exceed considerably the value of premiums underwritten by a cooperative enterprise , given that these relate to the needs of members and , although critical to large numbers of persons , are modest in aggregate .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Reaffirming that investment in people is as vital as investment in capital , they called for paying special attention to sound basic education , skill formation and training , which is a lifelong undertaking , and improving the transition from school to work ;  
We in the OIC believe in speeding up the peace process and aim at putting it back on track with a view to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region and restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people , including their right to return , their right to self-determination and their right to build their own independent State on their national soil with Al-Quds al - Sharif as its capital , as well as a complete and speedy Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and occupied Lebanese territories .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
Urgent transmissions were made by the Special Rapporteur in cases that evinced a fear of imminent extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; these cases included death threats and fear of imminent execution of death sentences in contravention of the limitations on capital punishment set forth in the pertinent international instruments .  
As I stated in my address to the General Assembly during the general debate on 7 October 1996 , the Taliban mercenaries used some type of chemical or internationally banned weapon against the forces of the Ministry of Defence of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on 25 and 26 September 1996 in Lata-band , Band-i-Ghazi and Pul-i-Charkhi , battlefield areas situated east of the capital , where the resistance against them was firm and tenacious .  
The situation facing UNRWA in the last quarter of 1996 was untenable because its cash reserves had been depleted , and replenishment could only be effected by immediate payment of pledges already received ; further future deficits could no longer be absorbed because the Agency 's working capital would have been exhausted by the end of 1996 ;  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that the concept of development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional undertaking with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
The Heads of State called for the all-round development of trade and economic cooperation among the Turkish-speaking countries , the expansion of economic ties at various levels , the promotion of economic integration processes , the elimination of obstacles to joint trade and the establishment of a favourable legal regime for individuals and legal entities engaging in economic cooperation in order to create a single market for goods , services , capital and labour , without prejudice to their international obligations .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
In this regard , I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian people can count on the support of Ukraine which , with its considerable scientific and technological potential , stands ready to develop dynamic Ukrainian-Palestinian cooperation in the economic sphere , in particular in the sectors of housing and capital construction , water supply , education and training . 
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .  The leaders of one opposition party alleged that the Government was involved , while the press quoted foreign officials who implicated the Presidential Security Unit .  
Yemen reaffirms the need to move quickly towards a final settlement of the question of Palestine that will allow the Palestinian people to attain their legitimate rights , especially their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital , in keeping with international law and with the fundamental principles established at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo and subsequent agreements .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
" At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development has evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to that of a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . "  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
As indicated in the proclamation of the Supreme Council for the Defence of Afghanistan and duly reflected in our statement in the Security Council on 16 October 1996 , we strongly support an immediate and lasting ceasefire based upon the demilitarization of Kabul , the creation of a neutral police force in the capital and the establishment of a transitional Government of national unity encompassing all major Afghan sides .  
It highlights the dynamics of the market system and the effective coordination among basic economic actors in the framework of the system , with the State as the guiding and organizing power , the private sector as the prime catalyst of the capital market and the civil sector as the receiving body which is passively or positively influenced by the programmes .  
The issues to be discussed at the conference are set out in table 4 , and include methods for estimating capital stock , including the perpetual inventory method and direct survey methods ; concepts of capital for different purposes , such as balance sheets and productivity analysis ; issues for national balance sheets ; and extensions of the 1993 SNA capital boundary , such as computer software , mineral exploration and non-weapon military equipment .  
To that end , the Parties propose that , based on the electoral rolls , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , in consultation with political parties , should identify the places in which voting centres are to be set up within municipalities ; such places would be those which have large numbers of residents living a long way from the municipal capital and which are also accessible to party poll-watchers and electoral observers .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Whereas the Oslo , Washington and Cairo accords raised hopeful prospects for a just and lasting peaceful solution leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital , the new Israeli Government has embarked on a policy of colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories with the aim of creating situations of fait accompli on the ground .  
The apparent dissolution of nation states in the economic sphere , the apparent absence of barriers to capital and its uncontrolled international mobility are beginning to produce multiple reactions that can be observed with increasing frequency throughout the world .  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
At that time , the restructuring process was fully under way in both the private and public sectors , with the addition of new technologies and production , distribution and marketing processes , a significant increase in productivity resulting from the stability and with a change in the previous economy 's suffocating rules of the game , such as the cheapening of capital goods and the disappearance of inflation as an instantaneous means of relaxing labour costs .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Crimes against humanity require that certain capital crimes ( such as murder , extermination , imprisonment , torture , rape or persecution on political , racial and religious grounds ) are committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnical , racial or religious grounds .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
I wish to reiterate that , while we fully support the noble crusade to protect innocent civilians from anti-personnel landmines , a sweeping ban can not be a satisfactory answer for a country like the Republic of Korea , which faces the real and present risk of a recurrence of all-out war , and whose heavily populated capital is only 25 miles from the military demarcation line .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
The world has witnessed fundamental economic changes , such as the end of State control of economic life in many States , the withering away of numerous restraints on international trade , the easy transfer of capital and huge investments across the world .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Empirical evidence suggests that the countries that have been successful in sustaining capital inflows and long-term growth are those that have systematically upgraded their human capital and infrastructure and have promoted the continuous diversification or deepening of their domestic productive base .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Recognizing that , in general , large external capital movements are likely to be the market response to changes in expectations about domestic economic performance , the 1995 meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Interim Committee enhanced the IMF ability to monitor the economic policies of member countries and increase the transparency of national policies through improved and more timely provision of data .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Replace the first sentence with the following : At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition . 
The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
Indeed , FDI could negatively impact the development process , for example through TNC entry that inhibited the growth of domestic firms , through the repatriation of capital that aggravated balance-of-payments difficulties , or through social and environmental effects that impeded further economic development .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
To this end , recognizing the need for the gradual formation and development of a common economic area through the creation of conditions for the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour , the Parties shall take effective measures to coordinate a strategy for carrying out economic reforms , deepening economic integration on the basis of mutual advantage and harmonizing their economic legislation .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
Some of the concerns included the fact that economic policies were increasingly affected by the sentiments of a globalized financial market ; that greater openness also implied greater vulnerability to shocks in the international economic system ; and that heightened international economic competition and greater capital mobility weakened the bargaining position of labour , exerted downward pressure on labour standards and compromised the capacity of Governments to implement countervailing social policies .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
To achieve successful sales of public enterprises to the private sector , it is necessary to have a strong legislative framework , a high degree of capital market development and , in many cases , sufficient persons with the capacity and integrity to develop an effective regulatory system .  
When economic measures are employed for coercive purposes , instrumental economic effects are obviously their primary objective , which is achieved by restricting the target State 's access to markets , capital , technology and communications .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
It was also essential to promote an enabling international economic environment which ensured a minimum of stability to counter adverse effects arising from sudden movements in private capital flows .  
If the benefits of the free movement of capital flows are to be retained , the problems of financial instability and negative socio-economic effects of financial turmoil need to be addressed at the national and international levels .  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Despite the increasing role of private capital in development , official development assistance still played a critical and catalytic role in facilitating the development of the least developed countries .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
It lowered an average market interest rate for cooperatives based on capital investment , established the advisory and consultative councils with cooperative representation and advanced the autonomy of cooperatives .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
The problems of women in both urban and rural areas are such that women are not ready to become entrepreneurs because of insufficient start-up capital and managerial experience and an imperfect fiscal policy which does not suit everyone .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
The area , densely populated and containing the economic , social and cultural heart of the country , included the scenic capital Plymouth , located on the volcanos western flank .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
The representative of Cuba said that orthodox liberalization and deregulation policies had been catastrophic for the East Asian economies , which were as vulnerable to external factors as they were attractive for international capital flows . 
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
In its assessment of UNDP financial risks , the international consulting firm engaged by the Administrator advised that organizations such as UNDP , which do not have access to the capital markets nor the ability to borrow from banks to cover periodic cash flow needs , should maintain in liquidity the equivalent of 6 to 12 months ' expenditure as a prudent level .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
Mr . Petrella ( Argentina ) , referring to the current international economic crisis , said that the countries most affected by the crisis should understand that the promotion of growth and stability was contingent on the existence of open markets that would allow increased exports , sustained flows of investment capital , the promotion of domestic savings and the continuation of structural reforms .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
It is true that in certain outlying areas teachers salaries are below the minimum , because resources are insufficient to pay equal salaries throughout the country : this is one reason why there is a shortage of teaching staff , since they prefer to move to the capital in search of a better standard of living .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Such a mechanism should be written into the rules and conditions governing international financial contracts , in order to promote a better assessment of risks , eliminate irresponsible behaviour and reduce speculative short-term capital flows to emerging markets . 
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Contrary to the textbook model of large numbers of investors making careful independent judgements as to profitable opportunities , the capital markets are subject to bouts of herd behaviour that is , investors follow one another without forming their own judgements or expectations about individual economies .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
While the process of adapting from the television analog system to the digital standard has its financial implications in terms of capital investment in production equipment upgrade , the potential benefits for the effective dissemination of visual information are enormous .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
At the international level , a main objective of development assistance should be to support national efforts for sustained human capital formation .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country / sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;

Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
Continue to undertake detailed analyses of the financial and economic crisis , paying particular attention to the role of financial markets , and to present options to members and associate members which they may use , as appropriate , as inputs in the formulation of their relevant national policies , with a view to ensuring the attraction of a steady inflow of private capital ;  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
Our current population strategy , which was defined in the declaration on population policy adopted in April 1988 and elaborated in the eleventh orientation plan for economic and social development , was also inspired by the Dakar / Ngor Declaration adopted in the capital of Senegal during the Third African Population Conference .  
In a globalizing world , island nations such as ours , with limited natural resources and human capital , urgently need the support and assistance of the international community in overcoming our inherent vulnerabilities and realizing the hopes and aspirations of our peoples for achieving lasting and meaningful development .  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
Complementary policies are needed in a number of areas , for example in respect of supporting proper access to investment financing and venture capital ; facilitating access to new technologies and to match-making with foreign partners ; active labour market policies , including retraining for new technologies and activities ; unemployment insurance ; and the provision of basic infrastructure , industrial utilities and complementary services .  
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
However , the results in the field fell far short of the continents hopes and aspirations : for instance , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of sub-Saharan Africa had been decreasing at a rate of 0.8 per cent each year for the past 20 years and both official development assistance and private capital flows to African countries had proved extremely disappointing .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
The objectives were twofold : to collect comprehensive information on the stock of cross-border equities and long-term debt securities for use in the compilation or improvement of international investment position statistics ; and to allow the bilateral exchange of comparable data , in order to improve estimates of non-resident holdings of portfolio liabilities , as well as associated capital flows and investment income data .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Under this Act , foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impeding the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within the national territory .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
The four elements can be rendered dynamic by blending them with the idea of generating capital in four areas human , socio-cultural , economic and environmental in order to produce a proactive and wealth-creating approach to ageing , going beyond a mere reactive , or maintenance , stance .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
Policies for the prevention and the better management of financial crises have so far concentrated on particular areas , such as improved transparency , strengthened financial regulation , financial facilities better designed to support countries experiencing large capital outflows and currency collapses , and reduction of moral hazard problems in international lending and investment .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
San Marino intends to continue to voice its protest against capital punishment , firmly convinced that the abhorrent instrument of death consciously and legally inflicted by one human being on another can be considered neither a valid and effective answer to defend society nor a deterrent against the spreading of criminality .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
The key issues which need to be addressed if long-term capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Such perceptions of flaws in the existing Accord have led to pressure for regulatory changes , and underlie the new initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision for its reform . 16 The approach now envisaged rests on three pillars : minimum capital requirements , supervisory review of capital adequacy in accordance with specified qualitative principles , and market discipline based on the provision of reliable and timely information ( discussed in paras . 10-11 above ) . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
This presents a strong case for public capital investments in these countries supported by the international community , which is encouraged to consider assisting national efforts in the following often critical areas for transit transport : 
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
The Japanese Supreme Court had stated that capital punishment could be applied only when the criminals responsibility was extremely grave and the maximum penalty was unavoidable , taking into consideration , inter alia , the need for general prevention , the nature , motive and mode of the crime , the persistence and cruelty of the means of killing , the seriousness of the consequences , the number of persons killed , the feelings of the bereaved and the effect on society .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
Policy makers in other developing countries were encouraged by the international media to read the lesson of the Asian crisis , not as a cautionary tale about the dangers of opening capital markets without first developing the appropriate regulatory apparatus , but rather as evidence that State involvement in economic governance should be reduced . 
Although Haitis partners had been very understanding , the debt relief granted had proved insufficient to free up the capital needed to finance renewed economic growth .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows have presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The establishment of a single economic space and of the legal basis for a common market which shall guarantee the free movement of goods , services , capital and labour within the territories of the participating States , and equal conditions and guarantees for the activity of economic entities ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,

Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing the negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The current environment , driven by free market forces and unpredictable capital fluctuations had been favourable to countries which benefited from sound economic conditions , technology and capital but unfavourable to the majority of developing countries which were relatively uncompetitive and marginalized .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) : need to spread FDI more widely and to diversify private capital flows in order to reduce country sector concentration , strengthened contribution of FDI for domestic capacity-building and national development goals , role of South-South flows , reasons for marginalization of countries with a sound investment environment ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .

Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
We can not deny that uncontrolled market forces and unfettered short-term capital flows , to take but a few examples of globalization , have had devastating consequences on our economies , social cohesion , political stability and cultural identity in many cases for the worse rather than for the better . 
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
In the years to come , for economies with a relative average development , the subject of employment , which was included as a commitment in Copenhagen , will be essential to overcoming the link between poverty , low productivity and insufficient levels of skilled human capital .  
The Argentine Republic has promulgated an act establishing that foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impending the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within Argentine territory .  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
My country reaffirms its principled position that just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be based , first and foremost , on the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people , particularly their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital .  
As you said , Sir , a very great tragedy has occurred in Venezuela as a result because of the persistent rains that have fallen throughout the year in the central part of the country , which , on 16 December , led to massive flooding and mudslides in the central mountain range , affecting densely populated regions , particularly the central coastal regions near the capital city and where the country ' s main airport and port are located .  
From the point of view of labour rights , globalization was encouraging fragmentation and uncertainty ; as TNCs escaped national accountability , the poor were becoming increasingly disenfranchised , subsidies formerly granted to labour were being redirected to attract international capital , and the burden of taxes was shifting increasingly from capital to labour .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
It also creates the institution of family capital assets ( administered jointly by the spouses ) , a juridical statute for the protection of the immovable property which constitutes the familys principal residence and the movable goods contained therein , in order to preserve them , irrespective of which spouse owns them and which matrimonial regime is adopted .  
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
Thus , social policies designed to increase human capital in essence , health and education perform a vital role in ensuring that people have the assets required to gain access to a suitable position in the labour force , a decent wage and a reasonable level of well-being .  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In order to do so , airlines have to be attractive enough to be accepted as members of alliances , as partners in code-sharing and other cooperative arrangements , as enterprises that may be successfully privatized through national or foreign capital , or as companies capable of absorbing market solutions such as franchising or other arrangements with world-class airlines .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
In order to ensure that the developing and emerging States derived the maximum economic benefit from the new arrangements , the Commissions legal standards and guidance must take careful note of international financial and capital markets and foster a willingness to modify existing national laws .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital . 
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign.The Guide is not intended to provide advice on drafting agreements for the execution of privately financed infrastructure projects .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Market liberalization has led to spectacular , if not always consistent , growth , but it has also led to greater inequality and polarization within and among societies ; some regions have been mostly overlooked by private capital , and in all regions the swift withdrawal of investor confidence can lead to economic collapse and social distress .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The drop in aid contributions , especially the continuing decline in the share of net official development assistance in the gross domestic product of donor countries , had led to increased reliance on private loans on the international capital market .  
We say that the reasoning is unfair , being based on our high per capita gross domestic product , without taking into account either our ability to pay or the seriously disproportionate distribution of national income between capital , labour and taxation .  
As a matter of definition of our priorities , we would prefer to devote greater political capital , as well as greater material resources , to conflict prevention and to supporting countries with unstable social , civil and economic structures .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
We have recognized that economic strength , and therefore national strength , can not be preserved by pursuing autarkic policies or total reliance on generating capital investments internally .  
The continuing transfer of capital , technology and managerial and entrepreneurial skills from the rich to the poorer countries has become the classic justification of global multinational activity .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
The key issues that need to be addressed if longterm capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Equity demanded that the transfer of capital and technology to the emerging economies should be driven not only by the need for cheap and abundant labour , but by a desire to create viable and sustainable production and fair access to international markets .  
Strategic options being considered include fostering human capital development and the creation of permanent rural jobs through public investments geared to conserving and restoring natural resources ;  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
At an international level , coordinated taxation of international capital flows and support for universal human rights to minimal standards of living would also contribute to improving income distribution .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The decrease in official development assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , must be reversed , especially when it was not compensated for by major flows of private capital .  
First , trade liberalization and the demands of global capital markets and financial institutions have to varying extents constrained the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy options for social purposes , including employment and equity objectives .  
For the sixth survey , States were invited to list specific legal definitions of offences for which capital punishment could be imposed , according to whether the capital offences were considered ordinary or special .  
In an open system , national competitive economic purpose can sustain a pool of highly educated and flexible workers , an efficient infrastructure , sound money and a good quality of life so as to attract mobile financial and human capital .  
Provision was also made for modest increases in internal oversight and capital expenditures , as well as for special political missions whose mandates , though set to expire in 1999 , might be renewed for part or all of the coming biennium .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
That capital was represented by its countries potential for cooperation based on their common origins , longstanding bonds of solidarity and vision of a shared future .  
To some , it is an inevitable process driven by new technologies in electronic communication and transport , enabling information , persons , capital and goods to cross borders and reach the most remote corners of the globe at unprecedented speed .  
Under international law capital punishment shall not be applied to juvenile offenders , expectant or recent mothers , and those suffering from mental handicap or extremely limited mental capacity .  
First , rapidly rising income would allow domestic savings to rise , thereby increasing the amount of total investable resources ; and secondly , sustained growth would attract private capital as a substitute for official financing .  
The level and share of gross capital formation have grown in recent years , reflecting the unabated boom in private residential construction activity since 1994 .  
The Conference needs to focus on finding solutions to the inherent problem of weak productive capacities in LDCs through improved domestic policy frameworks , human capital development , traderelated capacity building and improved physical infrastructure .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Whether natural or caused by humans , crises often cross borders , draining resources away from essential public services , reducing development investments , and destroying physical , natural , institutional and social capital .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
Despite the modest growth achieved by many heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , debt restructuring continued to pose problems , and those countries remained exposed to the adverse developments in commodity prices , interest rates and private capital flows .  
Very harsh penalties were imposed on drug traffickers , ranging from life imprisonment to capital punishment , because drug trafficking was considered premeditated attempted homicide against innocent people .  
These countries thus bear special responsibility for supporting vigorous global economic growth and the expansion of international trade and in dampening abrupt changes in interest rates and in international capital markets .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
Although global ODA flows have been declining and they have become small relative to private flows of capital , it was reported that aid to the Pacific island developing countries has been maintained and will be required for some decades to come . 
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
The dynamic development of the financial system and the capital market demand reliable ground rules and strong regulatory frameworks in order to guarantee the stability of the relevant systems and the adequate protection of savers .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
The Supreme Council reviewed the bloody events that have taken place in the occupied Palestinian territories owing to the savage aggression , repressive measures and policies of closure and encirclement directed by Israel against a fraternal Palestinian people seeking the restoration of all of its legitimate rights , including its right to return and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
These measures included , in particular , improving the policy and operational framework for FDI , so as to put it on a par with best practice ; rationalizing fiscal incentives ; setting up a super agency to promote and facilitate investment ; fast-tracking privatization ; and implementing strategies for upgrading the human capital base .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
The Ministerial Council reviewed the Israeli practices of aggression against the Palestinian people , especially the escalation against towns , villages and camps , and the policy of closures and economic and political blockade being pursued by Israel against the fraternal Palestinian people demanding the restoration of its legitimate rights , including the right of return and its right to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
In that context , Pakistan had withdrawn all reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and had ratified the amendment to article 43 , paragraph 2 , on increasing the membership of the Committee on the Rights of the Child from 10 to 18 .  Pakistan had also promulgated a law which abolished capital punishment for juvenile offenders aged under 18 at the time of the crime ; it also prohibited keeping juvenile offenders in jail with adult prisoners or hardened criminals .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Condemn all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related forms of intolerance concerning economic , social and cultural rights and other related matters , including access to employment , government benefits , access to capital , credit , technology , education and vocational training , housing , health care , the environment , cultural activities , the protection of heritage , equal access to public services and other types of services , and national immigration policies ;  
Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Equally , it requires the definition of a clear and consistent set of public objectives , sound macroeconomic policies , efficient management of public revenue and expenditure , better allocation of resources and incentives to prevent capital flight and to encourage private savings and tax reforms , and a solid framework to implement stabilization or economic reform programmes .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
An outcome of increased volatility of international financial conditions and frequent crises in emerging markets is the tendency to build up reserves as a safeguard against a rapid exit of capital and speculative attack on currencies . 
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
Structural adjustment programmes have not had the expected outcome , and the Trade and Development Board , while welcoming the new emphasis of such programmes on poverty reduction , encourages continued attention to be paid to external factors as well as to shortcomings of domestic markets and enterprises , human capital and physical infrastructure , institutions and income distribution . 
The application of such laws , which are intended to restrict the access of the targeted sovereign States and Members of the United Nations to markets , capital , technology and investment in order to exert pressure upon them to change their political and economic orientation is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law , the Charter of the United Nations and numerous other resolutions of the General Assembly .
