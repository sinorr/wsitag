Upon joining the missile company , Li Bin , with an education level of junior middle school only , felt completely at a loss when he faced all kinds of complicated pictures about structure of missiles , theories of constructing missiles , original elements of electrical equipment , and the dazzling red , blue , and green buttons of missile launching .  
Not discouraged , Li Bin made use of the supplementary education courses sponsored by the detachment , and learned from the instructors with a receptive mind .  He studied intensively the professional knowledge , and made laborious efforts to finish within a short period of three years the teaching material of 12 courses , including " fundamentals of electrical equipment , " the " study of missile launching , " and others .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
China 's household electrical appliance industry digested and absorbed foreign technology brought in through a variety of ways - - such as engaging in cooperative production with foreign name-brand enterprises and importing key installations as well as packages of technology and production lines - - and made innovations to greatly narrow the gap between Chinese and advanced international levels , thereby quickening the pace of development .  
However , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .  To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
6 .  Find Market Prestige Through Quality After-Sales Service Household electrical appliances are expensive durable consumer goods ; only part of an appliance is sold when it leaves a store , as a sale in its true meaning is completed only when it is fully installed and fit for safe usage .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
He said : Over the last few years , although the home electrical appliance industry , including the color television industry , has faced fierce competitions and experienced many price wars and price cuttings , and the price signal has indicated that supply of home electrical appliance has seriously outstripped market demand , the production capacity of home electrical appliance has not shrunk - - as a matter of fact , it has increased to some degree .  Moreover , not many enterprises have been eliminated .  The market competition mechanism has not played a noticeable role .  
The main cause is the intervention of local protectionism and other non-market factors , which have enabled some home electrical appliance enterprises which have lost their competitiveness and survival ability to survive and keep on operating under the protective umbrella of administrative intervention , which , in turn , has prevented resources that have been excessively invested in this industry from smoothly withdrawing from competition .  
- - Exemption of bidding : For exhibited products from outside the territory , which will be left behind for purchase , they will be entitled to the treatment of " exemption of international biddings for imported mechanical and electrical engineering products , " provided that they are registered and coordinated in advance with the organizing committee .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .

A large quantity of unmanifested cargoes included an optical disc production machinery , about 400 000 VCDs , raw plastic , medical equipment , fax machines , assorted electrical and computer components , and assorted vehicle parts were found concealed and beneath the scrap metal . 
Precision machinery and instruments , electronic , optical , metal , plastic , electrical , chemical and rubber products , machinery , cosmetics , leather products , toys , yachts and mobile homes , garments , medical instruments and appliances , sporting goods , musical instruments , educational materials and communications equipment are the major products of factories in the EPZs .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
TSC imported a complete hothouse facility from the Netherlands , but within half a year an intense electrical storm had knocked out the computer that controlled the temperature . They sought help from Holland , but were shocked when their counterpart asked for NT $ 500,000 . This fortified their determination to " develop a greenhouse suited to Taiwan , " states Center director Hu Chun-kwang .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
He once carried out a rather funny " group therapy , " for which he filled a large bucket with electrical conductors like glass , water , and magnetized iron . Amid them he erected an iron bar , upon which was tied a needle . He then pulled out a lot of wire and guided the magnetic flux to the sick areas of his patients ' bodies . The patients held onto the wire while sitting in a circle around the bucket .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
The story of the Sun brothers surviving in the collapsed Tunghsing building in Taipei City thanks to a big old refrigerator was widely reported , but few people are aware that in the stricken areas many of the dead were crushed by falling heavy furniture and electrical appliances , or were trapped by overturned furniture which blocked their escape routes .  
After the job of damage appraisal was finished , the association established a " home repair task force . " A lot of families were living in basically safe structures that were nevertheless in need of repairs . The association lent its assistance free of charge to families lacking the resources to undertake such repairs on their own . They reinforced beams and posts , and repaired damaged walls , plumbing , and electrical wiring .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
Liu was originally trained as an electrical engineer , and in fact served as such for the greater part of his life . He took up the brush during middle age and went on to develop a highly personal style . Later in life , Liu crossed the border into the field of anthropology , making bold expeditions to Africa , Borneo , Latin America , and Oceania . He bounced back and forth between myriad pursuits , and was able to achieve impressive results in each field .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
Michelle Sung Ing / tr . by Michael Hill Lighthouses are built to guide ships at sea , and many are built on barren , uninhabited islands that are normally hardly visited at all , other than by a few fishermen who come during the fishing season . Lighthouse keepers rely completely on periodic deliveries of food , water , and daily necessities from supply boats , and thus all lighthouse keepers are trained to be versatile , and must take care of all housing maintenance , including electrical work , metal work , woodworking , and painting .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
The manufactured products which feature prominently in South-South trade of the dynamic East Asian countries include machinery and transport equipment ( ships and boats , electrical machinery , switchgears and parts ) , semi-manufactured products ( leather , knitted fabrics ) , resource-based manufactured products and a number of capital - and skill-intensive products ( office machines , automatic data processing equipment , television receivers , sound recorders , musical and optical equipment ) .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
Additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which included but were not limited to electrical , mechanical and special systems requirements , namely , uninterrupted power supply , building automated control and anti-intrusion security ;  
The aim is to facilitate farming activities for more than 20,000 rural families , to demine energy and transport infrastructures and to destroy the 85,000 mines that are still scattered across our national territory in various locations , including around high-tension pylons , electrical substations , bridges , relay stations and areas with radio aerials along the northern and southern borders .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .  Some of these changes were the result of modified user requirements , or for greater operational efficiency , and to take advantage of changes in technology since the original design was drawn , for example innovations in fibre optics .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
The future holds the prospect that ITs will enable us to transport electrical binary bits or pulses ( 0 s and 1 s ) instead of moving and bashing atoms and thus accurately simulate a nuclear explosion , just as we can reconstruct an analogue signal from a sampled ( quantized and coded ) series of bits cheaply and safely .  
The total savings of $ 2,836,500 with respect to contractual services , security services , medical treatment and services , claims and adjustment , medical supplies , sanitation and cleaning materials , subscription , operational maps and general stores were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $ 1,229,300 with respect to data-processing services , official hospitality , miscellaneous services , stationery and office supplies , electrical supplies and field defence stores .  
Upon joining the missile company , Li Bin , with an education level of junior middle school only , felt completely at a loss when he faced all kinds of complicated pictures about structure of missiles , theories of constructing missiles , original elements of electrical equipment , and the dazzling red , blue , and green buttons of missile launching .  
Not discouraged , Li Bin made use of the supplementary education courses sponsored by the detachment , and learned from the instructors with a receptive mind .  He studied intensively the professional knowledge , and made laborious efforts to finish within a short period of three years the teaching material of 12 courses , including " fundamentals of electrical equipment , " the " study of missile launching , " and others .  
In 1999 the average charge per kilowatt of electricity in the rural areas fell by 0.1 yuan , and as a result the peasants paid a total of 23-billion yuan less for their electricity ; many peasants who could not afford electricity in the past have now happily installed color TV and VCD players , and sales of domestic electrical appliances have hotted up in some rural areas .  
At the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new-style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .  The quality of China 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .  
China 's household electrical appliance industry digested and absorbed foreign technology brought in through a variety of ways - - such as engaging in cooperative production with foreign name-brand enterprises and importing key installations as well as packages of technology and production lines - - and made innovations to greatly narrow the gap between Chinese and advanced international levels , thereby quickening the pace of development .  
However , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .  To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
6 .  Find Market Prestige Through Quality After-Sales Service Household electrical appliances are expensive durable consumer goods ; only part of an appliance is sold when it leaves a store , as a sale in its true meaning is completed only when it is fully installed and fit for safe usage .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
Competition of this kind is a means to stimulate consumption as well as a necessary market mechanism to save efficient enterprises and eliminate the poor ones .  The reason why China 's home electrical appliance enterprises , such as color televisions , refrigerators , and washing machine enterprises , have been able to grab an overwhelmingly large domestic market share and in turn enter international markets is just the fierce price competitions a few years ago .  
He said : Over the last few years , although the home electrical appliance industry , including the color television industry , has faced fierce competitions and experienced many price wars and price cuttings , and the price signal has indicated that supply of home electrical appliance has seriously outstripped market demand , the production capacity of home electrical appliance has not shrunk - - as a matter of fact , it has increased to some degree .  Moreover , not many enterprises have been eliminated .  The market competition mechanism has not played a noticeable role .  
The main cause is the intervention of local protectionism and other non-market factors , which have enabled some home electrical appliance enterprises which have lost their competitiveness and survival ability to survive and keep on operating under the protective umbrella of administrative intervention , which , in turn , has prevented resources that have been excessively invested in this industry from smoothly withdrawing from competition .  
- - Exemption of bidding : For exhibited products from outside the territory , which will be left behind for purchase , they will be entitled to the treatment of " exemption of international biddings for imported mechanical and electrical engineering products , " provided that they are registered and coordinated in advance with the organizing committee .  
A number of village party branches and villagers ' committees led the masses in building roads , drawing water , putting up electrical poles , and running schools one after another .  As a result , the healthy atmosphere has grown and evil tendencies have declined in the rural areas , the ugly phenomena such as " pornography , gambling , and drug-taking " and feudal superstition have been considerably reduced , and the " dirty , chaotic , and poor " appearance of the villages has been changed .  
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation demanded that increasing export by every possible means should be regarded as a top priority in the development of China 's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the second half of this year , and that it is necessary to promote the export of mechanical and electrical products , textiles , and other traditional staple commodities and the export of new hi-tech products and agricultural products , and give impetus to export by major exporters and foreign-invested enterprises .  
The Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics ( SIOFM ) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) announced today that 15 times ten to the 12th power watts ( 15 terawatts ) of electrical power in an ultra-fast duration of 35 timesone over a quadrillion second ( 35 femtoseconds ) has been produced from an optical platform of less than 10 square meters .  This level of intensity is equivalent to several times the total power of the world 's overall electric network .

A large quantity of unmanifested cargoes included an optical disc production machinery , about 400 000 VCDs , raw plastic , medical equipment , fax machines , assorted electrical and computer components , and assorted vehicle parts were found concealed and beneath the scrap metal . 
Precision machinery and instruments , electronic , optical , metal , plastic , electrical , chemical and rubber products , machinery , cosmetics , leather products , toys , yachts and mobile homes , garments , medical instruments and appliances , sporting goods , musical instruments , educational materials and communications equipment are the major products of factories in the EPZs .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
Liu Yu-shan , secretory-general of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , notes that right now the projects in which the Europeans , Americans , and Japanese are most interested are the high-tech ones . The main ones can be categorized as transportation ( the mass rapid transit system and the high-speed railroad ) , energy ( the fourth nuclear power and electrical generators ) , environmental protection ( incinerators ) , and the modernization of the postal and telecommunications networks .  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
TSC imported a complete hothouse facility from the Netherlands , but within half a year an intense electrical storm had knocked out the computer that controlled the temperature . They sought help from Holland , but were shocked when their counterpart asked for NT $ 500,000 . This fortified their determination to " develop a greenhouse suited to Taiwan , " states Center director Hu Chun-kwang .  
That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
He once carried out a rather funny " group therapy , " for which he filled a large bucket with electrical conductors like glass , water , and magnetized iron . Amid them he erected an iron bar , upon which was tied a needle . He then pulled out a lot of wire and guided the magnetic flux to the sick areas of his patients ' bodies . The patients held onto the wire while sitting in a circle around the bucket .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
The story of the Sun brothers surviving in the collapsed Tunghsing building in Taipei City thanks to a big old refrigerator was widely reported , but few people are aware that in the stricken areas many of the dead were crushed by falling heavy furniture and electrical appliances , or were trapped by overturned furniture which blocked their escape routes .  
After the job of damage appraisal was finished , the association established a " home repair task force . " A lot of families were living in basically safe structures that were nevertheless in need of repairs . The association lent its assistance free of charge to families lacking the resources to undertake such repairs on their own . They reinforced beams and posts , and repaired damaged walls , plumbing , and electrical wiring .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
Liu was originally trained as an electrical engineer , and in fact served as such for the greater part of his life . He took up the brush during middle age and went on to develop a highly personal style . Later in life , Liu crossed the border into the field of anthropology , making bold expeditions to Africa , Borneo , Latin America , and Oceania . He bounced back and forth between myriad pursuits , and was able to achieve impressive results in each field .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
Michelle Sung Ing / tr . by Michael Hill Lighthouses are built to guide ships at sea , and many are built on barren , uninhabited islands that are normally hardly visited at all , other than by a few fishermen who come during the fishing season . Lighthouse keepers rely completely on periodic deliveries of food , water , and daily necessities from supply boats , and thus all lighthouse keepers are trained to be versatile , and must take care of all housing maintenance , including electrical work , metal work , woodworking , and painting .  
Nita Ing says that construction on the high-speed rail project is 60% complete . This includes the civil engineering work , which is 100% complete . Work on train stations , tracks , maintenance bases and electronic , electrical and mechanical systems is well underway . Ing is confident that the entire project will be completed on schedule by the end of next year .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
The manufactured products which feature prominently in South-South trade of the dynamic East Asian countries include machinery and transport equipment ( ships and boats , electrical machinery , switchgears and parts ) , semi-manufactured products ( leather , knitted fabrics ) , resource-based manufactured products and a number of capital - and skill-intensive products ( office machines , automatic data processing equipment , television receivers , sound recorders , musical and optical equipment ) .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
Additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which included but were not limited to electrical , mechanical and special systems requirements , namely , uninterrupted power supply , building automated control and anti-intrusion security ;  
The aim is to facilitate farming activities for more than 20,000 rural families , to demine energy and transport infrastructures and to destroy the 85,000 mines that are still scattered across our national territory in various locations , including around high-tension pylons , electrical substations , bridges , relay stations and areas with radio aerials along the northern and southern borders .  
At police stations , the forms of torture and ill-treatment reported include kicking ; beating ; application of electric shocks by means of batons or small electrical generators ; the use of self-tightening handcuffs ; deprivation of food ; exposure to alternating extremes of hot and cold temperatures ; enforced standing in difficult positions ; enforced standing in cold water ; prolonged shackling of detainees spread-eagled to a wall ; placing of heated objects on the skin ; and striking with iron rods on the joints or hands .  
During the same period , in 1994 , additional work and project changes were requested by ECA , which , inter alia , included electrical , mechanical and special system requirements such as additional and uninterruptible power supply , building automated control system and anti-intrusion security .  Some of these changes were the result of modified user requirements , or for greater operational efficiency , and to take advantage of changes in technology since the original design was drawn , for example innovations in fibre optics .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
The future holds the prospect that ITs will enable us to transport electrical binary bits or pulses ( 0 s and 1 s ) instead of moving and bashing atoms and thus accurately simulate a nuclear explosion , just as we can reconstruct an analogue signal from a sampled ( quantized and coded ) series of bits cheaply and safely .  
The total savings of $ 2,836,500 with respect to contractual services , security services , medical treatment and services , claims and adjustment , medical supplies , sanitation and cleaning materials , subscription , operational maps and general stores were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $ 1,229,300 with respect to data-processing services , official hospitality , miscellaneous services , stationery and office supplies , electrical supplies and field defence stores .
