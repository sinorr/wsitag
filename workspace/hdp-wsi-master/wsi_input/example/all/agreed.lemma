The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
However , in the course of their work during the five-day plenary session in April 1999 , members of the Committee quickly became aware that their work was seriously handicapped by the lack of prior preliminary discussions among themselves ( including on how to address the large theme assigned by the Economic and Social Council ) , of specialized inputs for the Committees consideration and of adequate time during the plenary session for analysis and formulation of agreed recommendations .  
As explained above ( para . 131 ) , the application of the agreed set of criteria for the designation of least developed countries goes beyond statistical calculations particularly in otherwise marginal cases to the careful assessment both of the numerical results and of supplementary information to be collected , especially a set of vulnerability profiles .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .

From what the Special Rapporteur was able to determine , it may be said that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has been complying with these agreements , although there has been a pronounced delay in their implementation , a matter which , as already stated , is most disturbing inasmuch as the measures agreed are of the greatest importance for achieving a climate of dtente with sufficient safeguards before the legislative elections due to be held on a date not yet fixed in 1999 .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
This study revealed that the amount of support ordered by judges or agreed to by the parties is extremely low and that the whole range of tools offered by the law for ensuring that the amount is fair are underused ( for example , petitioning for interim support , approaching the grandparents when the amount paid by the father is insufficient and having support payments withheld by the employer of the liable party ) and that there is a tendency for the liable party to default on payments .  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Mr . Theuermann ( Austria ) said that he had understood , during the consultations held with the sponsors of the draft resolution , that paragraph 4 had been amended and that after the words fundamental human rights , it had been agreed to add the phrase and reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development .  
The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
This overview explains why Canada remains so engaged to fully and urgently observing the objective unanimously agreed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , that is , the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons . . . .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
The subprogramme will give the necessary attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainability , including the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional resources to developing countries , changing production and consumption patterns and mechanisms for technology transfer as mutually agreed to address poverty as an overriding issue .

It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
The social situation was further worsened by the reduction in public expenditures required to meet budget deficit parameters agreed with multilateral financial institutions .

Establishing new democratic relations in Serbia as soon as possible , by organizing free and fair elections , at the municipal level as well as for Serbia , verified by international organizations , with election conditions to be agreed on and accepted by all ;  
The chairpersons also agreed that a formal agenda for that meeting should be prepared sufficiently in advance to enable all participants to engage in a focused exchange on select key issues , and encouraged States parties to suggest topics for it .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
Rather , it is an ongoing , agreed , systematic and comprehensive participatory process that must become part of the dynamic of national construction in various areas political , economic , social and cultural .  
He therefore agreed with the view of the Special Rapporteur , expressed in paragraph 111 , that the principle of an effective and genuine link should not be seen as a rule of customary international law in cases not involving dual or plural nationality .  
While all States agreed that the environment must be protected and that potentially harmful activities must be regulated , environmental standards and national financial capacities varied and it would be difficult to establish a minimum standard of conduct .  
The panel agreed that on the institutionalization of crimes , local guilty parties would be held accountable by the people but the double crime is when people are robbed once by corrupt officials and then again when they are forced to repay the debts . 
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
Respecting the legislative and parliamentary constraints faced by developed countries is crucial ; many delegates agreed with the recommendation calling for a global effort to mobilize support among local citizens , non-governmental organizations and private sector partners for achieving the Millennium Summit goals .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
The Supreme Council agreed that nationals of GCC countries employed in the civil service of any member State should , while serving , be treated in the same manner as nationals of the State to which they are assigned , in accordance with the provisions set forth in the decision of the ministers responsible for central civil service agencies in the GCC countries .  
It was also agreed that , in view of the concerns expressed about whether the draft convention should include private international law rules dealing with priority issues with respect to types of asset that were not receivables and about which the appropriate applicable law should be , and the issues identified for further refinement , the proposed text should be retained within square brackets .  
Furthermore , it was agreed that , in order to provide an alternative presentation of the matters covered in paragraph 1 whereby paragraph 1 ( a ) would deal with priority in respect of receivables and paragraph 1 ( b ) would deal with priority in proceeds , paragraph 1 ( a ) ( ii ) should be moved to paragraph 1 ( b ) and be placed within separate square brackets , pending determination by the Commission of the placement of that provision .  
Before entering into a discussion of the provisions of chapter V , the Working Group considered the general usefulness of chapter V and its scope as reflected in draft article 1 , paragraph 4 , which appeared within square brackets pending final determination of the scope or the purpose of chapter V . It was generally agreed that chapter V was useful for States that did not have any rules on the law applicable to assignment-related issues or did not have adequate rules on all such issues . 
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
Accordingly , the Executive Committee agreed to entrust their regional managers with the effective monitoring of CCAs and UNDAFs in their respective regions and to task them proactively to provide the necessary support to their country representatives , to contribute to and use the results of the CCA / UNDAF Learning Network on a systematic basis and to continue their joint inter-agency meetings and reports to the Executive Committee either on a quarterly or a biannual basis .  
We stress the importance of a G-77 / G-8 dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership as an essential mechanism for the discussion of emerging and urgent issues relevant to the strengthening of a global partnership for development to further strengthen the efforts of the international community with respect to adopting a positive agenda and addressing development issues of international concern , including the implementation of the agreed commitments and outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
The Subcommittee agreed that the draft Unidroit convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property represented an important initiative that was of considerable interest to member States .  
The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
To appeal to the United States of America to engage in a direct dialogue on equal terms with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , in order to discuss and resolve whatever factors may be preventing the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries , and allow the Lockerbie case to take its legal and judicial course , as required by the nature of the dispute and as agreed by all parties , free from pressures of any kind ;  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
The meeting had been inconclusive , however , and the Personal Envoy had called upon the parties to come forward at a meeting to be held in June , with concrete solutions to the multiple problems of the settlement plan that the parties could agree to , or else be prepared to consider and discuss other ways to achieve an early , durable and agreed resolution of their dispute over Western Sahara .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the post-Phase V Working Group on reformed procedures for determining reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment had validated the methodology and agreed on revised reimbursement rates for major equipment , self-sustainment rates for some special cases , new categories of major equipment , generic reimbursement for painting jobs of major equipment and new rates for medical services .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
UNFPA agreed to organize the eighth Round Table on Communication for Development , scheduled to take place from 26 to 29 November 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua , and proposed the following three central issues : evaluating the information programmes designed to halt the HIV / AIDS pandemic ; development of methodologies to evaluate current communication programmes ; and using community radio to reach the disadvantaged .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
The Special Adviser attended the seventh annual Congress of the International Ombudsperson Institute held in Durban , South Africa , from 30 October to 2 November 2000 , where the participating Ombudspersons and national institutions agreed that living in a society that pursues good governance practices is a basic human right .  59 .  An increasing number of national institutions take the opportunity of addressing the Commission on Human Rights in its annual sessions .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
Development partners agreed to effectively implement the enhanced HIPC Initiative and provide adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and provide new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
They agreed that it was vital to address the problem in a comprehensive , integrated , sustainable and efficient manner , and recommended a series of practical actions to be taken by OAU member States at the national and regional levels .  
As regards record-keeping , views were expressed that there was also a need to establish agreed minimum standards ; it was noted that national systems for record-keeping could vary according to differing national circumstances and regulatory arrangements , provided that national authorities ensured that the systems in their country were sufficient to enable individual arms to be identified and traced in a timely and reliable manner .  
That is why we fully agreed with the Chilean representative when , on behalf of the countries of the Rio Group , he stated the firm conviction that measures should be adopted that will contribute to an effective and gradual limitation and monitoring of defence costs in the region , ultimately ensuring the availability of more resources for the social and economic development of our peoples .  
Calls upon all relevant bodies , agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental , regional and subregional organizations , within their continuing mandated activities , to continue to address the issue of international migration and development and to provide appropriate support for interregional , regional and subregional processes and activities on international migration and development , with a view to integrating migration issues in a more coherent way within the broader context of the implementation of agreed economic and social development programmes ;  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
The various measures agreed on , particularly the creation at the national , regional and international levels of strategies and plans of action , required widespread support to the countries involved in the struggle as well as the promotion at the international level of legal cooperation and strengthening of cross-border controls .  
While reaffirming its importance for the purpose of making legislators aware of the implications of their policy choices in the field of privately financed infrastructure , the Working Group agreed that the recommendation had an educational rather than a prescriptive character and therefore was not suitable to be transformed into a model legislative provision .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Accordingly , it was agreed that it would be useful to draft a model legislative provision reflecting the recommendation , for the purpose of either eliminating existing legal obstacles or to overcoming possible contrary practices of judicial or administrative authorities .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , [ 3 ] the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Invites the relevant international organizations to take appropriate steps , consistent with the principle of efficient and effective procurement and with the agreed measures for procurement reform , in order to broaden access for interested local and regional vendors and to facilitate their participation in the international assistance efforts for reconstruction , recovery and development of the region ;  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system , the private sector and civil society to provide the necessary financial resources to assist national Governments in their efforts to meet the development targets and benchmarks agreed upon in the World Summit for Social Development , the Fourth World Conference on Women , the International Conference on Population and Development , the twenty-third and twenty-fourth special sessions of the General Assembly and other relevant United Nations conferences and summits ;  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
Stresses the importance of facilitating access to and transfer of knowledge and technology on concessional , preferential and favourable terms to the developing countries , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights and the special needs of developing countries , with the objective of enhancing their technological capacities , capabilities , productivity and competitiveness in the world market ;  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system , the private sector and civil society to provide the necessary financial resources to assist national Governments in their efforts to meet the development targets and benchmarks agreed upon at the World Summit for Social Development , the Fourth World Conference on Women , the International Conference on Population and Development , the twenty-third and twenty-fourth special sessions of the General Assembly and other relevant United Nations conferences and summits ;  
Reiterates the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimensions , where appropriate , in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , and encourages the resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure the greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in the common country assessment and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , as appropriate ;  
Stresses the importance of facilitating access to and transfer of knowledge and technology on concessional , preferential and favourable terms to the developing countries , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights and the special needs of developing countries , with the objective of enhancing their technological capacities , capabilities , productivity and competitiveness in the world market ;

Thus , as was so well pointed out by the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999 , the international community has a deciding role to play in supporting action to eliminate poverty , promote productive employment , achieve gender equality and mobilize new and additional financial resources in order to guarantee the implementation of the agreed objectives of social development .  
Conflicts will continue as long as the North continues to impose an imperfect and environmentally and economically unsustainable political model that may , perhaps , work in the North a model reached after centuries of absolute monarchies , without free or just elections , without universal suffrage , without women having the vote , without eight-hour work days , without what today is called good governance , though this concept has yet to be defined or agreed on by anybody .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
While remaining devoted to our own language , culture and traditions , we are fully aware of the importance of the international community ' s making itself understood and of its communicating through the rich linguistic resources that the peoples of our world possess ; and this can be done rationally only on an agreed basis , as established in Article 111 of the United Nations Charter .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
In this context , the international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect the intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
However , in the course of their work during the five-day plenary session in April 1999 , members of the Committee quickly became aware that their work was seriously handicapped by the lack of prior preliminary discussions among themselves ( including on how to address the large theme assigned by the Economic and Social Council ) , of specialized inputs for the Committees consideration and of adequate time during the plenary session for analysis and formulation of agreed recommendations .  
As explained above ( para . 131 ) , the application of the agreed set of criteria for the designation of least developed countries goes beyond statistical calculations particularly in otherwise marginal cases to the careful assessment both of the numerical results and of supplementary information to be collected , especially a set of vulnerability profiles .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
From what the Special Rapporteur was able to determine , it may be said that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has been complying with these agreements , although there has been a pronounced delay in their implementation , a matter which , as already stated , is most disturbing inasmuch as the measures agreed are of the greatest importance for achieving a climate of dtente with sufficient safeguards before the legislative elections due to be held on a date not yet fixed in 1999 .  
In 1995 , Act No . 19 , 381 was published ; the Act increased some of the entitlements for male and female participants and regulated such areas as the authority of the Superintendency ; participants right to claim any surplus between their legal contribution and the cost of their agreed health plans ; increased access of participants to information ; regulation of coverage limits ; and exclusions .  
This study revealed that the amount of support ordered by judges or agreed to by the parties is extremely low and that the whole range of tools offered by the law for ensuring that the amount is fair are underused ( for example , petitioning for interim support , approaching the grandparents when the amount paid by the father is insufficient and having support payments withheld by the employer of the liable party ) and that there is a tendency for the liable party to default on payments .  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Mr . Theuermann ( Austria ) said that he had understood , during the consultations held with the sponsors of the draft resolution , that paragraph 4 had been amended and that after the words fundamental human rights , it had been agreed to add the phrase and reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development .  
The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
This overview explains why Canada remains so engaged to fully and urgently observing the objective unanimously agreed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , that is , the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons . . . .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
The subprogramme will give the necessary attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainability , including the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional resources to developing countries , changing production and consumption patterns and mechanisms for technology transfer as mutually agreed to address poverty as an overriding issue .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
In the Agreement regarding security ( ibid . , annex III ) , its signatories agreed that a secure environment devoid of violence or other forms of intimidation was a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair ballot in East Timor , and further , that the absolute neutrality of the Indonesian Armed Forces ( TNI ) and the Indonesian police was essential in this regard .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
With regard to possible future work on insolvency law , his delegation agreed with the view that strong insolvency and debtor-creditor regimes were important for preventing or limiting financial crises and promoting rapid and orderly recovery from excessive indebtedness .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
The Conference agreed that an acceptable definition of the concept of sustainable development in agriculture was one in which the development satisfied the following conditions : ( a ) that it lead to the production of sufficient food ; ( b ) that it did not harm the environment ; ( c ) that it was acceptable to society ; ( d ) that it was an economically viable approach ; and ( e ) that it met the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet theirs .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 122-125 ) , regulatory agencies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
Every State had a sovereign right to enact national legislation that reflected the cultural values and imperatives of the society concerned , ensuring the security and safety of individuals in accordance with internationally agreed principles relating to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
In the end , the Group of 77 agreed that globalization is a process which can be uneven and unpredictable , but that if it is properly harnessed and managed , the foundations for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels can be laid . 
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification . 
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
The Group was agreed that , while a mathematical approach was inappropriate , it was reasonable to expect that the accepted equal importance of both sets of rights should find a broad reflection in the United Nations human rights machinery .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
The social situation was further worsened by the reduction in public expenditures required to meet budget deficit parameters agreed with multilateral financial institutions .  
A contrary view was that , if the parties agreed to use a higher standard than that approved by applicable law ( assuming applicable law to reflect the terms of article 7 of the Model Law ) , it would not be covered by the current draft of article 3 .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
Sweden has a strong commitment to continued international development cooperation , and we are among those four countries that meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
She agreed with the importance the Executive Board attached to regular , open and analytic reporting , and stressed that UNFPA was equally committed to seeing results but recognized the need to be realistic in terms of the existing data .  
However , it was agreed that strong international support measures , including financial , technical and commercial assistance , are of critical importance in influencing the future growth and development of LDCs .  
Like the CCA , it is countrydriven , prepared with the broad participation of civil society , key donors and other relevant international finance institutions , and linked to agreed international development goals .  
Establishing new democratic relations in Serbia as soon as possible , by organizing free and fair elections , at the municipal level as well as for Serbia , verified by international organizations , with election conditions to be agreed on and accepted by all ;  
The chairpersons also agreed that a formal agenda for that meeting should be prepared sufficiently in advance to enable all participants to engage in a focused exchange on select key issues , and encouraged States parties to suggest topics for it .  
It is sad to note that flows of official development assistance have fallen to an alltime low of 0.2 per cent , far from the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries .  
Rather , it is an ongoing , agreed , systematic and comprehensive participatory process that must become part of the dynamic of national construction in various areas political , economic , social and cultural .  
He therefore agreed with the view of the Special Rapporteur , expressed in paragraph 111 , that the principle of an effective and genuine link should not be seen as a rule of customary international law in cases not involving dual or plural nationality .  
While all States agreed that the environment must be protected and that potentially harmful activities must be regulated , environmental standards and national financial capacities varied and it would be difficult to establish a minimum standard of conduct .  
The panel agreed that on the institutionalization of crimes , local guilty parties would be held accountable by the people but the double crime is when people are robbed once by corrupt officials and then again when they are forced to repay the debts . 
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
Respecting the legislative and parliamentary constraints faced by developed countries is crucial ; many delegates agreed with the recommendation calling for a global effort to mobilize support among local citizens , non-governmental organizations and private sector partners for achieving the Millennium Summit goals .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
Mexico will continue encouraging the adoption of measures aimed at consolidating the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , including the universalization and full validity of the various international treaties on the matter , as well as the negotiation of new bilateral and multilateral agreements whose objective is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , as a step towards the agreed goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
The Supreme Council agreed that nationals of GCC countries employed in the civil service of any member State should , while serving , be treated in the same manner as nationals of the State to which they are assigned , in accordance with the provisions set forth in the decision of the ministers responsible for central civil service agencies in the GCC countries .  
It was also agreed that , in view of the concerns expressed about whether the draft convention should include private international law rules dealing with priority issues with respect to types of asset that were not receivables and about which the appropriate applicable law should be , and the issues identified for further refinement , the proposed text should be retained within square brackets .  
Furthermore , it was agreed that , in order to provide an alternative presentation of the matters covered in paragraph 1 whereby paragraph 1 ( a ) would deal with priority in respect of receivables and paragraph 1 ( b ) would deal with priority in proceeds , paragraph 1 ( a ) ( ii ) should be moved to paragraph 1 ( b ) and be placed within separate square brackets , pending determination by the Commission of the placement of that provision .  
Before entering into a discussion of the provisions of chapter V , the Working Group considered the general usefulness of chapter V and its scope as reflected in draft article 1 , paragraph 4 , which appeared within square brackets pending final determination of the scope or the purpose of chapter V . It was generally agreed that chapter V was useful for States that did not have any rules on the law applicable to assignment-related issues or did not have adequate rules on all such issues . 
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
The definition and methodology lacked clarity , and the concept seemed more appropriate for a multinational corporation for which profit was paramount than for a multilateral international organization pursuing sensitive and complex political and socio-economic objectives agreed upon by consensus .  
Accordingly , the Executive Committee agreed to entrust their regional managers with the effective monitoring of CCAs and UNDAFs in their respective regions and to task them proactively to provide the necessary support to their country representatives , to contribute to and use the results of the CCA / UNDAF Learning Network on a systematic basis and to continue their joint inter-agency meetings and reports to the Executive Committee either on a quarterly or a biannual basis .  
We stress the importance of a G-77 / G-8 dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership as an essential mechanism for the discussion of emerging and urgent issues relevant to the strengthening of a global partnership for development to further strengthen the efforts of the international community with respect to adopting a positive agenda and addressing development issues of international concern , including the implementation of the agreed commitments and outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits .  
It was generally agreed that the development of new information and communication technologies and the emergence of a new knowledge economy offer vast potential for more effective , wider and faster collection and dissemination of information , including for public participation .  The Internet , in particular , can open up new opportunities , such as providing access to a wide range of previously inaccessible environmental databases .  
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
The Subcommittee agreed that the draft Unidroit convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property represented an important initiative that was of considerable interest to member States .  
The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
To appeal to the United States of America to engage in a direct dialogue on equal terms with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , in order to discuss and resolve whatever factors may be preventing the normalization of bilateral relations between the two countries , and allow the Lockerbie case to take its legal and judicial course , as required by the nature of the dispute and as agreed by all parties , free from pressures of any kind ;  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
As regards the particular issue under consideration , the Working Group agreed , however , that the place of conclusion of a contract , as traditionally understood in private international law , might not provide sufficient basis for a workable solution in an electronic environment and that other , more modern concepts , such as the notion of centre of gravity of a contract or other related notions , might also be considered .  
The meeting had been inconclusive , however , and the Personal Envoy had called upon the parties to come forward at a meeting to be held in June , with concrete solutions to the multiple problems of the settlement plan that the parties could agree to , or else be prepared to consider and discuss other ways to achieve an early , durable and agreed resolution of their dispute over Western Sahara .  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
The Rio Group agreed with the Secretary-General that a simple , transparent and equitable reimbursement system was paramount for the efficient and effective functioning of peacekeeping operations .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the post-Phase V Working Group on reformed procedures for determining reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment had validated the methodology and agreed on revised reimbursement rates for major equipment , self-sustainment rates for some special cases , new categories of major equipment , generic reimbursement for painting jobs of major equipment and new rates for medical services .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
The LDC Governments should undertake this task within their respective national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , PRSPs , CCAs and UNDAF , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue .  The development partners should support agreed objectives and policies designed by LDCs on the basis of the Programme of Action and existing national development and cooperation frameworks .  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
UNFPA agreed to organize the eighth Round Table on Communication for Development , scheduled to take place from 26 to 29 November 2001 in Managua , Nicaragua , and proposed the following three central issues : evaluating the information programmes designed to halt the HIV / AIDS pandemic ; development of methodologies to evaluate current communication programmes ; and using community radio to reach the disadvantaged .  
It was agreed that current strategies of the United Nations system should focus on providing assistance for poor African countries to get access to the fruits of globalization through improved terms of trade , increased ODA , capital flows and investments and access to information and communication technology and global public goods .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
The Special Adviser attended the seventh annual Congress of the International Ombudsperson Institute held in Durban , South Africa , from 30 October to 2 November 2000 , where the participating Ombudspersons and national institutions agreed that living in a society that pursues good governance practices is a basic human right .  59 .  An increasing number of national institutions take the opportunity of addressing the Commission on Human Rights in its annual sessions .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
With respect to protecting the environment , it was agreed that LDC-specific objectives defined in Agenda 2111 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session , 12 as well as commitments from multilateral environmental agreements , must be the basis for the actions by least developed countries and their development partners outlined in the Programme of Action .  
Development partners agreed to effectively implement the enhanced HIPC Initiative and provide adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and provide new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing .  
It was agreed that the existing country review mechanisms such as the World Banks consultative group and UNDPs round-table meetings should continue as principal coordination forums for development cooperation , as well as for mobilizing external development resources for least developed countries , based on national development frameworks .  
They agreed that it was vital to address the problem in a comprehensive , integrated , sustainable and efficient manner , and recommended a series of practical actions to be taken by OAU member States at the national and regional levels .  
As regards record-keeping , views were expressed that there was also a need to establish agreed minimum standards ; it was noted that national systems for record-keeping could vary according to differing national circumstances and regulatory arrangements , provided that national authorities ensured that the systems in their country were sufficient to enable individual arms to be identified and traced in a timely and reliable manner .  
That is why we fully agreed with the Chilean representative when , on behalf of the countries of the Rio Group , he stated the firm conviction that measures should be adopted that will contribute to an effective and gradual limitation and monitoring of defence costs in the region , ultimately ensuring the availability of more resources for the social and economic development of our peoples .  
Calls upon all relevant bodies , agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental , regional and subregional organizations , within their continuing mandated activities , to continue to address the issue of international migration and development and to provide appropriate support for interregional , regional and subregional processes and activities on international migration and development , with a view to integrating migration issues in a more coherent way within the broader context of the implementation of agreed economic and social development programmes ;  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , in which the nuclear-weapon States agreed to an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals , proved that the NPT is the main and most effective legal basis for actions to prohibit and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
International efforts in response to that threat , particularly those agreed on at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , reflected widespread awareness of the need to take global , integrated action to reduce drug abuse and eliminate illicit trafficking .  
The various measures agreed on , particularly the creation at the national , regional and international levels of strategies and plans of action , required widespread support to the countries involved in the struggle as well as the promotion at the international level of legal cooperation and strengthening of cross-border controls .  
While reaffirming its importance for the purpose of making legislators aware of the implications of their policy choices in the field of privately financed infrastructure , the Working Group agreed that the recommendation had an educational rather than a prescriptive character and therefore was not suitable to be transformed into a model legislative provision .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Accordingly , it was agreed that it would be useful to draft a model legislative provision reflecting the recommendation , for the purpose of either eliminating existing legal obstacles or to overcoming possible contrary practices of judicial or administrative authorities .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , [ 3 ] the first special session devoted to disarmament , calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems , and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time frames , wherever feasible , for the progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time ,
