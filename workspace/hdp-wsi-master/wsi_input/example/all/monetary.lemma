" The current accommodative monetary policy , on top a still robust underlying growth in productivity , should be sufficient to foster an improving corporate business climate over time " .  
The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
To improve its monetary policy-related work , the committee has , since 1999 , held meetings of economic and financial experts at regular intervals .  The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
The conveyance of policy must be rapid , prompt , and accurate ; market interest rates and flexible foreign exchange rate mechanisms must be closely coordinated ; and opportunities for speculative profit-taking in capital and foreign exchange must be prevented through a sound monetary and foreign currency market .  
At a high-level international symposium on the reform of China 's monetary sector held a few days ago , Wu Xiaoling stated that the main directions of China 's monetary policy reforms are : We will further improve our monetary policy system with emphasis on indirect regulation and control , and give more play to open market operations and the regulatory role of rediscount rates and bank interest rates to ensure the smooth attainment of the targets of our monetary policy .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
It will also listen to and deliberate the State Council reports on strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing farmers ' income , on improving the social security system , on implementing the monetary policy , on cracking down on the manufacture and sales of fakes and shoddy products , and on stepping up public order .  
First , with regard to assuring the requirements of monetary policy and financial supervision and control and raising the level at which duties and responsibilities are carried out according to law , the bank has established scientific , highly effective systems for financial statistics and for off-site management and control . 
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
According to the experts attending the seminar from home and abroad while summing up the successful experience in the operation of China 's monetary policies over the past few years , there are some essential characteristics as follows : First , the principle of moderation has been adhered to , that is , the stabilization of currency value has been taken as the most important objective and the relationship between the prevention of financial risks and economic growth has been correctly handled ;  
She hoped that all relevant ministries and state commissions make further effort , guarantee the smooth operation of the existing work mechanisms , and further strengthen cooperation among the customs , financial , monetary , taxation , and quality inspection departments , continue to implement the current supportive and encouraging policies and measures , and ensure the smooth development of the work of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .

To cope with the deflationary trend , we should change the previous prudent and conservative attitude toward the monetary policy , positively coordinate it with the financial policy , and follow up the policies closely to form the dual pushing forces for economic growth through the practice of a positive financial policy and moderate monetary policy .  
Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .  
A few years ago , EU concentrated its energies on building a great internal market and an economic and monetary union , as well as on implementing a unified currency policy ; therefore , debate over the nature of EU 's future was put aside temporarily .  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
Dai Xianglong said : China has extricated itself from the impact of the Asian financial crisis .  However , in face of the challenges of the financial globalization , the PBOC will continue to practice a moderate monetary policy , further the reform of interest rate marketization , institute a modern commercial banking system , further improve and perfect a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system taking the market supply and demand as its foundation , and open the financial sector wider to the world .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
In order to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development during the 10th Five-year Plan , we should continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a steady monetary policy , so as to spur investment and consumption and encourage exports .  
On the basis of making a thorough analysis of the situation and assuming overall responsibility , the party and government judged the hour and sized up the situation , pooled the masses ' wisdom , and put forward a series of major measures for enlivening the economy and stimulating demand : Putting into effect an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy ;  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
Xiang Huaicheng said that compared with other constantly developing regional cooperation organization , especially the European economic and monetary union , differences between Asian countries still exist in terms of history , culture , political system , and the level of economic development , and diversification is an conspicuous problem .  This determines that East Asia cooperation is a long-term arduous task .  It is necessary to choose the way and road for cooperation in light of its own characteristics , and the mode of development of other regional cooperation organizations should not be copied mechanically .  
China 's banking , securities , and insurance systems have earnestly implemented the central authorities ' financial policies and measures , pursued prudent monetary policies , effectively supported industrial restructuring , and effectively helped state enterprises in resolving their difficulties and restructuring .  
The meeting gave a preliminary analysis and forecast for the 2001 financial situation .  It endorsed the PBOC 's anticipated targets of monetary and credit control : M2 is projected to grow by 13 to 14 percent and M1 15 to 16 percent .  Net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to growth by 1.3 trillion yuan , about the same level as last year .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
It will hear and deliberate the State Council 's topical reports on strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , on increasing farmer income , on improving the social security system , on implementing a steady and reliable monetary policy , on combating counterfeit and inferior goods , and on improving cultural market management .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
To help monetary and securities companies and large industrial and commercial enterprises accurately grasp the development trend of China 's macro-economy and monetary and securities market , a " high-level symposium on the development of China 's macro-economic situation , industrial policy , and securities market during the 10th Five-Year Plan Period " was held in Beijing from 17 to 18 March , at which famous Chinese economic experts aired their views on our country 's current macro-economic situation and its future development trend . 
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own private property in accordance with law and may , on its own , formulate its economic , trade , monetary , financial , educational , scientific and technological , cultural and sports policies in accordance with law .  It will have independent finances , practise an independent taxation system and be a separate customs territory .  
These are a high savings rate , a dedicated and flexible labour force with good education and professional training , a well - established and properly supervised banking sector , advanced infrastructure for the financial markets , fiscal and monetary prudence , a government supporting the private sector but not imposing government leadership on economic development , and last but not the least , the rule of law . 
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal trans-shipments , and protect intellectual property rights .  
We are gathered here today for a common objective - international economic and monetary cooperation to achieve stable global development , prosperity and stability .  
Mr Little said that apart from legal co-operation arrangements , the Basic Law also authorises the Hong Kong SAR to enter into binding international agreements with foreign States and international organisations in various fields including economic , trade , financial and monetary , shipping , communications , tourism , cultural and sport .  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and the independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to control trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transhipments , and to protect intellectual property rights .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision as well as sophisticated financial infrastructure have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
For example , Article 109 provides that the HKSAR government shall maintain the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre .  Article 110 provides that the HKSAR government shall , on its own , formulate monetary and financial policies .  Article 111 prescribes that the Hong Kong dollar , as the legal tender in the HKSAR , shall continue to circulate .  Article 112 states that no foreign exchange control policies shall be applied in the HKSAR and that the Hong Kong dollar shall be freely convertible .  
Two years ago , gloomy scenarios were being painted - not about an Asian financial crisis - but about the impending demise of Hong Kong 's monetary autonomy under Chinese rule : about the breaking of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S . dollar , the absorption of Hong Kong 's substantial foreign reserves by the Mainland , and so on .  
This is a challenging enough task for the highly trained staff in central banks of developed economies , who generally benefit from dealing with a relatively stable economic structure and from considerable experience in monetary management under floating exchange rates .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .  
( a ) of the total number of cases handled by the Police since 1996 involving the unauthorised use of personal data leading to monetary losses ; the average number of alleged acts of unauthorised use of personal data and the average amount of losses in each cases ;

It establishes the Hong Kong SAR as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transshipments , and infringement of intellectual property rights .

Maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong , continuing to improve the regulatory framework , improving the infrastructure required for a first class international financial centre and spearheading the further development of the financial markets are targets that we are committed to achieve .  
Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
With regard to the option of enlarging the monetary base , Members concluded that the only practical way of achieving this would be through deliberate issuance of additional Exchange Fund paper ( which would , via market forces , attract roughly equivalent inflows , thereby increasing the monetary base and lowering the backing ratio ) .  
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
These changes included strengthening the monetary system to provide a greater buffer against attacks on the currency ; strengthening the banking system ; improving market regulations and stimulating the merger and demutualisation of the stock and futures exchanges ; closing loopholes in legislation ; and making the financial system far more open and transparent .  
We are committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong ; improving the regulatory framework ; and enhancing the infrastructure required for an international financial centre and providing an appropriate environment for an open , fair and efficient market ; and spearheading the further development of the financial markets .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "

The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
( a ) The Linked Exchange Rate provides a stable , predictable and well understood monetary system that is well suited to Hong Kong 's highly external and flexible economy and to its position as an international financial centre .  
The Government noted today ( May 8 ) that the Standard &amp; amp ; Poor 's ( S &amp; amp ; P ) had affirmed its ratings ( sovereign foreign and local currency ratings at " A + " and " AA - " respectively ) and the stable outlook of Hong Kong SAR . .  " We are glad that S &amp; amp ; P has recognised Hong Kong 's autonomy in economic and monetary policies , which are proven effective and robust in the past years .  
The estimates derived from the model suggested that about half of the swings in property prices in Hong Kong since the early 1990s could be attributed to changes in fundamental variables , such as macro-economic activity , monetary conditions , demographic movement and public housing supply .

A further , accompanying letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority , also dated June 25 , 2003 , specifies the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong : this is defined as a stable external exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong , in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar , at around HK $ 7.80 to US $ 1 , maintained through a currency board system .

The call for monetary internationalization has been loud and clear recently . It has also become the vogue of our times . After World War , as international investment and international trade expanded , the international money market also experienced rapid development . Banks from various economically advanced nations established branches in foreign countries one after another , thus becoming a part of the close-knit international money market network .  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .

Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
The Treaty must lay down the legal and organizational prerequisites for achieving increased integration with a view to forming an economic , monetary and political union ;  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .

We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
We are pleased to report that our Government has assigned the highest priority to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a consistent and coherent set of monetary , exchange-rate and fiscal policies .

Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
The most frequently used conversion factor to translate economic aggregates in national currencies into a common unit of account , MERs are annual average rates communicated to IMF by the monetary authority of each member country and agreed to by the Fund . The IMF market rate refers to the principal exchange rate used for the majority of current transactions .  
Most recently , in 1993 , the Organization retained the services of a well-known travel consultant to draft a request for proposal , which contained stringent requirements concerning measurable performance standards and required that offers included a proposed budget for the travel agency to permit a better understanding of the financial considerations with a view to maximizing the monetary gain for the Organization .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
As part of the reforms which should , in the experts ' view , be introduced to improve the international economic environment , reference was made to the urgent need to reform the international monetary system in order to correct current distortions and discourage speculative financial transactions .  
Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
It is particularly difficult to apply meaningfully when the respondent is asked to express a value for many functions of the forest that have no established monetary market value , such as provision of cleaner water , which might become available in a hypothetical set of circumstances , such as through reduction in upstream harvesting activities . 
The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
The final communiqu of the meeting addressed issues relevant to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , including strengthening economic and monetary cooperation ; promoting strong and mutually beneficial growth of trade and investment ; enhancing the approach to employment problems ; implementing a new global partnership for development ; enhancing the effectiveness of multilateral institutions for the benefit of development ; providing necessary multilateral support for development ; and successful integration into the global economy of countries with economies in transition .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The Statistical Commission expressed its appreciation for the report of the Task Force ; recognized the importance of finance statistics for economic analysis and policy-making ; and emphasized the need to produce consistent standards on monetary and financial statistics that were harmonized with the concepts of the 1993 SNA .  
In the context of the requirements established for the European Monetary Union , Eurostat and EMI have identified a broad range of actions for financial statistics that include the development of a methodology for monetary statistics clean of cross-border business and reflecting the adoption of harmonized concepts and definitions ( residency , currency breakdown , coverage ) , all within the framework of the European System of Accounts .  
The draft manual on monetary and financial statistics and an annotated outline of the revised Manual on Government Finance Statistics have been sent for comment to national statistical offices ; central banks and ministries of finance of member countries ; international organizations , including members of the Task Force ; and other interested parties .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
The harsh economic climate in the period since UNCED has meant that available professional and monetary resources have actually decreased drastically over the period , rather than increasing to reflect the extra efforts implicit in the follow-up to the Conference .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
In fact , a monetary union without political union is virtually unprecedented for such a large , heterogeneous group of industrialized economies . 16 It is important to note that there are no legal provisions for an orderly exit of a country from EMU . 
An independent central bank not only ensures low and stable rates of inflation , but through its autonomy from governmental interference in monetary policy also contributes to a healthy division of power in the economic sphere .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
As has been observed even in Europe , which is the most advanced along the road to regional consolidation , and where economic and monetary union have become a reality , in the European Union there is no agreement on the rotational model .  
Pensioners and invalids receive monetary benefits , housing and communal services on advantageous terms , and free travel on urban overground electrically powered public transport , all as part of a single package .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
One downside risk , possibly the worst , is that of a hard landing for the United States , either because of a stock market crash , which would reduce the wealth of economic actors , or because the authorities reacted to a sign of inflationary pressures by tightening monetary policy so sharply as to produce a decline rather than a moderate deceleration of output growth .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
The conceptual bases included absolute , relative and subjective indicators ; single and multidimensional measures ; monetary and non-monetary measures ; and the dynamics of poverty .  
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .

His delegation was convinced that the success of all the measures envisaged would be contingent on the restructuring of the international financial and monetary architecture to ensure a more stable and participatory system and the provision of coherent links between finance , trade and development .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
Subject to the legal principles of the State Party , the liability of legal persons may be criminal , civil or administrative and such persons , if held liable , shall be subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .

Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
Furthermore , previous United Nations conferences had developed social rather than development agendas ; there could be no development agenda without full consideration of financial , monetary and trade issues at the national , international and systemic levels .  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .

One panellist considered that the success of European monetary integration had been favoured by the close trade ties among the countries involved and had been based on a unique and historically motivated political commitment by EU member States , which so far was still lacking in Asia , for example , and which in general was difficult to replicate elsewhere .

The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .

The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
The conveyance of policy must be rapid , prompt , and accurate ; market interest rates and flexible foreign exchange rate mechanisms must be closely coordinated ; and opportunities for speculative profit-taking in capital and foreign exchange must be prevented through a sound monetary and foreign currency market .  
At a high-level international symposium on the reform of China 's monetary sector held a few days ago , Wu Xiaoling stated that the main directions of China 's monetary policy reforms are : We will further improve our monetary policy system with emphasis on indirect regulation and control , and give more play to open market operations and the regulatory role of rediscount rates and bank interest rates to ensure the smooth attainment of the targets of our monetary policy .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .

Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
According to the experts attending the seminar from home and abroad while summing up the successful experience in the operation of China 's monetary policies over the past few years , there are some essential characteristics as follows : First , the principle of moderation has been adhered to , that is , the stabilization of currency value has been taken as the most important objective and the relationship between the prevention of financial risks and economic growth has been correctly handled ;

Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .

To cope with the deflationary trend , we should change the previous prudent and conservative attitude toward the monetary policy , positively coordinate it with the financial policy , and follow up the policies closely to form the dual pushing forces for economic growth through the practice of a positive financial policy and moderate monetary policy .  
Standing committee member Feng Henggao emphasized that the draft amendments should set forth express provisions against judicial corruption , so as to eliminate any bias out of favoritism and monetary consideration .  He suggested that more measures should be adopted to strengthen supervision of judges and procurators by the people 's congress , the mass media , and the public , and heavier punishment should be imposed on any law enforcement personnel that violate laws , so as to prevent and reduce judicial corruption .  
A few years ago , EU concentrated its energies on building a great internal market and an economic and monetary union , as well as on implementing a unified currency policy ; therefore , debate over the nature of EU 's future was put aside temporarily .  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
Dai Xianglong said : China has extricated itself from the impact of the Asian financial crisis .  However , in face of the challenges of the financial globalization , the PBOC will continue to practice a moderate monetary policy , further the reform of interest rate marketization , institute a modern commercial banking system , further improve and perfect a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system taking the market supply and demand as its foundation , and open the financial sector wider to the world .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
In order to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development during the 10th Five-year Plan , we should continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a steady monetary policy , so as to spur investment and consumption and encourage exports .  
On the basis of making a thorough analysis of the situation and assuming overall responsibility , the party and government judged the hour and sized up the situation , pooled the masses ' wisdom , and put forward a series of major measures for enlivening the economy and stimulating demand : Putting into effect an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy ;  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
Xiang Huaicheng said that compared with other constantly developing regional cooperation organization , especially the European economic and monetary union , differences between Asian countries still exist in terms of history , culture , political system , and the level of economic development , and diversification is an conspicuous problem .  This determines that East Asia cooperation is a long-term arduous task .  It is necessary to choose the way and road for cooperation in light of its own characteristics , and the mode of development of other regional cooperation organizations should not be copied mechanically .  
China 's banking , securities , and insurance systems have earnestly implemented the central authorities ' financial policies and measures , pursued prudent monetary policies , effectively supported industrial restructuring , and effectively helped state enterprises in resolving their difficulties and restructuring .  
The meeting gave a preliminary analysis and forecast for the 2001 financial situation .  It endorsed the PBOC 's anticipated targets of monetary and credit control : M2 is projected to grow by 13 to 14 percent and M1 15 to 16 percent .  Net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to growth by 1.3 trillion yuan , about the same level as last year .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
It will hear and deliberate the State Council 's topical reports on strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , on increasing farmer income , on improving the social security system , on implementing a steady and reliable monetary policy , on combating counterfeit and inferior goods , and on improving cultural market management .  
It will hear and review special State Council work reports on strengthening the basic position of agriculture and raising farmers ' income , improving the social security system , implementing a moderate monetary policy , curbing counterfeit and poor products , and intensifying the management of the cultural market .  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
To help monetary and securities companies and large industrial and commercial enterprises accurately grasp the development trend of China 's macro-economy and monetary and securities market , a " high-level symposium on the development of China 's macro-economic situation , industrial policy , and securities market during the 10th Five-Year Plan Period " was held in Beijing from 17 to 18 March , at which famous Chinese economic experts aired their views on our country 's current macro-economic situation and its future development trend . 
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own private property in accordance with law and may , on its own , formulate its economic , trade , monetary , financial , educational , scientific and technological , cultural and sports policies in accordance with law .  It will have independent finances , practise an independent taxation system and be a separate customs territory .  
These are a high savings rate , a dedicated and flexible labour force with good education and professional training , a well - established and properly supervised banking sector , advanced infrastructure for the financial markets , fiscal and monetary prudence , a government supporting the private sector but not imposing government leadership on economic development , and last but not the least , the rule of law . 
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal trans-shipments , and protect intellectual property rights .  
We are gathered here today for a common objective - international economic and monetary cooperation to achieve stable global development , prosperity and stability .  
Mr Little said that apart from legal co-operation arrangements , the Basic Law also authorises the Hong Kong SAR to enter into binding international agreements with foreign States and international organisations in various fields including economic , trade , financial and monetary , shipping , communications , tourism , cultural and sport .  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and the independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to control trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transhipments , and to protect intellectual property rights .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision as well as sophisticated financial infrastructure have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
For example , Article 109 provides that the HKSAR government shall maintain the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre .  Article 110 provides that the HKSAR government shall , on its own , formulate monetary and financial policies .  Article 111 prescribes that the Hong Kong dollar , as the legal tender in the HKSAR , shall continue to circulate .  Article 112 states that no foreign exchange control policies shall be applied in the HKSAR and that the Hong Kong dollar shall be freely convertible .  
Two years ago , gloomy scenarios were being painted - not about an Asian financial crisis - but about the impending demise of Hong Kong 's monetary autonomy under Chinese rule : about the breaking of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S . dollar , the absorption of Hong Kong 's substantial foreign reserves by the Mainland , and so on .  
This is a challenging enough task for the highly trained staff in central banks of developed economies , who generally benefit from dealing with a relatively stable economic structure and from considerable experience in monetary management under floating exchange rates .  
Decision-making power for monetary policy must be vested in an agency that is both independent but accountable ; other macroeconomic policies must be harmonised ; and structural policies must support the flexible adjustment needed to accommodate shocks .  
( a ) of the total number of cases handled by the Police since 1996 involving the unauthorised use of personal data leading to monetary losses ; the average number of alleged acts of unauthorised use of personal data and the average amount of losses in each cases ;  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes the Hong Kong SAR as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transshipments , and infringement of intellectual property rights .  
The proposals , he cited , included amendments to make unauthorised recordings in cinemas an offence , to broaden the definition of infringing activities to include anything other than those intended for personal and domestic purposes , to incorporate copyright and counterfeiting offences into the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance for the purposes of attracting heavier penalties and forfeiture of monetary proceeds from such illegal activities .  
Maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong , continuing to improve the regulatory framework , improving the infrastructure required for a first class international financial centre and spearheading the further development of the financial markets are targets that we are committed to achieve .  
Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
With regard to the option of enlarging the monetary base , Members concluded that the only practical way of achieving this would be through deliberate issuance of additional Exchange Fund paper ( which would , via market forces , attract roughly equivalent inflows , thereby increasing the monetary base and lowering the backing ratio ) .  
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
These changes included strengthening the monetary system to provide a greater buffer against attacks on the currency ; strengthening the banking system ; improving market regulations and stimulating the merger and demutualisation of the stock and futures exchanges ; closing loopholes in legislation ; and making the financial system far more open and transparent .  
We are committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong ; improving the regulatory framework ; and enhancing the infrastructure required for an international financial centre and providing an appropriate environment for an open , fair and efficient market ; and spearheading the further development of the financial markets .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
( a ) The Linked Exchange Rate provides a stable , predictable and well understood monetary system that is well suited to Hong Kong 's highly external and flexible economy and to its position as an international financial centre .  
The Government noted today ( May 8 ) that the Standard &amp; amp ; Poor 's ( S &amp; amp ; P ) had affirmed its ratings ( sovereign foreign and local currency ratings at " A + " and " AA - " respectively ) and the stable outlook of Hong Kong SAR . .  " We are glad that S &amp; amp ; P has recognised Hong Kong 's autonomy in economic and monetary policies , which are proven effective and robust in the past years .  
The estimates derived from the model suggested that about half of the swings in property prices in Hong Kong since the early 1990s could be attributed to changes in fundamental variables , such as macro-economic activity , monetary conditions , demographic movement and public housing supply .  The other half was explained by the build-up of a bubble and its sudden collapse .  
A further , accompanying letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority , also dated June 25 , 2003 , specifies the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong : this is defined as a stable external exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong , in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar , at around HK $ 7.80 to US $ 1 , maintained through a currency board system .  
Members noted the publication on June 27 of the letter from the Financial Secretary to the Monetary Authority , dated June 25 2003 , formally specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong : this was defined in the letter as continuing to be a stable external exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong , in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign exchange market against the US dollar , at around HK $ 7.80 to US $ 1 , maintained through a currency board system .  
The main challenges in central banking are to maintain a monetary and banking environment that is optimal for stable and sustainable economic growth , and , particularly in the case of present-day Hong Kong , an environment that is conducive to resolving our current problems .  
The participants were divided into eight panel groups to discuss specific topics in their specialized field , education and culture , business and industry , financial and monetary affairs communications reconstruction , agricultural reconstruction , social welfare , public health and urban development .  
The call for monetary internationalization has been loud and clear recently . It has also become the vogue of our times . After World War , as international investment and international trade expanded , the international money market also experienced rapid development . Banks from various economically advanced nations established branches in foreign countries one after another , thus becoming a part of the close-knit international money market network .  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
However , money is not static . It ebbs and flows like water , and if for a while it is silent or flows out of the country this does not mean that its power has been lost , all the more so since exchange rates and tariffs have become more reasonable and are unlikely to once again become a major factor depressing prices . If prices are to be kept stable , this will depend entirely on controlling monetary deposits and the flow of funds .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
mitterrand and kohl said that europe should not miss the " historical chance " and establish the economic and monetary union and carry out common foreign and security policies in line with the set agenda  
kiev , february 24 ( xinhua ) the ukrainian parliament today stressed that the republic of crimea is an autonomous part of ukraine , and can not have its own armed forces , monetary and financial system , or develop political ties with foreign nations  
but kohl emphasized that the conditions set for the economic and monetary union by the maastricht treaty should not be relaxed this is a change from his position earlier when he called for a postponement of the timetable by one or two years in view of the crisis of the european monetary system

Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .

We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
We are pleased to report that our Government has assigned the highest priority to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a consistent and coherent set of monetary , exchange-rate and fiscal policies .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
It was recognized that , in order to reduce unemployment and enlarge growth potential , appropriate monetary and fiscal policies should be accompanied by structural reforms designed to improve the functioning of markets .  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
Under meetings , seminars and workshops , most member organizations have specific plans and dates for training courses on national accounts concepts and practices and other specialized statistical systems linked with the SNA , such as balance of payments , government finance , and monetary and financial statistics , as well as interregional and regional workshops and seminars on practical implementation of the 1993 SNA .  
Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
The most frequently used conversion factor to translate economic aggregates in national currencies into a common unit of account , MERs are annual average rates communicated to IMF by the monetary authority of each member country and agreed to by the Fund . The IMF market rate refers to the principal exchange rate used for the majority of current transactions .  
Most recently , in 1993 , the Organization retained the services of a well-known travel consultant to draft a request for proposal , which contained stringent requirements concerning measurable performance standards and required that offers included a proposed budget for the travel agency to permit a better understanding of the financial considerations with a view to maximizing the monetary gain for the Organization .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
As part of the reforms which should , in the experts ' view , be introduced to improve the international economic environment , reference was made to the urgent need to reform the international monetary system in order to correct current distortions and discourage speculative financial transactions .  
Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;

The growth and the current vast size of the international capital markets , along with the ease of capital mobility across borders , have come to exert considerable influence on national monetary and exchange rate policies , occasionally threatening the stability of either one or the other .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;

The final communiqu of the meeting addressed issues relevant to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , including strengthening economic and monetary cooperation ; promoting strong and mutually beneficial growth of trade and investment ; enhancing the approach to employment problems ; implementing a new global partnership for development ; enhancing the effectiveness of multilateral institutions for the benefit of development ; providing necessary multilateral support for development ; and successful integration into the global economy of countries with economies in transition .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .

The Statistical Commission expressed its appreciation for the report of the Task Force ; recognized the importance of finance statistics for economic analysis and policy-making ; and emphasized the need to produce consistent standards on monetary and financial statistics that were harmonized with the concepts of the 1993 SNA .  
In the context of the requirements established for the European Monetary Union , Eurostat and EMI have identified a broad range of actions for financial statistics that include the development of a methodology for monetary statistics clean of cross-border business and reflecting the adoption of harmonized concepts and definitions ( residency , currency breakdown , coverage ) , all within the framework of the European System of Accounts .  
The draft manual on monetary and financial statistics and an annotated outline of the revised Manual on Government Finance Statistics have been sent for comment to national statistical offices ; central banks and ministries of finance of member countries ; international organizations , including members of the Task Force ; and other interested parties .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
The harsh economic climate in the period since UNCED has meant that available professional and monetary resources have actually decreased drastically over the period , rather than increasing to reflect the extra efforts implicit in the follow-up to the Conference .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
In fact , a monetary union without political union is virtually unprecedented for such a large , heterogeneous group of industrialized economies . 16 It is important to note that there are no legal provisions for an orderly exit of a country from EMU . 
An independent central bank not only ensures low and stable rates of inflation , but through its autonomy from governmental interference in monetary policy also contributes to a healthy division of power in the economic sphere .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
As has been observed even in Europe , which is the most advanced along the road to regional consolidation , and where economic and monetary union have become a reality , in the European Union there is no agreement on the rotational model .  
Pensioners and invalids receive monetary benefits , housing and communal services on advantageous terms , and free travel on urban overground electrically powered public transport , all as part of a single package .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
It is the obligation of the entire international presence in Kosovo and Metohija to strictly respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija , which implies respect for its political , administrative , legal , economic and monetary system and an unhindered functioning of public services in accordance with all Yugoslav laws and regulations ;  
Facing the growing threat of a global deflationary spiral , central banks in the major developed economies , led by the monetary authorities the Federal Reserve System or Fed of the United States , started to ease monetary policy in the autumn of 1998 .  
One downside risk , possibly the worst , is that of a hard landing for the United States , either because of a stock market crash , which would reduce the wealth of economic actors , or because the authorities reacted to a sign of inflationary pressures by tightening monetary policy so sharply as to produce a decline rather than a moderate deceleration of output growth .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
The conceptual bases included absolute , relative and subjective indicators ; single and multidimensional measures ; monetary and non-monetary measures ; and the dynamics of poverty .  
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
On the other hand , there is resistance to strengthened multilateral surveillance over the monetary and exchange-rate policies of the major industrialized countries and to global rules regarding international capital movements .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
His delegation was convinced that the success of all the measures envisaged would be contingent on the restructuring of the international financial and monetary architecture to ensure a more stable and participatory system and the provision of coherent links between finance , trade and development .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
Subject to the legal principles of the State Party , the liability of legal persons may be criminal , civil or administrative and such persons , if held liable , shall be subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
Joint actions by the States Parties to promote trade and economic cooperation and overcome the consequences of the financial and economic crisis have been agreed , the foundations for joint customs tariffs have been laid , and measures to strengthen cooperation between national monetary and financial systems have been defined .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
Furthermore , previous United Nations conferences had developed social rather than development agendas ; there could be no development agenda without full consideration of financial , monetary and trade issues at the national , international and systemic levels .
