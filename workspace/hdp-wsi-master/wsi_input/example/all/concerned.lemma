Addressing a national conference of nationalities affairs commissions on economic work which closed today , Li Dezhu , Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , noted : as far as ethnic affairs are concerned , we must be brave in blazing new trails , boldly explore new frontiers , improve the quality of our work , thus make contributions to the large-scale development of the western region .  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
Those responsible for primary party organizations must persistently follow the style of being truthful and realistic , waging a hard struggle , and working hard , establish themselves among the masses , be concerned about their weal and woe , put the interests of the party and the people above everything else , and , with enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility , lead the masses in striding toward an ever more prosperous future .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Safe production work has a direct bearing on the safety of people 's life and property , on the social stability , and the healthy development of economic construction , and on our country 's international image as well .  The governments and departments concerned at all levels and various enterprises must adhere to the principle of " safety first , prevention primary " ;  
He specially pointed out : General Secretary Jiang Zemin has always been concerned about the ideological and political education among , as well as the healthy growth of , our teenagers .

In delimiting other conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water , the city and county people 's governments concerned shall consult with one another and then propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
He stressed the need to conscientiously study and comprehensively understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's recent important speech on strengthening and improving the educational work , and implement his instructions in routine work .  School education , family education , and social education should be properly combined .  With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .  
This reporter learned from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Supervision that the discipline inspection and supervision organs of Qinghai and Hunan Provinces had strictly investigated and dealt with two typical cases of violation of the rules of integrity and self-discipline for leading cadres and the responsible persons concerned were subjected to stern party disciplinary actions and administrative punishments .  
Under the new situation , all localities and departments concerned should act according to the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council , go all out to foster the new economic growth point - - the tourist industry , and ensure that it will achieve greater results in expanding domestic demand , increasing employment , promoting opening-up , stimulating local economic growth and social development , and will continue to play a comprehensive role in economic restructuring and in the development of other related industries .  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  As far as our old-age population is concerned , however , we have a large base figure , and the number of old people is still increasing at a rapid pace .  
Finally , the " Opinion " calls on local people 's governments at all levels and the departments concerned to make overall plans for developing social welfare undertakings , set reasonable work targets , and avoid such practices as acting arbitrarily , rushing headlong into mass action , making overlapping efforts , and wasting resources .  
Zeng Peiyan held : During the third session of the ninth National Committee of the CPPCC this year , CPPCC members posed some opinions and suggestions on the issue of the grand western development , which we highly valued .  We have categorized them and sent them to departments concerned for the research purpose .  
The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
With the great support of the local port administration and experts concerned , this reserve division has researched and built a roll-on connecting bridge , thus opening up a passageway for the troops to load and unload their heavy equipment on sea .

The central leading comrades concerned personally convened a conference , laid out arrangements for investigating and handling the matter , and required that it be treated as an especially important case in centralized activities to " eliminate pornography and fight illegal publications " .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
In order to protect the safety of some particularly important or vital economic targets which bear heavily on our national or regional security , aside from employing all sorts of passive or comprehensive protection measures , we must also more vigorously build an active air defense system by focusing on the issues concerned .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .  Only by continuously improving itself , and making efforts to improve the mode of its leadership , can a local party committee really ascent a higher plain to look farther ahead and give thought to things more deeply ; and only thus can it better play a role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level .  
Guided by the central departments concerned , the Hong Kong Garrison persistently regarded studying or understanding the law as a basic project ; intensified both legal education and behavioral guidance ; and enabled both the articles and spirit of the Hong Kong Garrison Law to take root in the hearts of all the officers and men and become a conscious sense among them as well .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .

The training exercise command center on board the vessel , which had been jointly set up by the units of the state organs or military units concerned , had found out or tackled problems through coordination ; had revised in a timely fashion both the measures and steps for the wartime emergency mobilization and requisition of civilian vessels ; and had built a faster and highly efficient operational mechanism during the training exercise .  
Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council , the governments at all levels , the various departments concerned , and a multitude of enterprises have enhanced their morale , pressed forward against all odds , spared no effort in broadening their path of development , worked in a down-to-earth manner , brought about remarkable improvement to the performance of state enterprises , and played a crucial role in creating an important opportunity for effecting a change in the national economy .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
On the basis of extensively soliciting opinions from all parties concerned and conducting sufficient study or demonstrations , the General Political Department has formulated a draft amendment to our existing enlistment regulations governing officers in active service , and the draft amendment has been approved by an executive meeting of the State Council and an executive meeting of the Central Military Commission respectively . 
The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .  
This spokesman indicated : According to different actual conditions of persons concerned and in line with relevant regulations stipulated in the " Procedures for Management of Qualifications of Fund Managers " , the commission has decided to suspend the employment qualifications of the fund workers and senior fund managers who should assume direct responsibility for this corporation 's irregular activities , so as to ensure the safety of fund assets and the normal operation of fund business .

Article 36 All units shall support mass activities of military scientific research ; urge or encourage personnel with research capabilities to conduct military scientific research in light of their work ; train or foster backbone personnel for academic research ; or make things convenient or create conditions for the personnel concerned to conduct research .  
Since Bush assumed office , it seems that the hardliners have gotten the upper hand as far as foreign policy is concerned .  They appear to be more and more presumptuous , not only to China , but other countries have also taken note of it .  Even European countries with friendly ties with the US are very displeased with the US for " repudiating " what many countries had agreed upon , and refusing to sign the Kyoto Accord which sets a limit to the emission of substances that are harmful to the ozone layer .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .

According to sources , the top level of the CPC was stunned and surprised by Bush 's challenging remarks , but believes for the time being that " a conclusion should only be drawn after the matter is investigated " ; the authorities will not lightly come to a conclusion before the entire matter is verified ; until the cards are clearly seen , the Beijing departments concerned will adopt an approach of " coolly observing the changes " regarding the US hardline policy on China .  
The priorities of priorities in educational development in minority areas are to introduce nine-year compulsory education and eliminate illiteracy among young people so as to promote the healthy and balanced development of all types of education .  All provinces and autonomous regions concerned must work harder at comprehensive planning as far as educational reform and development in minority areas are concerned .  First , rely on reform deepening .  
As far as the departments are concerned , in calculating how much money they can spend in the future , they do not take the budget for the previous year as the base figure but instead make decisions according to how many tasks they have ; if they have tasks to accomplish , they will have the money to spend , and if the tasks have been completed , their funds are cancelled accordingly ; thus we ensure that all expenditure goes on the crucial points in building the units .  
The Party 's Central Committee and the State Council place a high level of emphasis on these issues and are extremely concerned with safeguarding the lives of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and their re-employment .  They are speeding up implementation of social security system reform and have done a great deal of highly effective work to bring about the two ' guarantees ' ( guaranteeing the basic living expenses of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and guaranteeing the on-time issue and proper amount of old age pensions for retired workers ) .  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .

An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
In the event that the provincial ( regional , and municipal ) and city party committees are unable to call such a plenary meeting , their standing committees may call a similar meeting to decide on the matter .

The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .

First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
We should not ignore concrete requirements and " minor issues " in the daily lives of the masses .  For instance , leaders should be concerned about whether the food provided in the canteens at grassroots units is satisfactory or not , whether officers and soldiers have already observed their due holidays or not , whether problems in employment and education of their dependents have been solved or not .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
On the basis of this training and with the guidance of departments concerned under the fleet , they made bold efforts in giving up the previous drill pattern of " hitting dead targets . "  Instead , they used mobile target ships that can change direction and speed to simulate the movement of " enemy " ships .  As a result , they have greatly enhanced the difficulty in military drills .  
While talking about the issue that the party 's leading collective of the third generation has been concerned about the causes of foreign trade and economic cooperation , Shi Guangsheng said with deep emotion that the farsighted and accurate policy decisions of the party Central Committee are the fundamental reason why the cause of foreign trade and economic cooperation is growing more and more prosperous .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .

Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "

The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .

However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
It was revealed that the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . discovered that its major shareholders and the parties concerned had misappropriated a huge amount of funds , equivalent to 96 percent of its listed net assets , even more than what some major shareholders had misappropriated from " ST Monkey King " during a period of many years .  In this astonishing case , it can be said , the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . has set a vicious example for major shareholders and the parties concerned to misappropriate funds from a listed company .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year .

These patrons of puppet theatre are joined by the four puppet troupes left in Taiwan , who abandon their traditional competitive stance to come together and view the play . Professors and others concerned about the future of folk art as well as reporters and photographers with flash cameras are on the scene .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
Although mainland China 's initial responses are far from friendly , you still keep calling on them to make a rational choice . I think the people are most concerned with the question of when conditions may become ripe . What I mean is that given your understanding and knowledge of the world situation and the political developments in mainland China , when do you think conditions will become ripe for talks between the two sides as equals ? Thank you , Mr . President .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
This situation , where the " supply " of transplant organs fails to meet " demand " , is one that concerned individuals from all walks of life have been doing their best to improve in Taiwan , aided by legislative backing . The law used to hold the position that clinical death only occurs once the respiratory and circulatory systems have ceased to function - - at which time the condition of physical organs begins to decline rapidly , limiting the possibilities for transplantation .  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns . You can see from this that as far as Taiwan 's children 's books are concerned , there is not far to go in terms of raising quality .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Besides Premier Hau , there are a few others Teng has sworn to give up , such as legislator Lin Cheng-chieh , whose voice Teng describes as " splitting bamboo " ; former DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hung , who always has a " tragic " or " concerned " expression on his brow , and " is n't humorous in the least " ; or the " too handsome " vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council Ma Ying-jeou . All of them are impossible to imitate because of " innate limits . "  
Lin Yu-wen has been supervising Chan meditation for ten years and says it is because some people get the wrong teachers and get involved in a mysterious kind of " crazy Chan " that they are not concerned with morality and even cut themselves off from society . Then there is also " lazy Chan " for the indolent , which uses meditation as a pretext for doing nothing .  
First of all , father became much more clearheaded and even his extra workload could not ruffle his calm tranquility . Then there was mother , who became even more concerned about people , often asking my younger brother 's fellow students to come over and eat . My elder brothers also gradually grew less vain as they turned to the pursuit of real inner worth .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Doing away with stereotypes : As far as Chang Hsiao-hung is concerned , postmodern game stratagems , or as she terms it , " gender performance , " can lend feminism new vitality and allow it to adapt to complex , changing postmodern culture . Madonna personifies the complexities , contradictions , and ambiguities of postmodern culture . Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
It may sound odd , but here it is : Although the Nien genealogy clearly states that they are descended from the Jurchen , as far as the people of the Nien Clan Village are concerned , being identified as the heirs of Ahguda seems only to have occasional symbolic meaning , with little substantive impact .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Yet there is a sharp contrast . Japanese media have long been concerned about cross-strait relations , have deep understanding of the situation , and handled stories in a low-key fashion . US reports , on the other hand , tended to be more provocative and intense ; US reports also used more varied sources and had a more international perspective .  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
" It is really wonderful that such a rich , perfect thing can appear before all our eyes through the meticulous process of organizing , recording and production . And this clarity is not just a clarity of theory , but also an emotional clarity , between just this person and just this piece of music , here and now . Even in the present age , when tradition is in decline , a concerned person wo n't be lonely at all , but will rejoice at his or her own personal good fortune . "  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
Seeing that many Han Chinese appear to be so concerned about surveying and recording aboriginal culture , Wu has , over the past two years , begun trying to collate and systematize aboriginal culinary culture . She has already identified and recorded more than 100 varieties of wild edible plants . The most able to " eat bitterness " Wu notes that most wild vegetables are bitter .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States . American girls begin to be extremely concerned about their appearance from high school on , and many people are constantly depressed about their weight . Though the situation is not so serious in Taiwan , the mass media puts out a virtually unvarying message that beauty equals success . It is difficult for young people to resist the message implied in teenage beauty pageants , love-at-first-sight stories pairing up beautiful girls and handsome guys , and the images of pop superstars .  
Since Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency , however , the new administration has been concerned that a sudden termination of the nuclear plant might hamper economic development and strike a heavy blow to the business community . The administration accordingly instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) to set up the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Re-Evaluation Committee to weigh the relative merits of building versus scrapping the plant .  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again . ( photo by Hsueh Chi-kuang )  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
China 's rulers have supported astronomy since ancient times , and departments concerned with matters of astronomy are among the very earliest scientific research organs in the history of Chinese bureaucracy . An imperial observatory was established in 2000 BC , and its Qin dynasty successor in the 3rd century BC employed over 300 people . Astronomy has always been highly valued , and dynastic changes never resulted in a cutoff of support .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
Though there was a strongly political flavor to Giddens ' visit , commentators reflected that while his ideas are no cure-all for Taiwan , the issues he is concerned about are of direct relevance to Taiwan 's current circumstance . Now the main " homework " to be done in Taiwan is to apply these ideas to open up prior blind spots .  
" Many people find that the up-close living arrangements of the past were painful for all concerned : the mother , the daughter-in-law and the son who was stuck in between , " notes Lu Lo , assistant professor of Department of Psychology at Fu-Jen Catholic University , who also has a positive take on modern views about filial piety .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
Besides the public 's complaints that how to sort waste is not clearly defined and that the collection procedure is inconvenient , environmental groups are concerned that instituting the policy without adequate supporting measures-giving rise to problems such as insufficient publicity , the failure to purchase dedicated vehicles for collecting kitchen waste , and the still-incomplete state of processing sites-will undermine its effectiveness .  
According to Wu , schools ought to try to find the underlying reasons why " problem students " have problems . They should be less concerned with a wayward appearance than with trying to understand and deal with underlying causes , because once these are taken care of the rest will follow . If schools spend all their time trying to control outward appearances without exploring what is going on inside students , all they will achieve is a temporary stifling of emotions , which will sooner or later explode in a much more destructive way .  
As well as holding seminars and other such activities , the Educational Issues group also seeks to ' correct twisted educational values , ' " hoping to bring together the voices of concerned parents . After having held a public forum on this and come up with no obvious answers , they moved on to try tapping parent-teacher associations and study groups in an effort to establish a network and stake out a position in the community .

In addition , 74 supplementary reports containing additional information were received from the States parties , submitted either on the initiative of the States parties concerned or at the request of the Committee following its examination of their respective initial or periodic reports under the Convention .  
For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights . "  
It follows that the existence of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights in a country does not as such constitute a sufficient ground for determining that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture upon his return to that country ; additional grounds must exist that indicate that the individual concerned would be personally at risk .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
The precarious situation in Somalia and the problems posed by the destabilizing policies pursued by the National Islamic Front ( NIF ) regime in the Sudan only indicate the enormity of the tasks , which need persistent and concerted efforts by all regional and international actors concerned .  
The often heroic and painful efforts to secure medicine for the sick , insulin for diabetics , aminofilin for asthmatics and pacemakers for those with heart conditions must be recognized and acknowledged , because the providers of those medicines and the experts concerned were warned off , boycotted or proscribed by the Treasury Department of the United States . 
China believes that the improved safeguards system should be fair , objective , rational , transparent and feasible , and implemented strictly in accordance with the statute and relevant international agreements , on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of countries concerned , without jeopardizing their legitimate rights .  
As far as the United Nations is concerned , observing the principles of the sovereign equality of Member States and democracy in international relations in seeking common ground and following what is correct on the basis of mutual respect and through broad-based , active and constructive consultations represents a guarantee for formulating sound , comprehensive and correct policies .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
It is therefore essential that the international community defend the peace process , give it political , economic and moral support and encourage the parties concerned to work for a genuine peace based on mutual understanding , cooperation , security , dignity and respect for the legitimate rights of all .

As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .

As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
The Council declared that Sarajevo and other such threatened areas , in particular the towns of Tuzla , Zepa , Gorazde , Bihac , as well as Srebrenica , should be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free of armed attacks and from any other hostile act .  
There was great enthusiasm among the countries concerned for this major new initiative for South-South cooperation , which went beyond the objectives of the Caracas Programme of Action inasmuch as it sought , as the Group 's annual meetings progressed , to articulate at the level of heads of Government the economic problems faced by the South and to engage the North in a constructive dialogue .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
By taking samples at the sites concerned , the group verified that quantities of the pure chemical were indeed present and that the size of the pits in which the chemical was buried was consistent , in general terms , with the quantities of the chemical Iraq declared to be buried there .

Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the ILO International Training Centre have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
While welcoming the decision of JCGP to set a target date for this exercise , the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 199 emphasized that that process should be achieved in cooperation with host Governments in a way that increased efficiency , such as by means of the consolidation of administrative infrastructures of the organizations concerned , and with no financial increase in the cost of operations either to the United Nations system or the host developing country .

This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Considers that , in the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the Territories in question in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) , 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions ;

One can not emphasize enough the importance of debtor countries ' adherence to policies that will correct macroeconomic disequilibria , maintain a stable economic environment and make relative prices reflect real resource costs .  But these policies are not sufficient in themselves to promote fast and sustainable growth in the countries concerned , and that is the key to any strategy - as for middle-income countries - that envisions growing out from under a debt overhang .

We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
Each treatment programme is tailored to the local situation and to the needs of the victims and their families ; they are based on a comprehensive approach dealing with all the problems resulting from torture ( medical , psychological , social and economic problems ) , and taking account of the family , social and occupational environment of the individual concerned .

An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .

Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .

concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Obligations for personal services established in the current biennium shall be valid for the succeeding biennium , provided that appointments of the experts concerned are effected by the end of the current biennium and that the total period to be covered by obligations established for these purposes against the resources of the current biennium does not exceed 24 months ;  
The Government of Sri Lanka had endeavoured to reduce to the absolute minimum the hardships forced on the peoples concerned , and to that end it had taken steps to ensure that they received food , medicine and other essential items without interruption and in sufficient quantities , although the aforementioned secessionist group was diverting a substantial part of that assistance for its own war effort .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
My specific proposal is to suggest that the Fifth Committee , after adoption of the draft resolution by the Main Committee concerned on the basis of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , will take note of the estimate of additional requirements contained in the programme budget implications , on the understanding that such additional appropriation as may be necessary will be determined in the context of a revised appropriation , taking into account all relevant information , including the performance report .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
UNESCO , in close collaboration with national authorities concerned and international institutions such as ITC , will continue to monitor selected cultural sites inscribed in the World Heritage List , using remote sensing methods and GIS .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
In any case in which award of compensation has been made by the Tribunal in favour of the person concerned and the Committee has requested an advisory opinion under paragraph 2 of this article , the Secretary-General , if satisfied that such person will otherwise be handicapped in protecting his interests , shall within fifteen days of the decision to request an advisory opinion make an advance payment to him of one third of the total amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal less such termination benefits , if any , as have already been paid .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
For the fortieth session of the Commission , the Bureau has decided , on an experimental basis , to propose that the Commission organize its substantive work on implementation of the strategic objectives and actions in the critical areas of concern around a sequence of dialogues leading to agreed action-oriented conclusions on the issues concerned .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Reiterating the urgent need for all concerned in Burundi , including extremists inside and outside the country , to make concerted efforts to defuse the present crisis and to commit themselves to a dialogue aimed at establishing a permanent political settlement and the creation of conditions conducive to national reconciliation ,  
Deeply concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Deeply concerned about the critical economic and social situation prevailing in Angola , aggravated by the tremendous consequences of war which have destroyed the economic and social infrastructure ,  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;  
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
To that end , the concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
In any case in which award of compensation has been made by the Tribunal in favour of the person concerned and the Committee has requested an advisory opinion under paragraph 2 of this article , the Secretary-General , if satisfied that such person will otherwise be handicapped in protecting his interests , shall within fifteen days of the decision to request an advisory opinion make an advance payment to him of one third of the total amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal less such termination benefits , if any , as have already been paid .  
ESCAP and ECLAC have agreed to cooperate in an interregional project , developed by UNCTAD and funded by UNDP , in which the two commissions will undertake studies on the prospects and potential for mutual trade and investment cooperation among their concerned members which will provide the basis for a ministerial meeting of those countries , to be organized by UNCTAD . 
The importance of closer cooperation is recognized by all Governments , although some developing countries - while encouraging this development - are concerned that it might lead to new conditionalities and make operational activities within the United Nations system subject to the restrictive policies normally attached to loans .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
The Mission is deeply concerned at the continuation of this practice , which , given the army 's historic influence over such committees , undermines the primacy of civilian authority and also affects the human rights situation , in that members of the voluntary civil defence committees and former military commissioners are implicated in numerous complaints of human rights violations .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
It is recommended that the reports not be confined to mere lists of legal instruments adopted in the country concerned in recent years , but should also include information indicating how those legal instruments are reflected in the actual economic , political and social realities and general conditions existing in the country .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
The following narratives of ESCAP assistance to the concerned countries include : ( i ) adoption of the international standards and practices of countries with market economies , ( ii ) analytical activities , policy advice and technical assistance to the economies in transition , and ( iii ) possible ways of enhancing economic and technical cooperation among countries with economies in transition and with developing countries , in particular through cooperation with regional and subregional groupings .  
Analytical work and operational modalities for integrating the economies in transition into the regional economic mainstream have been clustered around three groups of activities : ( i ) provision of advisory , research and information services , ( ii ) the convening of intergovernmental and expert group meetings , workshops and seminars on various economic and social development issues , and ( iii ) provision of training in accordance with specific requests from the Governments concerned .  
Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
It called for an effective regional institutional mechanism to provide for a harmonized approach to transit transport matters , and it urged all concerned international and regional organizations to strengthen their activities which promoted regionally adopted legal and administrative solutions that facilitated regional and international transport and trade .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
By a letter dated 22 March 1991 ( S / 22382 ) , the representatives of the 20 States and Jordan submitted to the President of the Security Council a collective memorandum , in which they stated , inter alia , that : " The problems affecting these countries persist , and in certain respects have been aggravated , while the appeals launched pursuant to the recommendations of the Security Council Committee and addressed to all concerned by the Secretary-General have not evoked responses commensurate with the urgent needs of the affected countries . "  
It is truly regrettable that the Security Council , which bears special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , should see fit to delete these items without heed for their objective and historical value and without prior consultation with the States concerned .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,

A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .

The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
Three main problems were identified : virtually all ministries lack qualified personnel at appropriate levels to expedite externally assisted projects ; bureaucratic obstacles on the part of the Government - but also on the part of the donors - retard and even impede project implementation ; lack of coordination among donors in some sectors leads to excessive demands on the time of the Minister concerned and already overworked ministerial staff who are at times obliged to analyse and choose among similar projects presented by different donors .  
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .  
Paragraph 82 of annex I to the resolution , whereby the periodic meetings of all concerned senior secretariat officials in the economic and social sectors , under the authority of the Secretary-General , should continue to be used to improve coordination and performance , and the outcomes of those meetings should be presented on a regular basis to the Economic and Social Council , is likewise relevant to the provision of effective support to the Council in the exercise of its policy coordination functions .

The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,

It was in its endeavour to take up the challenge of providing these people with their basic minimum energy needs that the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , in a broad-based partnership with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , international organizations and concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations , launched in 1993 a global initiative : a three-year-long communication process known as the World Solar Summit Process .  
Moreover , it was based on several recognized criteria , among them the drawing of a baseline in a way not to depart to any appreciable extent , from the direction of the coast , and also the coastal State 's right to consider the economic interests peculiar to the region concerned , the reality and importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage . 
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially girls , children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , and children who are , in order to survive , forced to live and / or work in the streets .

The Committee , while recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the collection of data , is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to collect disaggregated data on the situation of all children , particularly those belonging to the most disadvantaged groups , including black children , disabled children , street children , children placed in institutions , including institutions of a penal nature , ill-treated and abused children or children from economically disadvantaged groups , which constitutes a major obstacle to the effective and full implementation of the provisions of the Convention .

The Committee is particularly concerned at the insufficient measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most vulnerable children , especially children who are victims of abuse , children of single parents , children born out of wedlock , abandoned children , disabled children , children living in poverty and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Instead , as can be seen in the conclusions that form the annex to the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly , the Working Groups identified selected areas in which to carry out a fair and impartial assessment of achievements over the past five years , and produced concrete and realistic recommendations to be implemented through cooperation and partnership among all the parties concerned .  
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action , taking into account internationally recognized norms and standards ;  
The right of option must be exercised within a reasonable period from the date of succession and must have no adverse consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their residence in the successor State or their movable or immovable property in that State - a new rule which derived from the progressive development of law and accorded with international human rights standards .  
In her country 's view , the right to self-determination meant the right of peoples to free themselves from colonialist oppression or foreign occupation , in accordance with the position stated by the Organization of African Unity that the colonial borders of African States should be left unaltered to avoid the risks of disintegration of the States concerned , the encouragement of insurrection and the disruption of international peace and security . 
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .

Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;

International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
With respect to working methods , his delegation supported the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should adopt a flexible approach involving both codification of international law ( inasmuch as fundamental human rights were involved ) and its progressive development ( as far as matters of succession of States were concerned ) .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .

Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often results in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .

The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,

Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
The Committee approved , on the basis of suggestions from the States concerned , a strictly limited number of road and rail border crossing points , which henceforth represented the exclusive transit points for passage of freight and rolling stock into and out of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( press releases SC / 5615 and SC / 5646 ) , monitored by national authorities in cooperation with the SAMs .

He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .

The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .

While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
The Commission decided to set up a working group composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the international instruments adopted by the States concerned .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
Linked to the creation of economic and commercial activities adapted to the various areas concerned , microeconomic and microfinance projects supported by the Agency and often carried out with the assistance of local bodies like Environmental Development Action in the Third World ( ENDA ) have had beneficial , rapid and lasting results . 
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;

The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
In preparation for its special session to review and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly , in paragraph 13 ( b ) of its resolution 50 / 113 of 20 December 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to prepare country profiles providing a concise presentation of progress made and constraints encountered in implementing Agenda 21 at the national level , compiled on the basis of national information received and in close cooperation with the Governments concerned . 
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,

Greatly concerned , the Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to request you to take appropriate preventive measures in order to halt the planned massive military assault which would inevitably entail the loss of many lives of the innocent civilian population .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Decides to renew , for a three-year period , the mandate of the Working Group composed of five independent experts entrusted with the task of investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by domestic courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned ;

Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities , Gravely concerned about reports that these practices have frequently been carried out by agents under government authority or have taken place with the knowledge of the Government of the Sudan ,  
Women are rarely appointed to these senior or influential positions and while their numbers may in some States be increasing at the lower levels and in posts usually associated with the home or the family , they form only a tiny minority in decision-making positions concerned with economic policy or development , political affairs , defence , peacemaking missions , conflict resolution or constitutional interpretation and determination .  
Consequently , it is the individual concerned , the citizen , who is fully entitled , directly or indirectly , to choose those who exercise the governmental , representative or legislative function , and who renews or withdraws his trust _ or rather his delegation of authority _ at predetermined intervals and in accordance with rules that protect his freedom of choice and punish any attempt to vitiate or divert it .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned . "  
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
The Committee was concerned about the low level of occupational achievement by educated women and male dominance in technical and professional fields , on the one hand , and the concentration of women in the lower-paid service sector , in particular the tourist industry , on the other .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,

International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .

It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
Concerted efforts are therefore required by all forces that believe in peace so as to thwart those hostile to peace and prepare on an urgent basis for the resumption of negotiations on all tracks in accordance with the terms of reference accepted by international consensus , approved by all the parties concerned without exception and based on the steps taken thus far with the blessing of the peoples of the region .

The responsibility for preventing involuntary displacement fell to the international community , which must also provide humanitarian and financial assistance to the affected countries , bearing in mind that such measures should be part of a comprehensive strategy to promote peace , security and economic and social development in the countries concerned .

Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .

I am seriously concerned by an increasing trend towards restrictive asylum policies in many Western countries , including rejection of asylum seekers at borders , interdiction at sea and the narrow interpretation of the refugee definition , including limiting to persecution by State actors .  The distinction between refugees and economic migrants in Western countries is sometimes difficult to establish in practical terms .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
At its organizational session , the Commission decided to include three substantive items on its 1997 agenda : item 4 Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; item 5 Fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ; and item 6 Guidelines on conventional arms control / limitation and disarmament , with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 N . Three Working Groups were established to deal with these agenda items . 
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
The mission focused on balancing real radiological risks against economic , social and psychological problems , and generating together with the authorities of the concerned countries realistic projects with a high likelihood of success , leading to measurable improvements in the current conditions under which the population was living .

The Republic of Korea reported that it had taken measures to ensure that no vessels entitled to fly its flag were engaged in fishing in areas under the jurisdiction of other States , unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State concerned .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
5 ) . the Secretary-General further stated that he " is therefore obliged to point out that unless Member States take early and effective action to reverse this trend , there will be no alternative to suspending even the reduced functions performed locally by the centres and closing their offices in the three capitals concerned " . 
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Other national legislation relevant to the regime governing the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes article 7 of the Civil Code concerning defamation , providing that upon decision of a court , the mass medium concerned and the officials or citizens responsible shall make compensation in the degree set by the court for moral ( non-property ) injury caused to a citizen as a result of the dissemination by the mass media of inaccurate information damaging to his honour , dignity or business reputation .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
The destiny of mankind , however contradictory and diverse , and the interests of nations and States may become more amenable to one common denominator , are increasingly concerned with the well-being of humanity , and display numerous convergent features which make it possible now to discuss the opportunity for a new international order .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .  
The thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , held in Harare in June this year , underscored the pressing need for democratizing the United Nations Security Council and stressed that the process should take full account of the position of Africa as the largest continental grouping at the United Nations as far as the allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in the reformed Council is concerned .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
Its adoption by the Assembly will send the correct and timely signal to the area that the international community is not indifferent to the peace process , but rather is most concerned about it and expects and demands a fair and judicious dealing by Israel in that process ; which currently should be under way . 
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea2 and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him , invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned , including Member States , in the elaboration of his report , and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Working together , the human rights community will make the United Nations human rights programme a programme of all people everywhere : strong , to prevent human rights violations ; reliable , to protect and defend victims ; interactive , to be shaped by all the actors concerned ; flexible , to react to evolving needs ; compelling , to build a worldwide Partnership for Human Rights .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Also requests the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization to extend appropriate assistance to Governments in designing and setting up programmes to encourage the creative , artistic and intellectual potential of children with disabilities , and through its regional offices , to conduct seminars and workshops to provide appropriate training in those fields to teachers , parents , social workers and others concerned ;  
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The principle that no one could possess two nationalities was no longer absolute because , due to common roots or historic ties between nations and the greater mobility of people , it was not always possible to avoid cases of double or multiple nationality without injustice to the persons concerned .  In addition , draft article 4 constituted a very useful saving clause : the presumption that acquisition of a new nationality automatically entailed loss of the former nationality was no longer generally respected .  
As the principal goal was to avoid statelessness , there could be a presumption of continuity of nationality or the acquisition of the nationality of one of the States concerned that would be based not on the sole criterion of habitual residence but on more factual criteria , particularly the universal criteria in international law of jus soli and jus sanguinis .  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
The Committee is deeply concerned by the institutionalized use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline , particularly in schools , as well as at the absence of a comprehensive law that clearly prohibits the use of both mental and physical torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against children .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .

Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;

I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,

The States of the Rio Group had reaffirmed that an integrated strategy to combat drugs should take into account the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon ; it was thus essential to implement social and regional development and substitution programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the rural families concerned . 
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 .

The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .

In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
In response to the comments of delegations , the Director stated that the High Commissioner was pursuing a cautious approach and was engaged in a consultative process with key partners and concerned donors and countries in the region , with a view to determining UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } response .

We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .

Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .

Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In that connection , he raised the issue of due recognition of such associations by the States concerned , based on an agreed set of rules designed , inter alia , to ensure their democratic functioning , transparency and , thus , overall credibility and legitimacy .  
By the Governments decision , the National Council for Womens Affairs , headed by a Cabinet member , the Minister for Health and Social Welfare , was established at the end of 1996 , and its operational by-laws were accordingly adopted . the Council is made up of MPs , officials of ministries concerned , representatives of womens non-governmental organizations , voluntary movements , mass organizations , owners of private companies , business and cooperative entities . 
Governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with women , youth and children carry out many activities aimed not only at preserving humane traditions practised in Mongolian families and inherited from our ancestors , including reverence and care of parents , support for the poor , and respect for elderly and pregnant women , but also at enriching them in new settings and passing them on to future generations . 
As far as his country was concerned , the efforts to reduce poverty and ensure social peace had been based on the plans of action formulated at the major United Nations conferences , and were aimed at achieving a form of development which reconciled growth and environmental protection , while ensuring a decent minimum income and the exercise of basic human rights for all citizens .  
A .

The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts , with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
A genuine commitment of all concerned parties at the national as well as the international level is needed to ensure a routine flow of reliable statistics and indicators at the country level , which meets national needs for information , and for the integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences and summits .  
In addition to the need to underscore , for all concerned , the key role that the quality of public information and communications activities plays in the effectiveness and success of peacekeeping operations in the field , the Department has developed cooperative mechanisms , enabling it to provide the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned departments with all the programmatic support necessary to undertake appropriate information programmes .  
The concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,

Welcomes :  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

It acknowledged the inherent complementarity between the refugee-specific mandate of UNHCR and the broader human rights mandates of other concerned agencies and institutions , and asserted the need to maintain the mutually supportive but separate character of their respective mandates .  
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Recalling that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad _ based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
Finally , he wished to stress the importance of maintaining the separate and distinct roles of internal and external oversight bodies as well as the need for oversight services not to duplicate their activities and to liaise closely in order to ensure smooth and efficient coverage of the organizations concerned .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,

Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
Affirms the need for technical cooperation programmes to be grounded in national developmental objectives of the countries concerned and to be aimed at supporting the achievement of national development goals , programmes and policies , in keeping with international human rights standards , utilizing , to the maximum extent possible , national expertise in human rights ;  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;

The aim of effective abolition of child labour contrary to accepted international standards , giving priority to immediate and concrete action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and to the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the children concerned , as well as to the search for alternatives to child labour and for a better socio _ economic environment to prevent child labour ;  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
On the other hand , several speakers agreed with the Secretary-Generals conclusion that a direct international radio broadcasting project would not be feasible until Member States and / or broadcast organizations concerned could provide the United Nations with the necessary budgetary and technical assistance .  
ACC agreed to encourage and reinforce cooperative arrangements which utilize flexible , pragmatic and differentiated approaches that are needs-driven , time-bound and bring together groups of concerned agencies around specific activities or programmes , designed to bring their respective comparative advantages into play to enhance effectiveness .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
While the former provide mainly statistical information and important economic and social indicators , the information gathered from the relevant academic literature , from non-governmental organizations and from the press tends , by its very nature , to be more critical of the political , economic and social conditions in the countries concerned .  
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
The Committee is concerned about the disparities of living standards , especially with regard to education , health , life expectancy , child mortality , access to piped water and electricity and employment , to be found between the prosperous north _ east coast of Tunisia and the underdeveloped north _ west , between the interior of the country and the south , and between the towns and rural areas .  
The concept of social protection must be incorporated into a comprehensive employment policy framework , which should be concerned not only about creating jobs in normal periods of steady economic growth , but also and very much about dealing with the consequences of rapid job loss during economic crises and periods of restructuring .  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .

Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Several Ministers stated that , while developing countries were generally encouraged by recent broad proposals on functioning of international financial markets and financing for development , they were concerned about the design of the initiatives to give effect to such proposals .  
On a reciprocal basis , States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings whereby , in relation to matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings in one or more States , the judicial authorities concerned may , where necessary together with police authorities and after informing the central authority or authorities referred to in paragraph 8 of this article , act jointly within joint investigation bodies .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
It was stressed , however , that prior to undertaking peacekeeping missions , every effort should be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .

He said : Proposals received since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee were broad in content .  They primarily concerned the following : Maintaining a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy ; strengthening agriculture and doing well in rural work ;  
Those responsible for primary party organizations must persistently follow the style of being truthful and realistic , waging a hard struggle , and working hard , establish themselves among the masses , be concerned about their weal and woe , put the interests of the party and the people above everything else , and , with enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility , lead the masses in striding toward an ever more prosperous future .

With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
As far as military strategy was concerned , the United States had adopted a new set of operational methods for high-technology limited warfare following the end of the cold war , but NATO 's operational methods and command systems had not departed completely from the operational approach designed for the prospect of fighting big battles with the Soviet Union . Therefore , there was a lack of coordination between them in the operations .

Under the new situation , all localities and departments concerned should act according to the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council , go all out to foster the new economic growth point - - the tourist industry , and ensure that it will achieve greater results in expanding domestic demand , increasing employment , promoting opening-up , stimulating local economic growth and social development , and will continue to play a comprehensive role in economic restructuring and in the development of other related industries .  
The above-mentioned " Opinion " points out : Over the past five decades following the founding of New China , especially since the start of reform and opening-up , the social welfare work in this country has made considerable progress and played a positive role in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .

Finally , the " Opinion " calls on local people 's governments at all levels and the departments concerned to make overall plans for developing social welfare undertakings , set reasonable work targets , and avoid such practices as acting arbitrarily , rushing headlong into mass action , making overlapping efforts , and wasting resources .  
Zeng Peiyan held : During the third session of the ninth National Committee of the CPPCC this year , CPPCC members posed some opinions and suggestions on the issue of the grand western development , which we highly valued .

The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .

In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Wang Yusheng said : Among all the biological events on earth , the most striking and most sensational events of biological extinction are actually not frightening and are very normal as far as the natural process of biological succession is concerned , because the new superseding the old is a general law of organic evolution .  
Therefore , acting in unison of a high degree with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is where the fundamental interests of our party and our people lie , and also where the future and the fate of our country and socialism lie .  Everyone who is concerned for the socialist cause and who has a firm ideal and conviction should have such a political consciousness .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .

At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .  
In order to protect the safety of some particularly important or vital economic targets which bear heavily on our national or regional security , aside from employing all sorts of passive or comprehensive protection measures , we must also more vigorously build an active air defense system by focusing on the issues concerned .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Sometimes , members of the party leading groups in the municipal people 's congress standing committee , the municipal government , and the CPPCC municipal committee , as well as comrades in relevant departments , are also invited to the meeting so that the collective decision made by the standing committee may give full consideration to the needs of all quarters concerned .  The fourth category is " implementation " .  After a decision is made by the standing committee , responsibilities are also made explicit .  
Standing committee members will take action to organize its implementation within the scope of their responsibilities .  The municipal party committee will supervise and inspect the implementation , and will coordinate and solve problems at a good time .  Thus , persistently integrating collective leadership with individual responsibility through the division of work plays a positive role in ensuring that the municipal party committee can effectively control the overall situation and coordinate the work of all quarters concerned when handling all major affairs of the whole city and acting as the core of leadership .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .

Guided by the central departments concerned , the Hong Kong Garrison persistently regarded studying or understanding the law as a basic project ; intensified both legal education and behavioral guidance ; and enabled both the articles and spirit of the Hong Kong Garrison Law to take root in the hearts of all the officers and men and become a conscious sense among them as well .  
On 4 December 1999 , the court of final appeal of the special administrative region unanimously gave the ruling that the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee is legal and in keeping with the constitution .

The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
With such a heroic spirit as " building a morale-boosting station " and " demonstrating national might " , the scientific research personnel concerned managed to pool wisdom and efforts of everyone and work hard with unreserved efforts and finally developed and built the first simulated satellite ground telecommunications station with China-made parts three months ahead of schedule .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?

For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .

The new century has only just begun , and with the surging tide of economic globalization , the new arms race about which people are continually concerned is exhibiting a growing momentum which is difficult to check .  It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for arms control .  This has cast a dark shadow over the world 's military security .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
Accordingly , although the missile problem is very complex , so long as there is a concerted effort by the concerned quarters in international society , by using political and diplomatic means and on the basis of equal dialogues and equal participation , the missile proliferation problem can be resolved in a fair , comprehensive , and non-discriminatory fashion .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .

Since Bush assumed office , it seems that the hardliners have gotten the upper hand as far as foreign policy is concerned .  They appear to be more and more presumptuous , not only to China , but other countries have also taken note of it .  Even European countries with friendly ties with the US are very displeased with the US for " repudiating " what many countries had agreed upon , and refusing to sign the Kyoto Accord which sets a limit to the emission of substances that are harmful to the ozone layer .  
- - US officials are not at all concerned about the missing Chinese pilot and the destroyed Chinese fighter , endlessly stressing instead : The EP-3 electronic reconnaisance plant is covered by US sovereignty , and the Chinese side can not send people to board the plane and still less carry out a search .  They also demand that China provide assistance for repairing the plane as soon as possible , so that the crew can fly back to base as soon as possible .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
Luo Gan demanded that the leading comrades of party committees and government at all levels and the departments concerned must further enhance understanding of the importance of comprehensive management of public order , and properly shoulder their political tasks of preserving social stability and keeping the country peaceful .

According to sources , the top level of the CPC was stunned and surprised by Bush 's challenging remarks , but believes for the time being that " a conclusion should only be drawn after the matter is investigated " ; the authorities will not lightly come to a conclusion before the entire matter is verified ; until the cards are clearly seen , the Beijing departments concerned will adopt an approach of " coolly observing the changes " regarding the US hardline policy on China .  
The priorities of priorities in educational development in minority areas are to introduce nine-year compulsory education and eliminate illiteracy among young people so as to promote the healthy and balanced development of all types of education .  All provinces and autonomous regions concerned must work harder at comprehensive planning as far as educational reform and development in minority areas are concerned .  First , rely on reform deepening .  
As far as the departments are concerned , in calculating how much money they can spend in the future , they do not take the budget for the previous year as the base figure but instead make decisions according to how many tasks they have ; if they have tasks to accomplish , they will have the money to spend , and if the tasks have been completed , their funds are cancelled accordingly ; thus we ensure that all expenditure goes on the crucial points in building the units .  
The Party 's Central Committee and the State Council place a high level of emphasis on these issues and are extremely concerned with safeguarding the lives of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and their re-employment .  They are speeding up implementation of social security system reform and have done a great deal of highly effective work to bring about the two ' guarantees ' ( guaranteeing the basic living expenses of workers laid off from state-owned enterprises and guaranteeing the on-time issue and proper amount of old age pensions for retired workers ) .  
should be resolved to turn more demonstration exercises into real training exercises , which may test and examine the units involved .  Whenever conditions allow , we should stage training exercises involving students from various military academies and schools , commanding officers from various units , and command organs from the units set to play a key role in such exercises , thus enabling all personnel concerned to handle the same situation together , and the general departments should organize and send personnel to examine and appraise training results .  
The current forum - - " Next Generation Asia " - - devoted to discussions on such issues as corporate management , competition advantages , information infrastructure construction , and electronic commerce , will be conducive to improving the management level of enterprises in Asia , promoting the development of the Asia economy , and benefiting all the parties concerned in seeking business opportunities .

An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
In the event that the provincial ( regional , and municipal ) and city party committees are unable to call such a plenary meeting , their standing committees may call a similar meeting to decide on the matter .  However , before deciding on the matter , the standing committees concerned should solicit views from the members of the party committees concerned .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
Recently , the Chinese Communists ' high-level departments concerned , including the Central Political Science and Law Group , have proclaimed that the campaign to suppress Falungong has achieved fruitful results at this stage , adding that this is entirely attributable to the central authorities ' decision plus the " decisive and resolute " action taken by the public security sector .

First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
We should not ignore concrete requirements and " minor issues " in the daily lives of the masses .  For instance , leaders should be concerned about whether the food provided in the canteens at grassroots units is satisfactory or not , whether officers and soldiers have already observed their due holidays or not , whether problems in employment and education of their dependents have been solved or not .  
For example , insofar as fighting opportunities are concerned , a belligerent will have to strike at the enemy at its weak points , with unusual tactics , at a time , in a zone , and in a way detrimental to the enemy , thereby rendering it impossible for the enemy to concentrate its " capability " within a short period of time .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
A division of Jinan Military Area Command regarded strengthening the leadership over ideological and political work as an important responsibility of party committees .  In light of the rapid development in the international and domestic situations as well as with frequent occurrence of crucial issues , this division promptly analyzed the ideological trend of the military , and adhered to the system according to which leading cadres give reports on the situation , answer questions that officers and soldiers are generally concerned about and use decisions made by the party Central Committee to unite thinking .  
On the basis of this training and with the guidance of departments concerned under the fleet , they made bold efforts in giving up the previous drill pattern of " hitting dead targets . "  Instead , they used mobile target ships that can change direction and speed to simulate the movement of " enemy " ships .  As a result , they have greatly enhanced the difficulty in military drills .  
While talking about the issue that the party 's leading collective of the third generation has been concerned about the causes of foreign trade and economic cooperation , Shi Guangsheng said with deep emotion that the farsighted and accurate policy decisions of the party Central Committee are the fundamental reason why the cause of foreign trade and economic cooperation is growing more and more prosperous .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .

It comprehensively summed up the glorious course and basic experiences of the party , systematically expounded the important concept of " three represents , " explicitly set the basic requirements of strengthening and improving party building , and profoundly answered major theoretical and practical questions of fundamental importance with a bearing on the overall situation , about which people had been concerned .  
The departments concerned of the governments at all levels , especially the agriculture-related departments , should under the unified leadership of Party committees and in the light of the actual conditions in their own departments and own systems effect active coordination to carry out well the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas .  
The responsible comrades of the Party committees and governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , members of the for the joint conference on the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas , and others respectively attended the teleconference at branch meeting places in localities concerned .  
Third , efforts must be made to maintain the country 's long-term peace and stability by taking further steps to ensure fiscal outlays for public security organs , procuratorial organs , people 's courts , judicial departments and other law-enforcement organs , giving positive assistance to the departments concerned in strengthening the comprehensive improvement of public order , energetically consolidating economic order in the marketplace and strictly cracking down on major crimes .  
Positive steps should be taken to centralize and hand over the power of managing teachers ' wages to the county authorities in conjunction with measures adopted by the departments concerned to carefully verify the authorized number and total payroll of rural primary and secondary school teachers .  " Special wage fund accounts " should be set up in all counties in accordance with regulations to ensure that rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid fully and on time .  The supervision and management of outlays for teachers ' pay should also be strengthened .  
The party , government , military , and civilian must pool their efforts , coordinate closely , and expand in a deep and sustained way the advertisement of the " National Defense Education Law " , creating a fine social atmosphere that all people will focus on , be concerned with , and support .

The formulation by people 's governments and concerned departments of people 's governments at city or prefecture ( to include cities with independent planning authority and sub-province level cities ) , county , or town or township level , of standard fees to be collected by state administrative organizations is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
2 .  The formulation by concerned organizations of people 's governments at province level of standard fees to be collected which have not been reviewed and approved by planning , pricing , and finance organizations is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
They should make up their mind to eliminate the predominant problems that are currently existing with their leadership style ; start from issues that are most sensitive to the troops , issues that are of most concerned to the officers and men at the basic level , as well as issues that are most apt to impair the image of leaders ; and establish a sound image of taking the lead in practicing the thinking of " three represents . "  
On the afternoon of the 17th , Beijing Municipality held its first Mayoral Office meeting since the successful Olympics bid , where it studied the high-tech industrial development plan drawn up by the concerned departments for the " 10th Five Year Plan " and the three-year urban public transportation development plan .  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
At this jubilant moment , we would like to extend festival congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the army and the armed police force , the militiamen and the reserves , cordial regards to retired old cadres , demobilized servicemen , disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs , who have made outstanding contribution to the building of the people 's army , and high respect to people of all ethnic groups across the country who are concerned about and support national defense and army building ! 
The fact that after being elected prime minister Koizumi insisted on stating that he would pay respects at the shrine , heedless of domestic opposition and external protests , shows not only his individual political attitude but is also an expression of the swelling growth of rightist forces in society , and people should be particularly concerned about this .  
As for which direction Japan is likely to move under Junichiro Koizumi 's leadership , we may view things from the following two aspects : First , insofar as domestic reform is concerned , Japan is expected to meet strong resistance and a host of difficulties , first and foremost , from Junichiro Koizumi 's Liberal Democratic Party , and thus , whether Japan 's reform can succeed and meet the Japanese people 's expectations is bound to have a direct bearing on the Junichiro Koizumi Administration ;  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .  
Zhu Rongji said , the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very concerned for Guizhou 's economic and social development ; we hope that the provincial party committee and government will seriously implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " and lead the people of all nationalities in the province to work with concerted efforts , engage in pioneering and innovation , and speed up the building of a beautiful new Guizhou with prosperous economy , social progress , and people of all ethnic groups living in harmony .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
It was revealed that the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . discovered that its major shareholders and the parties concerned had misappropriated a huge amount of funds , equivalent to 96 percent of its listed net assets , even more than what some major shareholders had misappropriated from " ST Monkey King " during a period of many years .  In this astonishing case , it can be said , the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . has set a vicious example for major shareholders and the parties concerned to misappropriate funds from a listed company .  
With a huge amount of funds misappropriated by major shareholders and the parties concerned , a listed company is expected to find itself lacking in reserve strength in seeking development , and entering a strange circle in the end , namely , " outstanding performance in the first year , acceptable performance in the second year , and poor performance in the third year . "  
Many localities have conducted thorough investigation and study and practiced effective contacts and coordination with the departments concerned , acted in light of local conditions , ensured the quality of work , and accumulated many experiences in the course of building grassroots drugs supervision and control organs .

Regarding the request made to the NPC to interpret the law , the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners who are truly concerned about Hong Kong have come to realize that had the SAR Government not promptly requested the NPC to interpret the law , 1.6 million mainlanders would have rushed into Hong Kong , causing tremendous unbearable impact on Hong Kong 's basic human rights , including rights in the areas of housing , education , medical service , and social order .  
China 's negotiations with various countries on its WTO accession are raging on like wild fires .  As far as China is concerned , to be able to join the WTO naturally would be like winning a trade war , but the problem today is the arduous tasks the country will be facing after its WTO accession .

and eventually enable its government revenue to pick up and rise .  Insofar as international experiences are concerned , the United States began to reduce spending , enhance efficiency , increase scientific and technological investment , and consolidate its foundation and reinforce its internal strength in the 1990s and has attained excellent results .  However , Japan has chosen to raise taxes without reducing public spending with the result that the Japanese economy has stagnated .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
But nuclear deterrence can never reach the fringe territories and the hot zones where the major powers ' interests overlap , and as far as the medium-sized and small countries are concerned , war is still an effective political means , and because their instruments of war are relatively simple , wars that erupt in those regions are still going to be traditional wars , and the modes of combat are still going to be the traditional forms of anti-personnel firepower .  
In the face of the complicated Middle East situation , China always has maintained that the countries concerned should truly implement the relevant UN resolution and abide by the principle of " exchanging land for peace . "  In accordance with the spirit of respecting history , facing reality and having their eyes on the future , they should conduct peace talks in an unremitting , flexible and pragmatic way so that the long-drawn-out Middle East problem can be resolved in an all-round , just and thorough way .  
In fact , since the Falungong organization was banned , a number of suspected Falungong followers have gone to certain public places in Beijing and attempted to hold illegal assemblies there ; the departments concerned have advised these people to leave or have taken them back to their homes ; this has happened about 35,000 person-times , and it is not the case that 35,000 people have been arrested , as stated by Falungong 's overseas organizations .

Although mainland China 's initial responses are far from friendly , you still keep calling on them to make a rational choice . I think the people are most concerned with the question of when conditions may become ripe . What I mean is that given your understanding and knowledge of the world situation and the political developments in mainland China , when do you think conditions will become ripe for talks between the two sides as equals ? Thank you , Mr . President .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution .

Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world .

Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back .

All of them are impossible to imitate because of " innate limits . "  
Lin Yu-wen has been supervising Chan meditation for ten years and says it is because some people get the wrong teachers and get involved in a mysterious kind of " crazy Chan " that they are not concerned with morality and even cut themselves off from society .

First of all , father became much more clearheaded and even his extra workload could not ruffle his calm tranquility .

We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs .

Such painting for the scientific record was concerned primarily with seeking factual truth . When tools were developed to aid in the appreciation of nature and ecological research took off , conservationism swept the world and the number of bird watchers increased daily . Scientific illustrations were produced in great quantities and the demands of the art market gave rise to the ecological art of today .  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
In 1989 the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed . Besides being concerned about Taiwan 's image , the Council of Agriculture , which is responsible for ecological preservation work , is even more worried that the mountains are being scarred by ever-larger development projects , which are destroying the habitat of wild animals . It is feared that this destruction of habitat , combined with the Chinese belief that monkey brain is especially fortifying in the winter , will make the Formosan Rock Monkey an endangered species .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Doing away with stereotypes : As far as Chang Hsiao-hung is concerned , postmodern game stratagems , or as she terms it , " gender performance , " can lend feminism new vitality and allow it to adapt to complex , changing postmodern culture . Madonna personifies the complexities , contradictions , and ambiguities of postmodern culture . Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
It may sound odd , but here it is : Although the Nien genealogy clearly states that they are descended from the Jurchen , as far as the people of the Nien Clan Village are concerned , being identified as the heirs of Ahguda seems only to have occasional symbolic meaning , with little substantive impact .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
Yet there is a sharp contrast . Japanese media have long been concerned about cross-strait relations , have deep understanding of the situation , and handled stories in a low-key fashion . US reports , on the other hand , tended to be more provocative and intense ; US reports also used more varied sources and had a more international perspective .  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
But from the point of view of international goodwill and the natural reaction most people have toward anything nuclear , it might have been best to give more attention to the issues raised by concerned observers . For example , Michael Kau , a scholar at Brown University in the US , and Fang Chien , a well-known environmental activist , pointed out that no one wants nuclear waste in their back yard , and disregarding the sentiments of a neighbor does not conform to Chinese ethics .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
" It is really wonderful that such a rich , perfect thing can appear before all our eyes through the meticulous process of organizing , recording and production . And this clarity is not just a clarity of theory , but also an emotional clarity , between just this person and just this piece of music , here and now . Even in the present age , when tradition is in decline , a concerned person wo n't be lonely at all , but will rejoice at his or her own personal good fortune . "  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
Seeing that many Han Chinese appear to be so concerned about surveying and recording aboriginal culture , Wu has , over the past two years , begun trying to collate and systematize aboriginal culinary culture . She has already identified and recorded more than 100 varieties of wild edible plants . The most able to " eat bitterness " Wu notes that most wild vegetables are bitter .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
Many victims who had already escaped from a dangerous structure went back inside when they heard the telephone ringing . They were concerned that a relative calling might be worried if no one answered the phone . After the earthquake , love for family members actually posed a danger to them .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
In the early years of ROC rule in Taiwan , the government sent political prisoners to Green Island . Those inmates lucky enough to survive that era of oppression and return to their normal lives , as well as family members of prisoners and other citizens concerned about human rights , joined together to create the foundation . So that the suffering of that period would not be forgotten , they raised money to establish this memorial , which bears witness to the government 's past mistakes and the pain of those who suffered under its oppression .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle-aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man . Society was shocked from top to bottom .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
This cultural illness is particularly serious in United States .

They should be less concerned with a wayward appearance than with trying to understand and deal with underlying causes , because once these are taken care of the rest will follow .

Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .

Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents " .  
The Government of Cuba is concerned that , despite relevant resolutions adopted in recent years by the General Assembly on the use of coercive economic measures against developing countries , which provide a clear mandate , the United Nations Secretariat has still not identified specific activities within the medium-term plan and programme budget for the proper implementation of those decisions .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents " .  
Where it is itself directly concerned , the Russian Federation is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and the freedom of international trade and navigation as mentioned in resolution 49 / 9 , and continues to support normal trade and economic relations with Cuba based on common interest and mutual benefit .  
We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
Each treatment programme is tailored to the local situation and to the needs of the victims and their families ; they are based on a comprehensive approach dealing with all the problems resulting from torture ( medical , psychological , social and economic problems ) , and taking account of the family , social and occupational environment of the individual concerned .

NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
NULLAs far as the situation in southern Sudan is concerned , hundreds of thousands of children continue to live in insecurity in the conflict zones , in danger of being abducted , exposed to lasting psychological trauma , or living in inappropriate conditions .  
In practical terms , this means raising the level of consciousness about the problem at both the global and the national levels , stimulating dialogue among all concerned and facilitating cooperation between national and international actors .  
Both objectives fulfil a catalytic role by raising the level of consciousness among the pertinent actors , generating functional dialogue with all concerned and fostering a collaborative process involving the primary responsibility of the Government and the complementary or supplementary role of the international community .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
His delegation was therefore pleased that the Commission had decided to refer to the Drafting Committee only the articles concerned with aggression , genocide , systematic or mass violations of human rights , and exceptionally serious war crimes ; that decision demonstrated that the Commission was directing its work towards a realistic , rather than a political concept of crimes against the peace and security of mankind .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .

Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Another concerned the proposed function of the International Court of Justice : assuming that it continued to operate in its current manner , was the Court suited to make the final decision with regard to the existence of an international crime and would it be able to respond quickly enough to an international crime which was being committed by a State ?  
In the Cairo Agenda for Action adopted by the OAU Council of Ministers at its seventeenth extraordinary session , held at Cairo in March 1995 , which concerned " Relaunching African economic and social development " , industrial development was highlighted as being central to structural change and to transformation of African economies .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .

Along with the rest of the international community , her Government had been appalled by the callous treatment of vulnerable groups in that area and continued to be concerned about the fate of missing persons within the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the indications that mass executions might have taken place .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Very often the economic model on which structural adjustment programmes are based has made it impossible to overcome the particularly serious social problems of the countries concerned , especially poverty , and in some cases has increased the concentration of wealth , exclusion and marginalization .  
The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
Deeply concerned about the critical economic and social situation prevailing in Angola , aggravated by the tremendous consequences of war which have destroyed the economic and social infrastructure ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
In post-emergency situations , a group which often became a major liability and risk to the precarious peace process was that of soldiers who had to be demobilized and prepared for reintegration into civil society ; that task posed formidable challenges to be addressed jointly with the United Nations system and other concerned parties . 
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,

concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights field operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,

Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular , the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes with a time-frame for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;

concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
Faced with the rapid internationalization of organized crime and the rise in urban crime , violent crime and juvenile delinquency , every country was concerned with safety , which was essential for the sustained development of society .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Obligations for personal services established in the current biennium shall be valid for the succeeding biennium , provided that appointments of the experts concerned are effected by the end of the current biennium and that the total period to be covered by obligations established for these purposes against the resources of the current biennium does not exceed 24 months ;  
The Government of Sri Lanka had endeavoured to reduce to the absolute minimum the hardships forced on the peoples concerned , and to that end it had taken steps to ensure that they received food , medicine and other essential items without interruption and in sufficient quantities , although the aforementioned secessionist group was diverting a substantial part of that assistance for its own war effort .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The strengthening of the role of the Organization , both in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of the fundamental objective of economic and social development , had to be logically dependent on the participation , on an equal footing , of all Member States which , whether big or small , were all equally sovereign and equally concerned with the destiny of the Organization .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
Although the international community has succeeded , by dint of serious negotiations , in resolving many difficult problems and has achieved important results in many sensitive areas through the establishment of the World Trade Organization , we are still concerned by the continuing practice of trade protectionism , which runs counter to our belief in the importance of allowing market forces to play their natural role in economic affairs .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
a more practical , attainable peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interests of all concerned .  
The application of the kind of measures referred to in the draft resolution introduced today by the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya not only represents an attack on the identity of the State concerned and on its political , economic and cultural elements , but also affects other sensitive areas such as the ability of the peoples suffering from those unilateral policies fully to enjoy their human rights .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
My specific proposal is to suggest that the Fifth Committee , after adoption of the draft resolution by the Main Committee concerned on the basis of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , will take note of the estimate of additional requirements contained in the programme budget implications , on the understanding that such additional appropriation as may be necessary will be determined in the context of a revised appropriation , taking into account all relevant information , including the performance report .  
Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon , which I welcome , I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and , especially , a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
I wish to recall that Australia supported resolution 50 / 70 F . We are concerned to ensure that SSOD IV is scheduled in such a way that it has adequate time to prepare and the best possible story to tell for example , to report a successfully concluded comprehensive test-ban treaty , and that the meeting itself provides a forward-looking framework for future concrete disarmament undertakings . 
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
UNESCO , in close collaboration with national authorities concerned and international institutions such as ITC , will continue to monitor selected cultural sites inscribed in the World Heritage List , using remote sensing methods and GIS .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
Note that , as far as education systems are concerned , basic education is the only appropriate way of meeting fundamental educational needs and enabling every individual to become a real participant in society and an effective and responsible participant in the economic , social and cultural development of his or her country ;  
Other initiatives which his delegation was presenting to the General Assembly at the current session concerned the protection of minorities , which called for enhanced international cooperation to defuse conflict situations ; attention to the specific needs of children and juveniles in conflict with the law in the context of human rights in the administration of justice ; and the plight of internally displaced persons , in respect of which the work of the Secretary-General 's representative on that question had been crucial .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
The proper way to respond to attitudes of reservation regarding religious freedom was through patient and resolute dialogue , based on facts and the participation of all parties concerned , operating in the framework of internationally established norms and seeking to determine possible action and to plan for the longer term .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
In any case in which award of compensation has been made by the Tribunal in favour of the person concerned and the Committee has requested an advisory opinion under paragraph 2 of this article , the Secretary-General , if satisfied that such person will otherwise be handicapped in protecting his interests , shall within fifteen days of the decision to request an advisory opinion make an advance payment to him of one third of the total amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal less such termination benefits , if any , as have already been paid .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
In addition , we are very concerned about the continued UNITA military activity in some regions of the country , in a pattern of military movement without prior notification to UNAVEM III and of isolated attacks and ambushes against civilian and military targets alike , almost always resulting in a loss of human life . 
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , have expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by sixteen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,

The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .

Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .

Deeply concerned that , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life , the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person , the right to freedom of expression , the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained ,  
Deeply concerned about the critical economic and social situation prevailing in Angola , aggravated by the tremendous consequences of war which have destroyed the economic and social infrastructure ,  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,

International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .

We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
To that end , the concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
It is useful to distinguish between ( a ) supply management , seeking a supply adequate for a set of water needs and including the traditional activities required to locate , develop , and exploit existing and new sources of water , and ( b ) demand management , concerned with the ways in which water is allocated and used , the socio-economic and environmental effects of that use , and the various tools available to promote more desirable levels and patterns of use .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III .

At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .

Both at the eighth ministerial meeting at Yaound and at the Bureau meeting at Brazzaville , it was felt that while the primary responsibility for resolving the political and security problems in the Central African subregion rested with the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned , concerted action at the subregional and wider levels was required to promote lasting solutions .  
It called for an effective regional institutional mechanism to provide for a harmonized approach to transit transport matters , and it urged all concerned international and regional organizations to strengthen their activities which promoted regionally adopted legal and administrative solutions that facilitated regional and international transport and trade .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .

To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
" Deeply concerned about the significant decline in resources allocated to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , the incomplete tenth replenishment of the International Development Association and prospects for the eleventh replenishment at significantly reduced real levels , which has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in pursuing collaboration and their role in the field of development ,

A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .

The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
Three main problems were identified : virtually all ministries lack qualified personnel at appropriate levels to expedite externally assisted projects ; bureaucratic obstacles on the part of the Government - but also on the part of the donors - retard and even impede project implementation ; lack of coordination among donors in some sectors leads to excessive demands on the time of the Minister concerned and already overworked ministerial staff who are at times obliged to analyse and choose among similar projects presented by different donors .  
With the increased level of insecurity producing newly displaced persons daily , the United Nations system remains concerned that current stockpiles will be depleted and major shortages of essential relief items will soon occur .  
Where funding is concerned , the State has made a major effort to provide researchers with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the research freely chosen by them in the scientific councils of the establishment or those to which they belong ( national mobilization programmes ) ; the resources are decided upon by scientific commissions and approved by the administrative authority .  Thus the public research budget , which was only 32.9-million dinars in 1992 , had increased by 1995 to 57.9-million dinars .

Moreover , it was based on several recognized criteria , among them the drawing of a baseline in a way not to depart to any appreciable extent , from the direction of the coast , and also the coastal State 's right to consider the economic interests peculiar to the region concerned , the reality and importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage . 
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,

The right of option must be exercised within a reasonable period from the date of succession and must have no adverse consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their residence in the successor State or their movable or immovable property in that State - a new rule which derived from the progressive development of law and accorded with international human rights standards .  
In her country 's view , the right to self-determination meant the right of peoples to free themselves from colonialist oppression or foreign occupation , in accordance with the position stated by the Organization of African Unity that the colonial borders of African States should be left unaltered to avoid the risks of disintegration of the States concerned , the encouragement of insurrection and the disruption of international peace and security . 
Subsequently , as the industrial base of the country in the industry concerned is developed and capabilities are acquired , the domestic sector may be exposed to import competition through gradual trade liberalization .

The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often results in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of , and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
As to the new proposal regarding the relationship between the future framework convention and existing bilateral or multilateral watercourse agreements , it was his understanding that the draft articles were intended to provide a general framework of rules and principles that would be applicable to future watercourse agreements among concerned watercourse States . The omission from the current draft articles of any reference to existing agreements was not accidental , but the result of a decision taken by the International Law Commission which his delegation fully supported .  
The Committee approved , on the basis of suggestions from the States concerned , a strictly limited number of road and rail border crossing points , which henceforth represented the exclusive transit points for passage of freight and rolling stock into and out of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( press releases SC / 5615 and SC / 5646 ) , monitored by national authorities in cooperation with the SAMs .  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism , and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him and invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned in the elaboration of his report and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action , taking into account internationally recognized norms and standards ;  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
To introduce free secondary education and offer financial assistance in case of need , indicating the children concerned , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , and national , social and ethnic origin , and the budget allocated for that purpose ;  
Relevant information should also be provided on the progress achieved in the implementation of article 40 , any difficulties encountered and targets set for the future , as well as disaggregated data on the children concerned , inter alia by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , offence and disposition made available .  
Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
" Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him and invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned , including Member States , in the elaboration of his report and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
" Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a land-locked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned at the widespread and disastrous consequences of the economic sanctions imposed against Burundi for the national economy , public finances and agricultural production and for the health and the education , at all levels , of its population ,  
China is ready to work with the countries concerned in accordance with the established basic principles and legal regime , as contained in recognized international law and contemporary law of the sea including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to achieve an appropriate settlement of disputes through peaceful negotiations . 
However , the Special Rapporteur is essentially concerned with violations of international human rights law , that is the victim must not be penalized , physical integrity must not be violated and violence as defined by the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women must be prohibited and punished .  
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
The Panel , while considering the merits of the application of bottom-up approaches along with top-down approaches , involving all major groups concerned with the issues , emphasized the need for national action programmes to draw more extensively on local and traditional knowledge and agro-sylvopastoral systems , in accordance with guiding principles as outlined in programme element I . 3 . 
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .  
Deeply concerned about the rising level of crime in many parts of the world , jeopardizing political stability and the internal and external security of States , his country supported the draft United Nations framework convention against organized crime submitted by Poland ( A / C . 3 / 51 / 7 ) , and other relevant initiatives . 
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
The Commission decided to set up a working group composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the international instruments adopted by the States concerned .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
In resolution 1996 / 75 , the Commission , concerned at the situation of women and children , especially regarding access to basic education for girl children and access by women to employment , called upon all parties in Afghanistan to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and also called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , economic , political and cultural life throughout the country and to ensure equal treatment to women and girls .  
It is true that the Rules are not legally binding , but the way in which they were elaborated in close cooperation between numerous Governments and the community of major international non-governmental organizations , should foster a strong commitment on the part of all parties concerned to promote their implementation .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
Linked to the creation of economic and commercial activities adapted to the various areas concerned , microeconomic and microfinance projects supported by the Agency and often carried out with the assistance of local bodies like Environmental Development Action in the Third World ( ENDA ) have had beneficial , rapid and lasting results . 
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
Indeed , it is in recognition of the critical importance of the success of this peace process to achieve durable peace in the Middle East that Japan has been actively participating in the peace process by engaging in intensified dialogue with the parties directly concerned , by sending its own contingents to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region , and by offering its active contribution to the multilateral talks on the Middle East launched in Madrid in 1991 .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Communications under the 1503 procedure are admissible only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they may reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; any replies received from the Governments concerned must be taken into account . 
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
The Committee was also concerned that the country had not made much real progress in implementing the Convention and that , despite its efforts , it had yet to respond effectively to problems such as domestic violence , prostitution , early pregnancy , female illiteracy , discrimination in the workplace in terms of how much women were paid , the high percentage of women receiving less than the minimum wage , the elimination of stereotypes , and the changes that needed to be made in the country 's legal system , which reinforced existing stereotypes .  
It is recognized , however , that the responsibility for coordinating external assistance , from multilateral , bilateral or other international organizations , rests first and foremost with the Government concerned .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Also welcomes the innovative approach and close cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the International Organization for Migration and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in initiating and supporting a multilateral constructive dialogue among a wide range of countries concerned that has brought agreement on guidelines for practical action ;  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
While some support was expressed for modifying the article as suggested , one view was that the article should be deleted because it either stated what applied anyway or because it was not for a ( model ) national statute to deal with matters that concerned the hierarchy among legislative acts , an issue that had constitutional implications .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
While maintaining a war mentality in the vain hope of crushing the rebels in the field ( and thereby nullifying any attempt to begin the negotiations which Major Buyoya has himself advocated ) the Burundi de facto authorities are systematically resettling rural populations using an outdated strategy of forced villagization , whose weaknesses and the suffering entailed for the populations concerned have been demonstrated in other conflicts , particularly in Viet Nam . 
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State .

The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .

Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level .

It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .

I am seriously concerned by an increasing trend towards restrictive asylum policies in many Western countries , including rejection of asylum seekers at borders , interdiction at sea and the narrow interpretation of the refugee definition , including limiting to persecution by State actors .

Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .

Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;

If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,

Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
The destiny of mankind , however contradictory and diverse , and the interests of nations and States may become more amenable to one common denominator , are increasingly concerned with the well-being of humanity , and display numerous convergent features which make it possible now to discuss the opportunity for a new international order .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .  
The thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , held in Harare in June this year , underscored the pressing need for democratizing the United Nations Security Council and stressed that the process should take full account of the position of Africa as the largest continental grouping at the United Nations as far as the allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in the reformed Council is concerned .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
Its adoption by the Assembly will send the correct and timely signal to the area that the international community is not indifferent to the peace process , but rather is most concerned about it and expects and demands a fair and judicious dealing by Israel in that process ; which currently should be under way . 
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
These obstacles include the difficult legacy of the past , contradictory legislation and regulations , administrative delays due to conflicts of interest , differing conceptions of economic and social development , ineffective consultation with the populations concerned , notably on the use of territorial resources , and finally endemic violence .  
As regards future prospects , the Government of Russia recalled the importance of combined efforts of concerned States and international organizations and called for steps to raise standards in human rights and minorities protection , to consolidate civil society and national harmony and promote tolerance and mutual respect among all strata of the population - ultimately for the good of democracy , the supremacy of law , and stability .

At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
Calls upon States to take the responsibility , consistent with their obligations under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea2 and resolution 49 / 116 , to take measures to ensure that no fishing vessels entitled to fly their national flags fish in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized by the competent authorities of the coastal State or States concerned ; such authorized fishing operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in the authorization ;  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .

Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
The problem remained unsolved until external factors triggered spiralling resentment that was exploited by the elements concerned : the arrival of the Rwandan refugees in 1994 and its consequences , namely , imported violence , the international protection extended even to those guilty of genocide , environmental damage and the preferential treatment of refugees fed latent anti-Rwandan feelings . 
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Approves the methods of work employed by the Special Rapporteur , in particular as regards urgent appeals , reiterates his need to be able to respond effectively to credible and reliable information that comes before him , invites him to continue to seek the views and comments of all concerned , including Member States , in the elaboration of his report , and expresses its appreciation of the continuing discrete and independent way in which he carries out his work ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by seventeen years of war , and stressing the importance of a return to peace and stability for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least developed and war-stricken country ,  
Some States expressed the view that under the current legal system , there was no special regime that distinguished take-off and landing phases , but in the case of passage over the territorial airspace of another State after entry into airspace , international and national air law of relevant States could apply , in particular in relation to the sovereignty and security of the State concerned .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Even though it is more complete than article 47 of Additional Protocol I , it does not differ much from that text as far as the definition of a mercenary is concerned and it lends itself to different and perhaps contradictory interpretations , when it is States themselves that , on the initiative of their Governments , hire private firms to perform services connected with public order and security . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Working together , the human rights community will make the United Nations human rights programme a programme of all people everywhere : strong , to prevent human rights violations ; reliable , to protect and defend victims ; interactive , to be shaped by all the actors concerned ; flexible , to react to evolving needs ; compelling , to build a worldwide Partnership for Human Rights .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Also requests the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization to extend appropriate assistance to Governments in designing and setting up programmes to encourage the creative , artistic and intellectual potential of children with disabilities , and through its regional offices , to conduct seminars and workshops to provide appropriate training in those fields to teachers , parents , social workers and others concerned ;  
We are concerned to see the Israeli authorities continuing to commit certain acts that are intended to change the Holy City 's demographic and institutional character in order to Judaize Arab Jerusalem and alter its legal , historical , religious and cultural reality .  
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
This includes , inter alia , the right , individually and in association with others , to submit to governmental bodies and agencies and organizations concerned with public affairs , criticism and proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work which may hinder or impede the promotion , protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
The principle that no one could possess two nationalities was no longer absolute because , due to common roots or historic ties between nations and the greater mobility of people , it was not always possible to avoid cases of double or multiple nationality without injustice to the persons concerned .  In addition , draft article 4 constituted a very useful saving clause : the presumption that acquisition of a new nationality automatically entailed loss of the former nationality was no longer generally respected .  
As the principal goal was to avoid statelessness , there could be a presumption of continuity of nationality or the acquisition of the nationality of one of the States concerned that would be based not on the sole criterion of habitual residence but on more factual criteria , particularly the universal criteria in international law of jus soli and jus sanguinis .  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
It was therefore deeply concerned about the situation in the occupied territories where the Palestinians continued to be deprived of their basic human rights such as access to education , natural resources and land ownership , further hindering a just and comprehensive settlement and seriously undermining the spirit of trust and cooperation vital to the success of the peace process .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
The Committee is deeply concerned by the institutionalized use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline , particularly in schools , as well as at the absence of a comprehensive law that clearly prohibits the use of both mental and physical torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against children .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
The international community and States should take all the necessary measures to protect the rights of vulnerable segments of the population and give very serious consideration to holding a large _ scale discussion on the practice of embargoes and economic sanctions which are imposed on States and have adverse consequences for the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights of the segments concerned ;  
Also deeply concerned about the rising illicit cultivation of narcotic crops and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs , which pose the main threat to the political , economic , social and cultural structure and stability of the region ,  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
The States of the Rio Group had reaffirmed that an integrated strategy to combat drugs should take into account the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon ; it was thus essential to implement social and regional development and substitution programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the rural families concerned . 
In conclusion , since environmental concerns found expression in diametrically opposite ways depending on economic situations and the geographical location of the countries concerned , efforts by the international community would become effective only when there was an emphasis on the human dimension of the consequences of environmental changes , which should be fully reflected in the post-1997 phase of implementation of Agenda 21 . 
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a Member of the United Nations and a concerned State , while reiterating the principle of the inalienable right of States to choose their political , social , cultural and economic systems , calls upon the Member States to resist such unlawful actions and to make every effort to eliminate their adverse impacts ; and thus preserve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular those pertaining to national sovereignty , political independence , territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States .  
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
The competence of the Tribunal may also be extended , with the approval of the General Assembly , to any other international organization or entity established by a treaty and participating in the common system of conditions of service , upon the terms set out in a special agreement between the organization or entity concerned and the Secretary-General of the United Nations .  
In view of the continued conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan and the stalemated efforts to involve all the parties concerned in constructive and viable political dialogue , on 29 July , I appointed Mr . Lakhdar Brahimi as my Special Envoy on a short mission to consult interested and relevant countries and parties , as well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference , and to present a comprehensive review of the United Nations peacemaking activities in Afghanistan . 
The centres would develop train the trainer programmes to train peace promoters in the region concerned and to monitor and support their peace promotion work on a long-term basis , producing ultimately a diverse and flexible network of peace promoters around the world , connected by modern communication technology , for the exchange of information and experience in building a culture of peace at the local and regional level .  
The commitment made at Copenhagen to eradicate poverty in the world also called for action at the international level to ensure that policies and programmes will advance the attainment of agreed developmental goals that are aimed at meeting basic needs for all and eradicating absolute poverty ; the participation of the people concerned is an integral part in this endeavour .  
Invites the regional commissions , the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , government-appointed national correspondents in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice , specialized agencies and other entities within the United Nations system , the intergovernmental organizations concerned and relevant non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to become actively involved in the preparations for the Tenth Congress ;  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
In response to the comments of delegations , the Director stated that the High Commissioner was pursuing a cautious approach and was engaged in a consultative process with key partners and concerned donors and countries in the region , with a view to determining UNHCR \ x { e5b8 } response .  
These unresolved conflicts undermine the political , economic and social fabric of the States concerned , bringing destruction and untold human suffering to the victims of war .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
Furthermore , UNHCR emphasized that an essential condition for the prevention of involuntary mass movements is adequate political will on the part of the States directly concerned , and by the international community as a whole .  
It was of great importance that the concluding observations be widely published and made accessible by the States parties concerned in domestic languages and distributed to the relevant national authorities .  
Wide areas such as rules of origin in autonomous or contractual preferential agreements remain , as far as the multilateral system is concerned , under soft law regulations and not guided by common disciplines .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
The Czech Republic is convinced that the necessary prerequisite for an effective anti-drug action , on the domestic and international level , is the political will of each State concerned .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
Confidential material so classified by the coastal State shall remain confidential after consideration of the submission is concluded unless decided otherwise by the Commission with the written consent of the coastal State concerned .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
The activities concerned included training for judicial , administrative and military authorities , provision of material and logistical support to judicial authorities , as well as awareness campaigns , selection and training of government officials within ministries to act as human rights focal points , capacity-building for non _ governmental organizations , and training initiatives with a focus on social and economic rights .  
Takes note of statements made by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran about the need to review laws and attitudes which discriminate against women , and , remaining concerned at the lack of full and equal enjoyment by women of their human rights , as reported by the Special Representative , calls upon the Government to take substantive and effective measures to eliminate discrimination in law and in practice against women ;  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
Moreover , juridical bodies for the protection of human rights , unlike those concerned with diplomatic protection , were well established in both the internal legal order and the international system ; that was a matter that the Commission should consider .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
Deeply concerned , however , about the wide gap that continues to exist between the promise of human rights and their promotion and protection worldwide , and deeply concerned also about denials and violations of human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social including the right to development ,  
Expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress in investigating the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled areas , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate an immediate and objective international investigation of these incidents ;

Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Committee is still concerned , however , that the current data _ collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
The Committee remains concerned , however , at the large and increasing number of single _ parent families as well as the high number of abandoned children , especially children born out of wedlock , children of poor families , and children whose parents have left the country in search of economic opportunities .  
The Committee is particularly concerned with the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,

It acknowledged the inherent complementarity between the refugee-specific mandate of UNHCR and the broader human rights mandates of other concerned agencies and institutions , and asserted the need to maintain the mutually supportive but separate character of their respective mandates .  
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .

As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
On the other hand , several speakers agreed with the Secretary-Generals conclusion that a direct international radio broadcasting project would not be feasible until Member States and / or broadcast organizations concerned could provide the United Nations with the necessary budgetary and technical assistance .  
ACC agreed to encourage and reinforce cooperative arrangements which utilize flexible , pragmatic and differentiated approaches that are needs-driven , time-bound and bring together groups of concerned agencies around specific activities or programmes , designed to bring their respective comparative advantages into play to enhance effectiveness .

While the former provide mainly statistical information and important economic and social indicators , the information gathered from the relevant academic literature , from non-governmental organizations and from the press tends , by its very nature , to be more critical of the political , economic and social conditions in the countries concerned .  
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
The Committee is concerned about the disparities of living standards , especially with regard to education , health , life expectancy , child mortality , access to piped water and electricity and employment , to be found between the prosperous north _ east coast of Tunisia and the underdeveloped north _ west , between the interior of the country and the south , and between the towns and rural areas .  
The concept of social protection must be incorporated into a comprehensive employment policy framework , which should be concerned not only about creating jobs in normal periods of steady economic growth , but also and very much about dealing with the consequences of rapid job loss during economic crises and periods of restructuring .  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .

The Commission invited all organizations concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider whether their programmes of work provided sufficient consideration of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review what needed to be done to ensure adequate prediction and understanding of the impacts on coastal and marine areas of phenomena such as El Nio .  
Several Ministers stated that , while developing countries were generally encouraged by recent broad proposals on functioning of international financial markets and financing for development , they were concerned about the design of the initiatives to give effect to such proposals .  
On a reciprocal basis , States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings whereby , in relation to matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings in one or more States , the judicial authorities concerned may , where necessary together with police authorities and after informing the central authority or authorities referred to in paragraph 8 of this article , act jointly within joint investigation bodies .  
Invited all intergovernmental agencies concerned with aspects of the oceans to consider , within their respective mandates , whether their programmes of work make sufficient allowance for considerations of the potential impact of increased climate variability , and to review through the various coordination arrangements what more needs to be done to ensure adequate understanding of the prediction of coastal and marine impacts of such phenomena as El Nio .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms . 
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
It was stressed , however , that prior to undertaking peacekeeping missions , every effort should be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .

When one studies traditional practices , in particular female genital mutilation , it must first be noted that they are rooted in a whole set of beliefs , values , cultural and social behaviour patterns governing the lives of the societies concerned .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
Most importantly , as constituent components of human rights , these rights have to be achieved following the human rights approach , with full respect for civil and political rights and , with the effective participation of all concerned , equal opportunity of access and fair distribution of the benefits of development .  
While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
The Committee is concerned that the current data collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among the youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited psycho _ social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
While welcoming the State party 's efforts to adopt measures , both legal and educational , to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices affecting the health of children , the Committee remains concerned at the difficulties encountered in eliminating such practices .  
The Committee remains concerned about the conditions faced by children deprived of liberty , particularly children detained with adults without adequate protection from inhumane treatment , and about the insufficiency of programmes for the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of juveniles .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .  
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
She encouraged a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding between the worlds indigenous peoples and the Governments concerned and expressed the hoped that substantive and practical proposals would be made at the seventeenth session of the Working Group .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York .

In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .

The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;

While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
