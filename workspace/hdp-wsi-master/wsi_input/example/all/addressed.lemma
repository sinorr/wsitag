In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
In accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 49 / 194 and of the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 6 of its resolution 1995 / 54 , the High Commissioner , by a letter of 28 August 1995 addressed to all relevant United Nations agencies and financial institutions , has sought to explore possibilities for obtaining from such institutions , acting within their mandates , technical and financial assistance for supporting the Organization 's efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law .  
The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms .

His delegation believed that disarmament should be treated as a separate and distinct programme ; that decolonization continued to be an issue of vital importance for the United Nations ; and that all aspects of human rights should be addressed in a balanced manner . 
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered . 
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .

Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;

The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .

Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The Civil Affairs Unit has focused on the wide range of issues related to civilian reintegration , including the technical and substantive matters addressed in the 24 joint implementation committees and subcommittees which brought together Serb and Croat experts to resolve mutual problems .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule on implementation of the Abuja Agreement ( S / 1995 / 742 , annex ) .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
There is an imperative need to continue to build on the agreements already reached and for concerted efforts focused on unresolved issues which should be addressed at the forthcoming fourth special session on disarmament , as they represent a continuing threat to international peace and security .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,

In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
The information covers administrative arrangements set in place by Governments , such as designation of focal points and establishment of committees and commissions , as well as substantive measures such as elaboration of policies , formulation of programmes and organization of seminars , such as the Copenhagen seminars for social progress organized by Denmark , host Government of the Summit , to enrich the discourse and formulate common concepts and strategies on issues addressed by the Summit .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .

As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
The Council may also wish to decide that in developing future multi-year work programmes of individual functional commissions , these programmes should be coordinated with those of other functional commissions in such a manner that the themes and issues that will be considered or have been already decided for consideration by these commissions can be addressed from different perspectives in the same calendar year .  
Much has yet to be done in order to ensure that ongoing and future international assistance in support of the Government of Haiti for achieving sustainable development continues to be adequate and coherent , and that the main problems related to the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance are addressed .  
The challenges are multifaceted and involve a range of economic , social , educational , judicial and disarmament issues all of which must be addressed in an integrated , coordinated way .  
While there is increasing recognition in most developing countries of the need to use such high technology input in support of sustainable development and of developmental activities , interestingly there are two interrelated issues to be addressed : firstly , promoting the technology itself and the associated problems encountered and , secondly , effective utilization of the high technology knowledge , once acquired , for sustainable development activities .  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
States in the region demonstrated their growing recognition that refugee problems need to be addressed through the creation of effective legislative and institutional frameworks that are consistent with international standards .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
The continued and enhanced role of countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific is critical to the future development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories whose economic , political and social advancement can not be successfully addressed separately from the respective regions of which they are an integral part .

Furthermore , the Committee agreed on a detailed set of recommendations addressed to national parliaments on strengthening parliamentary input into the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session .  
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .

The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .

Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
It was proposed that two types of recommendations could normally be addressed to States parties by the Subcommittee : ( a ) those for more or less speedy implementation by the States parties themselves ; and ( b ) those which were supposed to be progressively implemented by the States parties through technical assistance and cooperation financed by the special fund to be set up pursuant to article 17 .  
An expert group meeting , convened from 31 March to 2 April 1998 , in cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , reviewed a comprehensive overview of the range of problems and issues which need to be addressed to improve statistics on paid and unpaid work , and defined activities which the project could carry out at the international , regional and national levels .

Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Calls on States , UNHCR and other concerned actors , taking into account that elderly refugees are particularly affected by social disintegration , chronic dependency and other adverse aspects of the refugee condition , to make renewed efforts to ensure that the rights , needs and dignity of elderly refugees are fully respected and addressed through appropriate programme activities ;

Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
The incipient organizational and structural transformation of the IPU into a genuine union of parliaments of the entire world , and the adaptation of its agenda to the whole range of issues addressed by the United Nations , will help to enhance the role of the United Nations itself , endowing it with a new parliamentary dimension .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
All the Movement ' s conferences have addressed it with the utmost gravity , because the Movement is fully aware that , despite international developments and the vast increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations , those States do not enjoy genuine representation commensurate with their number , international influence and desire to express their legitimate interests .  
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .

Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
They addressed a wide range of technical issues , including the use of saline water in agriculture , improved techniques for the development of water resources , the breeding and development of wheat and barley varieties which can be disease-resistant and tolerant of drought conditions , improvements in small ruminant production and the conservation of biodiversity and the environment in the Arab region . 
The Commission recognized that the issues in the areas of international trade in goods and services , as identified in paragraph 91 ( i , ii , iv and v ) of the Midrand final document , A Partnership for Growth and Development ( TD B 378 Rev . 1 ) , had been addressed in its four sessions and the relevant expert meetings .

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
In selecting the priority themes to be addressed at the high-level event , it was important to choose areas where greater understanding of the complex issues of development financing might be achieved ; where solid results might be attained ; where the impact of the measures taken could be maximized ; and where special emphasis could be given to the specific problems faced by the least developed countries .  
The key issues that need to be addressed if longterm capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
Those causes should be addressed in a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social and developmental instruments .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .

His delegation earnestly hoped that the question would be addressed during the current debate in a spirit of mutual accommodation and understanding , with the sole objective of ensuring a secure financial foundation for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
When he addressed the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , the Minister of Justice stated that the President of Equatorial Guinea was prepared to take the initiative to appoint a high-level team from his Government to meet with the Office of the High Commissioner in order to negotiate point by point a comprehensive programme of technical assistance , pursuant to Commission resolution 1999 / 19 of the year before .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
Indeed , there was a strong view put forward during the informal discussions on 26 and 27 February that at this stage , it would only be appropriate to request that the Independent Expert conduct a preliminary study into how such issues are already being addressed at the international level in the development context , to assist the Working Group in its future deliberations as to whether additional work was in fact required .  
Following his visit to Cuba , he had addressed communications to the countries whose territories had been utilized by the individuals and organizations that , in violation of international law and their own national legislation , had planned and directed , according to the available evidence , a number of criminal acts which must not remain unpunished .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
The review had primarily addressed whether the reform had fulfilled the three strategic goals of making the normative , analytical and operational functions clearer and more consistent with each other ; providing more effective policy support to intergovernmental bodies ; and improving the coordination of United Nations activities in the socio-economic area through integrated policy advice .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .

Convinced that the drug problem needs to be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive , balanced and integrated manner , involving both supply and demand reduction , in accordance with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together ,  
The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
The subjects addressed included study of the background to the approach of the United Nations to the phenomenon of mercenaries ; the state of international legislation on that subject , with special emphasis on article 47 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , regional legislation , particularly the Organization of African Unity Convention ; national legislation and evaluation of the means used to implement existing legislation .  
He said that the Meeting had been held against the background of the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture with two major objectives : ( i ) to clearly delineate those challenges and concerns that LDCs and NFIDCs faced during the Uruguay Round reform process in agriculture , and ( ii ) to examine how those concerns could be best addressed in the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations on agriculture .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .

With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
It was further stressed that a number of legal questions raised by electronic commerce could be addressed through contractual arrangements as preliminary measures pending adjustments to the legal framework .  
Against that background , the Working Group held an extensive exchange of views on whether it would be desirable to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
Stresses the importance of capacity building , as well as of developing and disseminating innovative technologies in respect of key sectors of development , particularly energy , and of investment in this regard , including through private sector involvement , market-oriented approaches , as well as supportive public policies and international cooperation , emphasizes that climate change and its adverse impacts have to be addressed through cooperation at all levels , and welcomes the efforts of all parties to implement the Convention ;

In order to ensure stringent and impartial law enforcement and prevent power abuse , the public security organs at various levels have also persistently and unremittingly addressed in a focused way such problems as misuse of coercive measures , extended custody , extortion of confession by torture , arbitrary imposition of fines , and arbitrary collection of fees .  As a result , the law-enforcement work of the public security community has become more regularized and the quality of law enforcement has improved rather significantly .  
In recent years , the Central Committee has addressed the problems of overproduction and constant lowering of prices in China .

Myers repeatedly emphasized the importance of satellite and space weapons systems in modern warfare when he addressed his almamater , Kansas State University , last year .  He did his best to play up the so-called " ballistic missile threat , " claiming that " weapons of mass destruction and vehicles that launch them to American cities are proliferating . "  
However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .

Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered . 
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
The practical difficulties in proving racial motivation beyond reasonable doubt , the adequacy of existing arrangements whereby the activities of extremist or racist organizations had been dealt with under existing criminal laws , and the general power of the courts to take racial motivation into account as an aggravating feature within existing maximum penalties were also addressed .  
Letter dated 20 November 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General , transmitting a joint communiqu entitled " The current international trading system and prospects for the promotion of trade among developing countries " , released at the sixth meeting of the Summit Level Group of Developing Countries , held at Harare from 3 to 5 November 1996 ( A / C . 2 / 51 / 10 ) .  
It had emphasized that the special needs and concerns of participating organizations should be addressed within the framework of the common system , and had stressed the importance of maintaining a coherent and unified system . 
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .

Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The Civil Affairs Unit has focused on the wide range of issues related to civilian reintegration , including the technical and substantive matters addressed in the 24 joint implementation committees and subcommittees which brought together Serb and Croat experts to resolve mutual problems .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule on implementation of the Abuja Agreement ( S / 1995 / 742 , annex ) .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
There is an imperative need to continue to build on the agreements already reached and for concerted efforts focused on unresolved issues which should be addressed at the forthcoming fourth special session on disarmament , as they represent a continuing threat to international peace and security .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient atttention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
Considering that the question of restitution , compensation and rehabilitation of victims of grave violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms has received insufficient attention and should continue to be addressed in a more systematic and thorough way at the national and international levels ,  
The audit reports identified a large number of administrative deficiencies , which addressed the broad issues of control at the Centre and highlighted the unjustified use of reimbursable loan agreements , the inadequate control over the selection of hiring of outside expertise leading to higher fees and selection of insufficiently qualified candidates .

There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .

These causes should be addressed in a coherent , well-planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social , economic and developmental instruments .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
The information covers administrative arrangements set in place by Governments , such as designation of focal points and establishment of committees and commissions , as well as substantive measures such as elaboration of policies , formulation of programmes and organization of seminars , such as the Copenhagen seminars for social progress organized by Denmark , host Government of the Summit , to enrich the discourse and formulate common concepts and strategies on issues addressed by the Summit .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Group of 77 and China also fully supported the World Food Summit , at which the most serious problems were to be considered and addressed and the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the commitments assumed under Agenda 21 , which would provide the international community with an excellent opportunity to study the principal obstacles to the effective implementation of the Rio agreements . 
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
Specifically , operational activities at national , subregional and regional levels addressed : preventive education for high risk groups ( school children , street children ) ; prevention for intravenous drug abusers to contain the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; implementation of common standards for epidemiological monitoring and systems of information on drug abuse ; prevention of drug abuse in the workplace ; and training for rehabilitation and integration of former drug addicts into society , involving health and education authorities .  
The needs of the floating populations such as the homeless , squatters , the rural indigent , urban slum dwellers and physically disabled people must be addressed through fundamental social welfare and rehabilitation programmes .

As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .

Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
While this concern must be addressed , it is important to keep in mind that this concern is being raised at a stage when the creation of special procedures to look at various aspects of civil and political rights is almost complete and a similar exercise has just begun in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
States in the region demonstrated their growing recognition that refugee problems need to be addressed through the creation of effective legislative and institutional frameworks that are consistent with international standards .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
The continued and enhanced role of countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific is critical to the future development of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories whose economic , political and social advancement can not be successfully addressed separately from the respective regions of which they are an integral part .  
The report of the Secretary-General on key actions for the further implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , 11 submitted to the Commission on Population and Development acting as the preparatory committee for the special session had addressed the specific problems and challenges posed by international migration .  
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .  
Female infanticide was addressed in the Commissions resolution 1999 / 80 , on the rights of the child , with States being called upon to eliminate the root causes of son preference which resulted in harmful and unethical practices , and to eradicate traditional or customary practices , particularly female genital mutilation , that were harmful to women and girls and that violated their human rights .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
Furthermore , the Committee agreed on a detailed set of recommendations addressed to national parliaments on strengthening parliamentary input into the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session .  
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
Two aspects of Internet accessibility were addressed by the Gateway initiative : ( a ) user-friendly Web design based on universal principles to facilitate access by users with physical or sensorial disabilities and ( b ) text-based and low-intensity graphical content to facilitate access by users with low levels of information technology or communications capacities ( bandwidth ) .  
Conscious that the ageing of the worlds population represents an unparalleled and urgent policy and programme challenge to Governments , non-governmental organizations and private groups in ensuring that the needs of the aged and their human resource potential are adequately addressed ,  
The key issues which need to be addressed if long-term capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
It concluded that , after nearly three decades of substantial change in global economic and social conditions in the cooperative movement and in the relations between it and Governments , there was need to change the tone and emphasis of the Recommendation to reassess the underlying concepts of aid to cooperatives and to include matters not addressed by it .  
Taking into account that elderly refugees are particularly affected by social disintegration , chronic dependency and other adverse aspects of the refugee condition , calls on States , UNHCR and other concerned actors to make renewed efforts to ensure that the rights , needs and dignity of elderly refugee are fully respected and addressed through appropriate programme activities ;  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Given the special difficulties faced by African countries in their effective participation in the multilateral trading system , the workshop held at Pretoria also addressed their specific concerns , taking into account the outcome of the Coordinating Workshop for Senior Advisers to Ministers of Trade of least developed countries in preparation for the WTO Ministerial Conference , held at Sun City , South Africa ( 21-25 June 1999 ) .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
He hoped that national and international efforts would be redoubled to ensure that the deliberations at the 2002 quinquennial review and appraisal of the World Programme of Action adequately reflected the issues that must be addressed in the areas of social integration , technology , information and comprehensive protection to guarantee equitable development for the disabled in the new millennium .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
In addition , it was pointed out that draft article 27 could be deleted , since it addressed the contractual aspects of assignment , namely a matter which was not the main focus of the draft Convention and might already be sufficiently regulated by private international law ( even though the principle of freedom of choice of the applicable law might not be common to all legal systems ) .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .  
It was noted that favourable conditions for return could only be achieved if the fundamental causes of displacement were addressed and the State fully implemented the multiple recommendations made by the international community in regard to the protection of human rights and humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
It was proposed that two types of recommendations could normally be addressed to States parties by the Subcommittee : ( a ) those for more or less speedy implementation by the States parties themselves ; and ( b ) those which were supposed to be progressively implemented by the States parties through technical assistance and cooperation financed by the special fund to be set up pursuant to article 17 .  
An expert group meeting , convened from 31 March to 2 April 1998 , in cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , reviewed a comprehensive overview of the range of problems and issues which need to be addressed to improve statistics on paid and unpaid work , and defined activities which the project could carry out at the international , regional and national levels .  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
Those were the key elements of an informed approach to global population and development priorities for the twenty-first century and should be addressed in the context of an enabling economic , social and cultural environment at the national and international levels .  
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Calls on States , UNHCR and other concerned actors , taking into account that elderly refugees are particularly affected by social disintegration , chronic dependency and other adverse aspects of the refugee condition , to make renewed efforts to ensure that the rights , needs and dignity of elderly refugees are fully respected and addressed through appropriate programme activities ;  
The main issues they addressed include adult education , legal and social security , integrated systems of welfare and health actions and services , with a focus on Alzheimer ' s patients some half a-million persons in Italy are afflicted in old age by this illness active ageing , empowerment , ageing and gender , and social security .  
Many specific aspects of such a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention are addressed in the General Assembly : social cohesion , the eradication of poverty , the protection of minorities and human rights , democratic governance , peacekeeping and the rule of law in internal and international relations .  
The incipient organizational and structural transformation of the IPU into a genuine union of parliaments of the entire world , and the adaptation of its agenda to the whole range of issues addressed by the United Nations , will help to enhance the role of the United Nations itself , endowing it with a new parliamentary dimension .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
At our second Conference , held in Managua in 1994 , we took another important step when we adopted the Managua Declaration and Plan of Action , which addressed issues relating to the political and reconciliation processes within national societies , human rights and the right of all nations to development , economic reforms , structural adjustment programmes and other problems facing democratic States .  
All the Movement ' s conferences have addressed it with the utmost gravity , because the Movement is fully aware that , despite international developments and the vast increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations , those States do not enjoy genuine representation commensurate with their number , international influence and desire to express their legitimate interests .  
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
The Commission had expressed its appreciation for the work accomplished by the Working Group in its preparation of draft uniform rules on electronic signatures , and at the same time had noted that the Working Group had experienced difficulties in reaching a common understanding of the new legal issues arising from the increased use of digital and other electronic signatures , and on how those issues might be addressed in an internationally acceptable legal framework .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
This task is fulfilled through in-depth analyses , pioneering research and debates , conducted with a multidisciplinary methodology , on the process of social and economic change in contemporary societies and of the demands addressed to political , legal , judicial and social professions .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
With regard to the laws against discrimination , the Minister stated that it was critical that refugees be specifically regulated under domestic law rather than treated as ordinary aliens , and that , whilst general discrimination was largely addressed , particular forms of discrimination should be rendered unlawful i.e.racist and xenophobic offences as well as discrimination in employment and the supply of goods and services ;  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
They addressed a wide range of technical issues , including the use of saline water in agriculture , improved techniques for the development of water resources , the breeding and development of wheat and barley varieties which can be disease-resistant and tolerant of drought conditions , improvements in small ruminant production and the conservation of biodiversity and the environment in the Arab region . 
The Commission recognized that the issues in the areas of international trade in goods and services , as identified in paragraph 91 ( i , ii , iv and v ) of the Midrand final document , A Partnership for Growth and Development ( TD B 378 Rev . 1 ) , had been addressed in its four sessions and the relevant expert meetings .  
The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
In selecting the priority themes to be addressed at the high-level event , it was important to choose areas where greater understanding of the complex issues of development financing might be achieved ; where solid results might be attained ; where the impact of the measures taken could be maximized ; and where special emphasis could be given to the specific problems faced by the least developed countries .  
The key issues that need to be addressed if longterm capital is to be made available are the provision of acceptable collateral or its alternative in terms of guarantee schemes and the lowering of administrative / transaction costs .  
Those causes should be addressed in a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social and developmental instruments .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
Many countries have addressed the lack of both and have called for collaborative efforts to give serious attention to the need for social , economic and scientific research in light of the enormous challenges ahead . 
His delegation earnestly hoped that the question would be addressed during the current debate in a spirit of mutual accommodation and understanding , with the sole objective of ensuring a secure financial foundation for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
When he addressed the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , the Minister of Justice stated that the President of Equatorial Guinea was prepared to take the initiative to appoint a high-level team from his Government to meet with the Office of the High Commissioner in order to negotiate point by point a comprehensive programme of technical assistance , pursuant to Commission resolution 1999 / 19 of the year before .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
Indeed , there was a strong view put forward during the informal discussions on 26 and 27 February that at this stage , it would only be appropriate to request that the Independent Expert conduct a preliminary study into how such issues are already being addressed at the international level in the development context , to assist the Working Group in its future deliberations as to whether additional work was in fact required .  
Following his visit to Cuba , he had addressed communications to the countries whose territories had been utilized by the individuals and organizations that , in violation of international law and their own national legislation , had planned and directed , according to the available evidence , a number of criminal acts which must not remain unpunished .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
The review had primarily addressed whether the reform had fulfilled the three strategic goals of making the normative , analytical and operational functions clearer and more consistent with each other ; providing more effective policy support to intergovernmental bodies ; and improving the coordination of United Nations activities in the socio-economic area through integrated policy advice .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
Convinced that the drug problem needs to be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive , balanced and integrated manner , involving both supply and demand reduction , in accordance with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together ,  
Convinced that the drug problem needs to be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive , balanced and integrated manner , involving both supply and demand reduction , in accordance with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together ,  
The Subcommittee also agreed that there remained a number of issues and concerns to be addressed , in particular with regard to the relationship between that initiative and existing international space law and that , in view of its primary responsibility for the development of international space law , the Subcommittee should make every effort to deal effectively with that new subject of substantial legal significance . 
Indonesia concurred with the observation made by the expert seminar that questions of racism and racial discrimination were complex and demanded comprehensive solutions that not only included legal provisions but also addressed social , economic and cultural issues .  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
Some speakers noted that those and other issues related to the return of funds of illicit origin were the subject of constitutional and other provisions of their domestic legislation and that those issues would need to be addressed by the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to prepare draft terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption and the ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
The Sub-Commission has already addressed impunity involving civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , in two excellent studies .  [ 175 ] While neither study directly addresses terrorist acts , terrorist acts viewed as impairing civil and political rights have been those drawing the most attention in the Commission and the Sub-Commission and on the part of the Special Rapporteur in her previous work and in the present report as well .  
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
The subjects addressed included study of the background to the approach of the United Nations to the phenomenon of mercenaries ; the state of international legislation on that subject , with special emphasis on article 47 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , regional legislation , particularly the Organization of African Unity Convention ; national legislation and evaluation of the means used to implement existing legislation .  
He said that the Meeting had been held against the background of the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture with two major objectives : ( i ) to clearly delineate those challenges and concerns that LDCs and NFIDCs faced during the Uruguay Round reform process in agriculture , and ( ii ) to examine how those concerns could be best addressed in the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations on agriculture .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Specifically , in resolution 1355 ( 2001 ) of 15 June 2001 , the Council called on all relevant parties to ensure that urgent child protection concerns were addressed in all national , bilateral and regional dialogues and that child soldiers were expeditiously demobilized , and urged Member States to ensure adequate and sustained resources for long-term reintegration .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
It was further stressed that a number of legal questions raised by electronic commerce could be addressed through contractual arrangements as preliminary measures pending adjustments to the legal framework .  
Against that background , the Working Group held an extensive exchange of views on whether it would be desirable to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
Having considered the various views that were expressed , the Working Group agreed that it would be useful to formulate a model legislative provision that listed essential issues that needed to be addressed in the project agreement .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
Stresses the importance of capacity building , as well as of developing and disseminating innovative technologies in respect of key sectors of development , particularly energy , and of investment in this regard , including through private sector involvement , market-oriented approaches , as well as supportive public policies and international cooperation , emphasizes that climate change and its adverse impacts have to be addressed through cooperation at all levels , and welcomes the efforts of all parties to implement the Convention ;
