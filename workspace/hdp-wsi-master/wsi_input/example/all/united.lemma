China is glad to see Tunisia 's achievements made over the past few years in safeguarding social stability and promoting economic development .  China hopes to develop the future-oriented , sincere , friendly , united , and cooperative relations with Tunisia .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
It firmly grasped the two major themes of unity and democracy , earnestly performed its functions , conscientiously discuss major affairs of the state , actively make proposals , promptly and truthfully reflect the conditions of society and public opinion , made constant efforts to solidify and develop the patriotic united front , further expand friendly contacts , and made important contributions to the all-round economic and social development .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
This has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .  
In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
In 1999 , news propaganda units publicized odes to the motherland , socialism , and China 's reform and opening up , stimulated the people 's patriotic enthusiasms , rallied the people 's national spirit , safeguarded social stability , and created public opinion which has been optimistic , progressive , united , and forging ahead .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central and provincial authorities , we have conscientiously organized the " three-stress " education and , combining it with the activities of setting up " united , clean , and good leading groups with a pioneering spirit " launched in the entire city , lost no time in resolving the problems unsuited to the new situation and new tasks facing the party building and the SEZ development .  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
The more distinct and stronger the main theme is , the more unified our thinking will be , the more closely our forces will be rallied , the more united our people will become , the more stable our society will be , the more smoothly our reforms will advance , and the greater guarantee we will provide for the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy .  
at the same time , an individual 's responsibilities and duties for the collective and the state are stressed ; all people are encouraged to care about the overall interests of the nation , be honest and keep their promises , be united and help each other , be enthusiastic for public benefits , and do more good things for the people and for society .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
- - - Equipment training system for combat readiness : In the training system , this department adopted a training system which organically combines education in institutions with training in the base and troop training , persisted in conducting complete and united individual training , unit training , training for chiefs and organs , and comprehensive drills , basically built an orderly , regular , and well-coordinated equipment training system for combat readiness , which has a perfect structure and content .  
We must closely unite around the Central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the mighty banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , further raising awareness , following up each victory with fervent pursuit , and resolutely removing and discarding the " social tumor " of " Falungong " , in order to consolidate and develop the stable and united political situation of our nation as well as to ensure the successful progress of liberalized reforms and the undertakings of modernized construction .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the meeting of the national united front work that , only by persisting in developing the most extensive patriotic united front led by our Party and uniting the entire Chinese people to make joint striving to materialize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people , can we be certain of success .  
Compared with the Yuanhua case , the Chaoshan tax fraud case involves not only huge sums but also evil methods ; the corrupt officials " united as one to cheat the old CPC " and " worked with concerted efforts to plunder the state treasury , " and in addition the methods they used were that of " white wolves with empty gloves " and they directly plundered more than RMB 100-billion from the state treasury by fraudulent means .  
Nowadays , in Tibet , the new Tibetan leading clique represent the biggest vested interests , which are sharing interests with the Chinese communists in reality and acting as the most formidable opponent to Dalai . Especially , the Chinese communists have concentrated their united front work on lamaseries .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
They " removed the red star but kept their red heart , and changed their cap insignia but did not change their tradition " .  Their heart is forever facing the CPC . In the course of fulfilling their task of national liberation , our army never forgot their mission of democratic revolution , were sober-minded , smashed the KMT created incidents of " friction " within the united front , maintained high morale at the end of the national war , waged resolute struggle against the KMT reactionaries , and won final victory in the liberation war .  
" The CPC was born on this ancient land in 1921 .  At that point the banner of the struggle for the total liberation of Chinese women began flying across China . Under party leadership , women , long condemned to the bottom rung of society , were mobilized and organized to form a broad-based united front that was dominated by workers , peasants , and working women and that brought together women of all nationalities and from all walks of life .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the development course of our party over the past 80 years , the three generations of the leading bodies of the party separately with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin at the core established and developed the most extensive united front to win over the people 's support and rally strength to the maximum .  The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
In the new period of reform , opening up , and modernization , the party established and developed the patriotic united front , extensively united Chinese people at home and abroad , in the course of consistently carrying out the basic line of " one center , two basic points " , to make joint efforts for deepening reforms , expanding opening-up , speeding up development , safeguarding stability , promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao , and promoting the development of cross-strait relations .  Great achievements attracting worldwide attention were achieved in this regard .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
the disparities related to major political principles must be criticized and corrected in an unambiguous way , and political guidance should be given to achieve new unity on the new basis .  Thus , the united front may always maintain a relaxed , stable , united , and harmonious political environment inside .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
and they are troops that are fully trusted by the party and the people .  The vast number of cadres , and leading cadres in particular , must penetrate the grass-roots levels and the masses , and must serve the people wholeheartedly .  They must continue to embody " the old Tibetan spirit " of " being extremely arduous , full of fighting valor , patient , united , and contributory " so as to make new contributions for the prosperity and development of Tibet .

Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;

With the party Central Committee 's firm leadership , and with the selfless support of all fraternal nationalities of the big family in the motherland , a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet will advance with giant strides on its journey in the new century .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .

After gaining an understanding of the Chinese communists ' deeds and plan for united front work , the case was raised to the level of national security and psychological strategies .  National security units and the staff officers ' headquarters have held a series of meetings to study ways and means of tackling the problem , and President Chen will be hearing reports on the case .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .

Wang Zhaoguo emphatically pointed out : Facing the very complicated current international situation and formidable domestic construction tasks , comrades of the united front must have a clear understanding of the situation , firm up their confidence , keep their heads cool , and adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
Raidi pointed out : In Tibet , there is now smooth administration , all kinds of businesses are thriving , the society is stable , people of various nationalities are united , border defense has been consolidated , and people are living in peace and happiness .  Tibet is now in the best period of development since peaceful liberation in terms of social stability and economic development .  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
We should create a warm , joyful , united , inspiring atmosphere around the main theme , and should organize various activities with the spirit of innovation by improving the work style , stressing real results , preventing waste and extravagance , and opposing formalism . 
They " removed the red star but kept their red heart , and changed their cap insignia but did not change their tradition " .  Their heart is forever facing the CPC . In the course of fulfilling their task of national liberation , our army never forgot their mission of democratic revolution , were sober-minded , smashed the KMT created incidents of " friction " within the united front , maintained high morale at the end of the national war , waged resolute struggle against the KMT reactionaries , and won final victory in the liberation war .  
" The CPC was born on this ancient land in 1921 .  At that point the banner of the struggle for the total liberation of Chinese women began flying across China . Under party leadership , women , long condemned to the bottom rung of society , were mobilized and organized to form a broad-based united front that was dominated by workers , peasants , and working women and that brought together women of all nationalities and from all walks of life .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the development course of our party over the past 80 years , the three generations of the leading bodies of the party separately with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin at the core established and developed the most extensive united front to win over the people 's support and rally strength to the maximum .  The united front made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reforms and scored brilliant achievements .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
In the new period of reform , opening up , and modernization , the party established and developed the patriotic united front , extensively united Chinese people at home and abroad , in the course of consistently carrying out the basic line of " one center , two basic points " , to make joint efforts for deepening reforms , expanding opening-up , speeding up development , safeguarding stability , promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao , and promoting the development of cross-strait relations .  Great achievements attracting worldwide attention were achieved in this regard .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
the disparities related to major political principles must be criticized and corrected in an unambiguous way , and political guidance should be given to achieve new unity on the new basis .  Thus , the united front may always maintain a relaxed , stable , united , and harmonious political environment inside .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , under the guidance of the party three-generation leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core and , through the unremitting hard work of all party members and the people of all nationalities across the country , who have united as one in their struggle , tremendous changes of historic significance have taken place in the economic , political , cultural , and social features of China .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
As the vanguard of the Chinese working class , the CPC always represents the requirements for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest possible masses of the people in China . Such a class status and such a historic mission have determined that the united front can be led only by the CPC .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
and they are troops that are fully trusted by the party and the people .  The vast number of cadres , and leading cadres in particular , must penetrate the grass-roots levels and the masses , and must serve the people wholeheartedly .  They must continue to embody " the old Tibetan spirit " of " being extremely arduous , full of fighting valor , patient , united , and contributory " so as to make new contributions for the prosperity and development of Tibet .

It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
With the party Central Committee 's firm leadership , and with the selfless support of all fraternal nationalities of the big family in the motherland , a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet will advance with giant strides on its journey in the new century .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
We definitely will follow the guidance of the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech at the grand gathering marking the CPC 's 80th founding anniversary and the spirit of the fourth forum held by the Central Authorities on the work in Tibet , fully mobilize and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativeness of all circles to constantly push forward the great cause of building a socialist new Tibet that is united , prosperous and civilized .  
Under the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , follow the guidance of the important thinking of the " three represents , " work with one heart and one mind , press forward continuously , and work hard to build a united , affluent , and civilized socialist new Tibet and achieve the great revitalization of the Chinese nation !  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
After gaining an understanding of the Chinese communists ' deeds and plan for united front work , the case was raised to the level of national security and psychological strategies .  National security units and the staff officers ' headquarters have held a series of meetings to study ways and means of tackling the problem , and President Chen will be hearing reports on the case .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .

Wang Zhaoguo pointed out that the united front has always paid attention to ideological and political work , especially since the Party 's 14th National Congress . With Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core of the Party 's Central Committee and with the ideological and political work of the united front as the key link in rallying and mobilizing people of all realms and all nationalities to bring about the responsibilities of the Party and country , it has effectively mobilized people of all realms to take part in modernization construction and enthusiasm for the glorious national rejuvenation .

It is a complicated and long-term task to correctly appraise the social situation and the will of the people .

and have also played an important role in promoting a democratic and scientific policymaking process .  Facts prove that to conduct investigation and study on selected major questions of economic and social development in a planned way is a good form for the democratic parties , the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs and exercise democratic supervision ; and it is also a good way to do the united front work under the historical conditions .  
The voice of the greater number of developing nations has been a united voice , particularly focusing on suffering from unfair treatment and other issues , and stressing that we must through strong efforts establish a new international political and economic order that is equal , just , and rational .  The " joint declaration " passed by the conference embodies the spirit of seeking common ground and reserving differences , and achieved positive results .  
The Chinese Communist Party has united and led the various ethnic groups of China and carried out an indomitable and extremely hard and bitter struggle , always passing on the torch .  They overturned the " three mountains " that oppressed the Chinese people and created a new historical era in which the Chinese are their own masters in independently constructing socialism .  
Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this time , the Chinese Olympic delegation has made historical breakthroughs , displayed fully to the whole world the spiritual style and features of being united and forging ahead of the Chinese people , greatly encouraged the patriotic fervor of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , increased the national cohesive force of Chinese at home and abroad , and further enhanced the high prestige of the socialist motherland .  
Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog said with deep feeling that 50 years later , Qamdo is no longer the same as before .  A new Qamdo , where the economy is developing , society is advancing , the political situation is stable , the people of all nationalities are united , and the people live and work in peace and contentment , stands like a giant on Sanjiang Plain .  
Xia Yan was talented , knowledgeable , and had a respectable professional attitude and possessed a professional attitude that nice Chinese intellectuals have , which is love of what they do and a deep research into what they do .

The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .

We must hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , combine the advanced and extensive requirements , and strive to give play to the united front 's positive role in advancing cultural construction ; at the same time , we must strengthen ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural construction within the united front , and promote the firm establishment of common ideals and moral pillars in society as a whole and the improvement of the whole nation 's scientific and cultural qualities .  
United front cadres at various levels should improve their political , theoretical , and professional qualities in an all-round way and strive to become qualified united front cadres who have a firm stand , a democratic style of work , extensive knowledge , and an innovative spirit and who are well received by friends outside the party .  
given form to and maintained a heartening and lively situation marked by unity and stability ; and has made new contributions to deepening reform , boosting development , safeguarding stability , and promoting the reunification of the motherland .

It has provided a powerful force for promoting reform of the state-run enterprises and for extricating them from their difficulties .  
There is also need to constantly secure and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front , bring into play the initiative and creativity of all social circles , and gather the wisdom and forces of the entire Chinese people .  Only in this way , will we succeed in our cause and achieve bigger victories .  This is a basic theory .  
[ Wang ] Upon entering the new century , the party 's basic requirements on united front work are : Holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism ; uniting with all the forces that can be united ; mobilizing all positive factors ; turning negative factors into positive ones ; catering to the establishment of socialist economy , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics ; catering to the political situation of stability and unity ; catering to the realization of the motherland 's complete reunification ; catering to world peace ; and catering to common development .  
First , we will conscientiously study the important speeches by Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades as well as the relevant spirit of the current conference .  Through training courses , study courses , and other forms , we will further improve the understanding of all levels of party and government leading cadres on the importance of united front work , and secure and develop the situation in which the entire party and society pay attention to and support united front work .  
He said , the united front work conference convened by the CPC Central Committee was a meeting in which the CPC further enhanced and deepened understanding of the important status and role of the united front , unified the thinking of the whole party , and deployed and mobilized the whole party to attach importance to united front work ; it is of great significance in the history of the united front under CPC leadership in carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future .  
An editorial published by the party organ newspaper the same day particularly mentioned that " the united front includes an alliance of two scopes , that within and that outside the mainland , " " in particular the several score million overseas compatriots form a unique strong point in promoting China 's modernization and achieving the complete reunification of the motherland , and are also a unique strong point in developing friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world and promoting economic and cultural exchanges with countries the world over . "  
They expressed that in the new century they will fully exercise the role of the democratic parties in participating in political affairs , positively participate in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , strengthen democratic supervision , make efforts to offer advice and make suggestions , further intensify their self-construction , and work hard to build the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce into high-quality parties participating in political affairs and an important mass organization of the united front suited to the requirements of the 21st century .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
Let us closely rally around the CPC central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , keep firm confidence , get united and work cooperatively with one heart and one mind , continue to maintain and improve the CPC-led multi-party cooperation and political consultation system , consolidate and strengthen the most extensive patriotic united front , and join hands in striving for the realization of the grand objectives and the fulfillment of the three major tasks in the new century .  
Practice has proved that the series of major decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core are correct ; all localities and departments have been effective in implementing the line , principles , and policies of the central authorities ; and the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel , educational workers , as well as people from all social circles on the united front have made remarkable contribution to the country 's economic development .  
Under the strong leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , take the important thinking on " three represents " as a guideline , keep firm confidence and soaring spirits , do down-to-earth work , get united to make progress , and strive to achieve our country 's grand objectives of reform , opening up , and modernization in the new century .  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
The 65 million people of different ethnic groups in the province are united as one as they exerted themselves and kept forging ahead .  In particular , they have gone through the rigorous tests of three consecutive years of exceptionally serious floods and scored remarkable achievements in economic and social development .  
He said : In order to maintain stability , it is imperative to have a harmonious social environment , as the common saying goes : " A knife held with a united strength is sharp enough to cut gold . " 
The CPPCC organizations at all levels should continue to carry out the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and the eight-point proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin , actively promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel visits , strive to unite all internal and external forces that can be united , resolutely oppose any attempt to split the motherland , and make contributions to accomplishing the great cause of reunifying the motherland .  
On the future development of Inner Mongolia , Deputy Uyunqimg said : The autonomous region has made fairly rapid economic development since the beginning of reform and opening up , especially during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period .  The 23 million people of various nationalities in Inner Mongolia , united as one , withstood the severe tests of extraordinarily serious droughts and floods and smoothly fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan through concerted efforts , thus promoting sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development and all-round social progress .  
Lastly , we all agreed that if Hong Kong was to enjoy a healthy development across the whole economic , political and social spectrum , we must make every effort to maintain stability and stay united .  We must also ensure Hong Kong and the Mainland develop a good interactive relationship within the " One Country , Two Systems " framework .  In short , all of us should work together towards this objective .  
President Carter 's shameful betrayal of a sworn U . S . ally and faithful friend has met with united opposition both inside and outside the Republic of China . The first public response to this abrupt change in American policy was seen in front of the National Taiwan University ( NTU ) , a center for the airing of public reaction to important issues .  
This great tradition is seen in the annual increase in the number of overseas Chinese visitors , their augmented investment in productive enterprises here , their insistent and courageous resistance to Chinese Communist united front temptations , and especially in their active moral and physical support of the government in their motherland during the last two months . "  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government .
