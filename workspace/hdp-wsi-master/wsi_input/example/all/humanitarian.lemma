The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
In 1999 , the US-led NATO disregarded the norm of International Law and bypassed the UNSC and frenziedly bombed a sovereign state-the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for as long as 78 days , causing the biggest humanitarian disaster in Europe since the World War II , killed more than 2,000 innocent civilians , and wounded more than 6,000 people .  Some one-million people lost their homes and more than two-million people lost their sources of income .  The direct economic losses reached $ 600-billion yuan .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
In his May 20 speech , he indicated the intention to " continually strengthen substantive diplomatic relations with friendly countries , " and also declared , in an undisguised manner , that Taiwan " will vigorously participate in various international nongovernment organizations and take an active part in international affairs through such diverse means as humanitarian concerns , economic and trade cooperation , and cultural exchanges , so as to expand Taiwan 's space for survival internationally . "  
Wang noted that the UN should make more positive contributions to preventing massive humanitarian crises and the tragic mass killings of innocent civilians .  At the same time , it should be fully aware of the complexity of international intervention and the risk of inappropriate intervention .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
From a humanitarian standpoint , it is this earnest desire to lead a life in a free , democratic society that has earned the people 's sympathy . Finally after one year , three months and one week the six patriots finally realized the fulfillment of their long cherished dream - - their sentences were suspended and they were allowed to go to their homeland , the Republic of China .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The achievement of a well-coordinated and coherent response requires the cooperation of the principal bodies concerned , be they of a political , humanitarian or specialized economic and social nature .  
The rapid start-up of a coherent , effective mine-clearance programme therefore implies very close coordination of the various United Nations bodies responsible for humanitarian assistance and economic and social recovery .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
The most pressing financial questions before the United Nations involve paying the bills for ongoing operations and raising the funds to pay for its foreseeable obligations in peace-keeping , humanitarian relief and sustainable development .  
Mexico 's drug control policy is founded on the humanitarian principle of protection of the individual , with strict adherence to law and supported by the legal , organizational and functional soundness of national institutions .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
In that context , the Council requested the " Secretary-General to direct urgent preparation of a detailed plan with concrete steps setting out UNOSOM II 's future concerted strategy with regard to its humanitarian , political and security activities " .  
This active role of the Organization , in bilateral and multilateral negotiations alike , should extend to the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian spheres .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
The independent Commission of Experts concluded that even though the conflict in Rwanda was a domestic one its consequences affected the entire international community , inasmuch as fundamental principles of international humanitarian law were violated .  
Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
Nongovernmental organizations are established through the voluntary association and decision of private individuals or groups for a variety of purposes , which may be political , humanitarian , religious , professional or simply associative .  
Several major cities remained under siege , encircled or under sustained military pressure by one or the other side , resulting in increased hardship for the civilian population and compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation .  
Both sides demonstrated a sincere concern to resolve the complex set of political , military , humanitarian and socioeconomic problems arising from the political confrontation and civil war in the Republic of Tajikistan .  
Only sustained , cooperative work on the underlying economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems can place an achieved peace on a durable foundation .  
The flagrant disregard for basic human rights and international humanitarian law is continuing to expand the range of human suffering , often placing fragile political and social structures in neighbouring regions and countries under unbearable pressure .  
In contrast , in many African countries the humanitarian crises manifest a low point in a continuing process of structural deterioration compounded by internal conflict or externally induced destabilization .  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
These provoked a massive stampede of refugees across the border into Zaire in the northwest , overwhelming humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) whose preparations had anticipated the simultaneous movement of refugees further south .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
Mr . MARTENS ( Federal Republic of Germany ) said that the need for detailed rules of humanitarian law , unnecessary in an ideal world , had been clearly demonstrated by the recent escalation of internal and international armed conflicts .  
A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;  
Since international public support was a necessary prerequisite for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions , the number of which was increasing , an effective information and communication component was essential to their success .  
The large number of regional conflicts in which international humanitarian law and human rights were seriously violated indicated that there was an urgent need to take practical steps to achieve a form of universal criminal jurisdiction .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
Its implementation required a broad partnership of national , regional and international actors to be coordinated by UNHCR , which must preserve its nonpolitical and humanitarian approach .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
The Commission shall create a database intended to be a complete and standardized record on alleged grave violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda including possible acts of genocide .  
There is no doubt that humanitarian law has been violated and that cultural monuments have been destroyed by all three parties in the tragic civil , ethnic and religious war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
It coordinated and monitored humanitarian assistance operations , provided technical assistance to and verified the entire electoral process , culminating in the holding of free and fair elections on 27 to 29 October 1994 .  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
In view of the increasing use of United Nations peace-keeping operations in support of humanitarian activities , the High Commissioner recognized the need for improved understanding , new doctrines and operational procedures , and new mutually advantageous systems for coordination between UNHCR and the military .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of the Second World War fell silent , one notes with satisfaction the valuable work performed by the United Nations as a forum for debate on matters of international concern , and as a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
Indeed , beyond the simple maintenance of international peace and security , the Organization remarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for decolonization , but , above all , in the establishment of a progressive system of specialized agencies , all of which provide highly valued assistance in the social , economic , humanitarian and cultural fields .  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
We call upon the international community to contribute fully to the definition and implementation of the new role of the United Nations , which undoubtedly is of a humanitarian nature , and aims at protecting and preserving life on our planet and at raising the standard of living of all peoples , through the establishment of a new , balanced and equitable international economic and social order .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
The IPU has played a very positive and active role in supporting United Nations efforts in various parts of the world , in various conflicts and in the fields of disarmament , international humanitarian law , economic and social development , the environment and the advancement of women , as well as its important role in enhancing democracy .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Elsewhere in the draft resolution 's operative part , the Secretary-General is requested to continue to deploy his efforts towards strengthening cooperation and coordination between the two organizations and their specialized agencies in order for the two organizations to enhance their capacity to serve their mutual interests in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields .  
The agenda of the latest meeting between the two organizations included a number of issues of paramount importance , including political questions , such as the maintenance of international peace and security ; humanitarian issues , such as mine clearance ; and such economic and social issues as desertification control , protection of the environment , sustainable development , narcotics control and crime prevention .  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
Sudan 's multidimensional cooperation with the international community as represented by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations in ensuring the flow of humanitarian assistance has been the subject of special appreciation by the United Nations as demonstrated in General Assembly resolutions and in the Secretary-General 's report which underscores the success of OLS in assisting all the needy .  
In considering the continuum with respect to systematic breakdowns or societal implosion , the matter becomes more complicated in the sense that the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in contributing to rebuilding a society decimated by conflict depends on how effectively the underlying political problems of such emergencies have been addressed .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
At the same time , it is clear that the magnitude of the Chernobyl disaster in terms of a humanitarian tragedy , especially in the present economic and social context , has given rise to new and additional problems of general concern which , if they are to be resolved , require the establishment of broad-based and active international cooperation and the coordination of efforts in this sphere at the national and international levels .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Recognizing , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies , the need to utilize fully the national potential of countries in providing the United Nations , on a stand-by basis , with support for its activities in the area of humanitarian emergency assistance , as well as in the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and development ,  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
These figures may demonstrate the extent to which the lives of innocent civilians in Iraq are at risk over and above the threats posed to them by the shortage of food and medicine and the adverse health situation owing to the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and by the Iraqi people 's lack of access to the most elementary and basic humanitarian needs .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
On this issue , it is important that we be clear about the goals of the sanctions imposed , the need for a timely agreement on precise conditions and machinery for lifting them once they have fulfilled their purpose , the inadmissibility of tightening sanctions if that would hinder the process of a political settlement , and the vital need to consider humanitarian factors .  
But if there is not strict and sacred adherence to them , we shall lose from sight the minimum flexibility that is indispensable to saving or protecting lives , particularly of civilians or of those who generously expose themselves to danger so that our Organization can accomplish its mission or so that humanitarian assistance can be given to those who are suffering the consequences of war .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
Affirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
Stressing also that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance provided in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking humanitarian assistance with economic aid for national reconstruction and development ,  
Impartiality can not lead to progress if it means accepting the blocking of humanitarian convoys and of the delivery of fuel and other aid , in order to benefit the aims of conquest and siege , being resigned to entire units of UNPROFOR being taken hostage and informing those who have shelled hospitals in safe areas when and where the cosmetic or proportionate airstrike against an offending tank will take place .  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
These have been the tasks of protecting humanitarian operations during continuing warfare , protecting civilian populations in designated safe areas and pressing the parties to achieve national reconciliation at a pace faster than they were ready to accept . 
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda , resulting in massive loss of life ,  
Also condemns in the strongest terms the kidnapping and killing of military peace-keeping personnel attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , the killing of personnel attached to humanitarian organizations operating in the country , the wanton killing of innocent civilians and the destruction of property during the conflict , which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules , as set out in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians from acts of reprisal and violence , including ill-treatment , torture and summary executions , and to expedite the simultaneous release of prisoners wherever they may be held ;  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ; 
It is also no longer acceptable from a legal , political or humanitarian point of view for an entire people to continue to suffer because of a mere suspicion that two persons may be connected with the bombing of an aircraft based on investigations that are not yet complete .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
As Chief of the Section the incumbent would be responsible for developing comprehensive country-based and regional humanitarian strategies , ensuring proper measures are taken for effective coordination of all aspects of humanitarian assistance programmes in those regions , including support on the ground , fund-raising initiatives and consolidated inter-agency appeals .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
We , Yugoslav physicians and other health workers , call upon all the progressive forces of mankind , and particularly cultural and humanitarian organizations , to raise their voices , guided by principles of humanism , ethics and democracy , against the perils of international sanctions imposed on the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and call for putting an end to that unique concentration camp in the world of today .  
A more precise understanding of the desertification issue would involve concerted activities , including consultations with major groups , at the national level in affected countries , and the recognition by Governments of its importance , that is , a cross-sectoral effort involving physical , social , humanitarian and economic factors . 
The Committee had clearly abandoned the question of recommending criteria for determining core and non-core posts with respect to posts to be charged to the support account and those to be charged to the regular budget , having concluded that such an approach might lead to endless controversy and might even complicate debate on other aspects of United Nations financing ; it had been informed that it might soon be seized with the question of core and non-core posts for humanitarian affairs .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
The representative of Iraq denies that his country refused to sign the minutes of the most recent meeting of the tripartite committee , which was held at Geneva on 7 April 1995 , and claims that none of the parties signed the document when Kuwait insisted on imposing political conditions that bore no relation to the humanitarian issue on which the meeting had been convened ;  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
Obviously , we all prefer peaceful means , but when brutal force is used the Secretary-General must have the right to use the resources available to him , in consultation with the relevant troop contributors , as stated in this resolution , to employ our resources in the most effective manner possible to meet the humanitarian needs of so many desperate Bosnian citizens and to achieve a lasting peace .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
Reports of rape and sexual violence constituting violations of international humanitarian law continue to be received , although to a lesser extent than earlier in the conflict .  However , the international community needs to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the sexual atrocities against women , children and men do not reoccur on the scale reported in 1992 and 1993 .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
The Secretary-General had stressed in his Agenda for Peace that only sustained , cooperative work to deal with the underlying economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems could place an achieved peace on a durable foundation .  
It was agreed that the forging of an integrated United Nations system approach in post-conflict situations could be greatly assisted by the development of a strategic framework combining political , humanitarian , economic and social areas of intervention .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
A humanitarian disaster of unprecedented proportions is taking place before the eyes of the entire world , which is also confirmed by the statements of the competent officials of international humanitarian organizations , causing not only humanitarian problems but exerting additional pressure on Yugoslavia 's economy already exhausted by the sanctions . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
At a time when the Croatian authorities have resorted to the cruellest means - massive armed aggression - with a view to realizing the basic premise of their policy , that is , the creation of the ethnically pure State , Mr . Grani _ is attempting to divert the attention of the international community away from the humanitarian catastrophe and tragedy of the Krajina Serbs who have been forced to flee their ancestral homes .  
Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .  
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
The central element of this information programme is the quarterly periodical Africa Recovery , which , along with briefing papers and other publications , focuses on economic and social issues of special concern to Africa and underscores the links between the peace-keeping , humanitarian and developmental activities of the United Nations in Africa .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
The central element of this information programme is the quarterly periodical Africa Recovery , which , along with briefing papers and other publications , focuses on economic and social issues of special concern to Africa and underscores the links between the peace-keeping , humanitarian and developmental activities of the United Nations in Africa .  
NULLThe meeting stressed the humanitarian element of the ever-growing problem caused by the presence of land-mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts and expressed deep concern over the serious social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLThe present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 997 ( 1995 ) of 9 June 1995 , by which the Security Council adjusted and extended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , authorized the gradual reduction of its troop level and requested me to report by 9 August and 9 October 1995 on the discharge of its mandate , the humanitarian situation and the progress made towards the repatriation of refugees .  
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .  
At the field level , a letter dated 31 July 1995 from the Emergency Relief Coordinator assigned responsibility for in-country coordination to the Disaster Management Team headed by the resident representative / coordinator , or any other mechanism established to deal with a specific humanitarian crisis .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
Welcomes the ongoing peace efforts and notes with satisfaction that fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles are to be included in the comprehensive peace agreements as indispensable elements to achieve a lasting peace ;  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Pinning the responsibility for the suffering of the population of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively on the " Pale regime supported by Serbia " , as deliberately stated by the Muslim representative , can not divert the culpability of the Muslim-Croat authorities and free them from their role in starting the civil war , which has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy and the continuation of the war option .  
Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , 
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;

It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .  NULL  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Australia was actively promoting more innovative and effective approaches to emerging refugee and humanitarian problems ; was willing to respond generously to humanitarian need in all forums and was committed to alleviating the plight of displaced persons and refugees , the resettlement of whom had contributed to shaping his country into a culturally diverse and tolerant nation .  
While welcoming the thoughtful use of military assets by UNHCR in relief operations , and other innovative solutions , his delegation was firmly convinced that violators of humanitarian law should be held individually responsible .

The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
In that connection , he reiterated that the increase in Iraq 's rate was unjustified since it ignored the country 's economic situation and the adverse consequences of the complete embargo imposed on it by the Security Council , since that embargo had deprived it of any source of income and rendered it unable to respond to the humanitarian and vital needs of the population .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;

Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;

invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .

Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,

Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Henze ( Germany ) : The report of the Secretary-General on violations of international humanitarian law committed by Bosnian Serbs in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most is a sad and particularly worrying summary of the current state of information on the key issues of missing persons , executions and the involvement of Bosnian Serb leaders and of Serbian paramilitary forces in those crimes .  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
The existence of landmines and other undetonated explosive devices in various regions of the world is a tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the security , health and survival of the local population where these deadly devices have been scattered .  These devices prevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and impede humanitarian operations and programmes , national reconstruction and economic development activities and peacekeeping operations .  
While drawing the international community 's attention to the irrelevant linkage between the implementation of the aforementioned resolution and recent events in northern Iraq , and to the humanitarian appeals inside the country , we call on Iraq to cooperate fully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees the effective and swift implementation of this resolution .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
The main purposes of the United Nations , as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter , include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The work of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) and other programmes and agencies in key social , economic and humanitarian initiatives outlined in the report are all of vital importance to efforts to improve the quality of life on the continent .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former sectors North and South in the Republic of Croatia , as described in the report of the Secretary-General , including killings of several hundreds of civilians , systematic and widespread looting and arson and other forms of destruction of property .  The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .  
As we express our concern today at the humanitarian situation and at the situation of refugees , we echo the concern expressed by the Government of Georgia last September during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , when it warned that the harsh conditions endured by more than 300,000 displaced persons scattered throughout the territory of Abkhazia apart from constituting a heavy burden upon the entire country are a factor for instability that blocks the consolidation of the peace process . 
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
In its report to me , the team concluded that , in the current context of violence and instability , United Nations guards would not be able to guarantee the security of humanitarian personnel in Burundi ; indeed , in the present environment , the guards could themselves become potential targets for extremist groups , thus intensifying the security problems already faced by the international humanitarian effort .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
We stress , however , that while UNMIH , with the generous support of the international community , has made a profound contribution to easing the harsh humanitarian conditions in Haiti and assisting in building its institutions , the ultimate responsibility for achieving lasting national reconciliation and reconstruction resides with the people of Haiti .  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
As we have indicated , three of them are out of service for lack of essential spare parts , which are supposed to be exempt from the provisions of resolution 748 ( 1992 ) for humanitarian reasons , and because of their advanced age and constant need of maintenance . inclement weather .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Under the general supervision of the Registrar , assisted by the Deputy Registrar ( D-1 ) , the service would include six legal officers responsible for : court management and judicial administration ( 1 P-5 ) ; international humanitarian law , criminal law and coordinating the work of legal clerks assisting the Chambers , and general administrative legal issues ( 3-P-4 ) ; and judicial administration in the implementation of directives on the assignment of defence counsel and legal research including in the area of witness protection ( 2 P-3 ) .  
Recalling also additional Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
The course covers the protection of the human rights of women in all pertinent areas , encompassing civil , political , economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues of humanitarian law .  
This gratitude also springs from the immense humanitarian efforts of the United Nations to bury the dead , care for the wounded , give shelter to families left with nothing and assist columns of desperate refugees fleeing aimlessly , hopelessly , driven forward by a war that follows on their heels , by a war that persecutes them in order to destroy them . 
The two sides consider that in preserving the main responsibility of the Security Council of safeguarding world peace and security , and in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter , efforts should be made to promote cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in preventing and mediating peacefully disputes and conflicts , and to promote more constructive and healthy coordination between the non-governmental organizations engaged in economic and social development , humanitarian assistance and other areas , and the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the above areas .  
The mission further recommended that Member States should be encouraged to support intensive and sustained efforts to develop a broad-based and independent media in Burundi as an essential complement to diplomatic , humanitarian , human rights and development efforts already under way .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Such steps included : lifting the blockade on the Palestinian territories ; refraining from violating the terms of the bilateral agreements including the imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law ; redeploying Israeli forces from Hebron ; establishing a corridor between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which would ensure contacts between the Palestinian territories ; releasing all Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons ; and pressing forward with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area B on the West Bank .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The course covers human rights protection of women in all pertinent areas , thus encompassing civil and political and economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues relating to humanitarian law .  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
In paragraph 2 ( b ) of its resolution 1995 / 56 , the Economic and Social Council urged the governing bodies of relevant organizations of the United Nations system to review , during the period from 1995 to 1997 , issues concerning the role and operational responsibilities , as well as the operative and financial capacities , of their respective organizations to respond , within their mandates , in the context of broad and comprehensive humanitarian programmes .  
The identification of the multiple actors ( United Nations , bilaterals , multilaterals , donors , non-governmental organizations , government authorities , beneficiaries , etc . ) and multiple levels ( international , regional , national , local ) engaged in humanitarian assistance response and the appropriate coordination mechanisms for these complex interactions will be addressed .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue . 
At the same time , the ministers reaffirmed the important need for continued and intensified international support , especially for efforts to halt the proliferation of weapons in Central Africa , to diffuse potentially catastrophic situations and to meet the critical humanitarian needs of millions of refugees and displaced persons in the area .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
The past year has seen the Tribunal take positive strides forward , tempered by the uneven cooperation which it has received from States and Entities of the former Yugoslavia and which , by the same token , tempers progress towards a new era of international implementation of humanitarian law .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Iraq also submitted several requests to the Committee with regard to the partial release of its frozen assets for various purposes , such as paying its dues to international organizations , including the United Nations , financing the publication of the Holy Koran in Iraq , covering the cost of its pilgrimage programmes , meeting legal expenses for court actions outside the country , maintaining Iraq 's diplomatic missions abroad and purchasing humanitarian and other supplies from other countries .  
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,  
It further invited Governments to consider the development of standard minimum rules for the humanitarian treatment of trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards , and to support comprehensive practical approaches by the international community to assist women and children victims of transnational trafficking to return home and be reintegrated into their home societies .  
In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
We need to ensure the proper observance of humanitarian standards for sanctions in order to minimize their detrimental effect on the already grievous situation of the broad segments of the Burundian population that have been worn down by a protracted and bloody conflict .  
Throughout the country , inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government are major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance and thus slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of tragedy in other areas .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
Regarding the proposed United Nations humanitarian programme for Somalia , the United Nations agencies at the country level have embarked on an inter-agency analytical and consultative process with a view to defining and reaching consensus on the role of the United Nations in the country over the medium-term , reflecting a common system-wide vision and outlining a set of broad objectives and strategies .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The need for close coordination and collaboration among humanitarian partners in Somalia has intensified over the past year in view of continued insecurity and instability , the absence of effective national counterparts , limited donor resources and the precarious humanitarian situation .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
Article 17 includes in the crime of genocide the imposition of measures intended to prevent birth within the group ; article 18 includes provisions that rape , enforced prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse constitute prohibited acts under this article ; and article 20 prohibits outrages upon personal dignity in violation of international humanitarian law , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment , rape , enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault .  
These include the protection and security of relief personnel and convoys ; clearance of OLS flights into southern Sudan ; the extension of the March 1994 and May 1994 IGAD agreements on OLS humanitarian assistance into areas of cooperation left unaddressed by those agreements , such as modalities for the delivery of relief supplies involving cross-line convoys and access to conflict-affected areas , as well as the modalities for monitoring compliance with the relative principles and procedures ; operational procedures for international non-governmental organizations based in Khartoum .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
The High Commissioner 's participation in the sixth extraordinary session of the Islamic Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina and her subsequent visit to OIC headquarters at Jeddah constituted a step forward in the two organizations ' common search for humanitarian solutions to the increasingly complex refugee situation in the OIC member States . 
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
However , it would be unfair to put the rebel groups , no matter what their role in the violence has been , on the same footing as a State which has ratified the major international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law and is therefore bound by strict obligations . 
While rebels or armed gangs are not similarly bound by these obligations , they nevertheless are required to respect certain humanitarian principles arising from international customary law and recognized by all civilized nations .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
Funding of humanitarian projects ; ( ii ) capacity-building ; ( iii ) internal and external training programmes ; ( iv ) creation of a conducive atmosphere for cooperation with international NGOs and United Nations agencies .  
To give free and unimpeded access to international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers to all areas where enforced or involuntary disappearances or cases of slavery , slave trade and similar institutions and practices , especially the sale of and trafficking in children and women have been reported ;  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
While civil servants in organs working directly with the humanitarian community are familiar with the respective roles played by the organizations , senior government officials told the Representative that apart from a few major agencies , other organizations and their activities were unknown to them . 
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
A realistic beginning could be to address a few selected humanitarian issues which , in recent years , have caused deep concern to Governments and unnecessary suffering to millions of people that could be mitigated or avoided if the world community were to ensure the observance of a set of basic rules of conduct . 
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Three critical factors would allow UNHCR to fulfil its role in ever more complex environments : respect must be ensured for its unique mandate of refugee protection ; a collective commitment to respond to emergencies and resolve humanitarian crises was essential ; and it was vital that UNHCR was fully equipped to carry out its mission .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Kenya has had a long and productive association with the AALCC , and it is therefore with pleasure that I address the Assembly on behalf of the Kenya delegation to express our warm thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and secretariat of the AALCC for their outstanding work in promoting interregional and international cooperation , supportive of the efforts of the United Nations , with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the progressive development and codification of international law as well as in economic and humanitarian matters .  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
The fourth preambular paragraph should read " Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , " and a new fifth preambular paragraph should be inserted , to read : " Paying tribute to those staff members who had endangered or lost their lives , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , " .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
My delegation highly appreciates the valiant and expeditious efforts of the Canadian Government in taking the lead and ensuring broad participation by the international community in the formation of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and the voluntary , orderly and safe repatriation of refugees .  
I refer here to the need to play a more effective role at the international level which means sending a multinational force and ensuring the flow of necessary humanitarian aid to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees on the basis of full respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and to the need for a broad African participation in any multinational force .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
The protection and humanitarian assistance provided to the child in the enjoyment of his or her rights set forth in the Convention , as well as in other relevant international instruments , including civil rights and freedoms and economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Please provide information on the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , including of a legislative , administrative and educational nature , to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to the State in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
In resolution 47 / 168 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to examine all possible ways and means to provide adequate qualified personnel and administrative resources to the Department of Humanitarian Affairs from within existing resources of the regular budget of the United Nations and , where appropriate , through the secondment of national humanitarian disaster relief experts .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations as set forth in the Charter is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 10 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,

The following changes had been made to the text : the fifth preambular paragraph stressed the need for consolidating the existing bodies of international humanitarian law and the need for wide dissemination and full implementation of such law at the international level ; the wording of paragraph 4 had been brought into line with that of the fifth preambular paragraph ; and , in paragraph 5 , the reference to " preventive measures " in the earlier text had been deleted .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali local and regional counterparts and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
The Centre will develop a detailed Mine Action Plan to set up an information management system to support data collection , analysis and distribution , in order to provide the data for adequate mine-awareness training and planning of eventual humanitarian mine clearance , and to coordinate , support and develop mine-awareness training of the population , including in UTO-controlled areas , of relevant governmental bodies , UNMOT , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .

This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,

Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
Supporting fully the efforts of the International Tribunal aimed at the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 , and demanding that States and parties to the Peace Agreement meet their obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunal , as required by Security Council resolutions 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 and 1022 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , including with respect to surrendering persons sought by the Tribunal ,

Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .

Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR , both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
In an exciting new development , the International Federation , non-governmental organizations , church agencies and the ICRC which between them are the end-point deliverers of some 95 per cent of international humanitarian assistance have come together to develop a second-generation code which will lay down minimal performance criteria for independent agencies and will define , for the first time , both a universal best practice for agencies and the quantity and quality of assistance disaster victims have a right to expect from assistance agencies . 
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
This is the response of the international community aimed at achieving a complete ban on these treacherous and barbarous weapons , which are contrary to international humanitarian law , so that future generations will be free from the suffering of today \ x { e5b8 } civilian victims , in particular children .  
The treaty represents a solid international humanitarian commitment to alleviate the cruel and indiscriminate suffering caused by mines which have been placed throughout the world , affecting innocent civilian populations , and also to provide assistance to facilitate their rehabilitation and their social reintegration .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
It will also include continuing financial contributions to the international community 's variegated activities in the humanitarian and economic and social fields , without which it will not be possible to restore lasting peace and security in the region .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
The Sudan urges the institutions entrusted with ensuring respect for international humanitarian law to institute an inquiry into the savage crimes committed by the Ethiopian Tigray forces against the innocent Sudanese prisoners and detainees in their possession , which have included physical liquidation , so that the perpetrators and war criminals implicated in these practices will not escape the justice of the law .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
When the Organization had assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it had also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal which was to bring to justice those individuals responsible for genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year . 
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 8 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 633 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Reed Brody ( United States of America ) as the third member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
By means of resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 28 March , the Council authorized a number of Member States to establish a multinational protection force of a temporary and limited nature to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The Committee could not approve a request dated 24 September 1996 from Jordan for the Committee 's authorization of one or more regular weekly flights between Amman and Baghdad by Royal Jordanian Airlines in order to carry United Nations personnel and for humanitarian reasons , that is , to transport the sick and elderly to and from Baghdad , to provide means of transportation for pilgrims in their pilgrimage to Moslem shrines in Iraq , and to transport medical , pharmaceutical and food supplies from Jordan .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .  
The responsibility for preventing involuntary displacement fell to the international community , which must also provide humanitarian and financial assistance to the affected countries , bearing in mind that such measures should be part of a comprehensive strategy to promote peace , security and economic and social development in the countries concerned .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
A considerable contribution to strengthening security in the Mediterranean could be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has accumulated sound experience in drawing up and implementing joint steps by participating countries to strengthen security and cooperation in the military-political , economic , humanitarian and other spheres that could also be drawn on for resolving Mediterranean problems .  
Through the daily briefings given by the Spokesman and the increasing number of one-on-one contacts with journalists , the Office provides authoritative and timely information on the daily activities of the Secretary-General , as well as on peacekeeping operations , peacemaking , humanitarian assistance and a wide range of economic and social issues .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
In order to develop a shared understanding of the problems and possible solutions , preparations for the formulation of the strategic framework include a comprehensive needs assessment on the impact of the humanitarian tragedy as well as the constraints imposed on the economic , social and developmental prospects for recovery .  
Insecurity in the northern and western regions of Rwanda , where numerous vulnerable populations are located , reduced the access of humanitarian workers to the areas , with accompanying reductions in the reach and scope of humanitarian programmes .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
The strategic framework for Afghanistan proposes a more holistic approach by the international community , whereby the political efforts of the United Nations inform , and are informed by , the international community 's social , economic and humanitarian priorities .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The international community has come to realize that only an integrated and holistic response to the issue of landmine contamination , and its multifaceted humanitarian and socio-economic consequences , is capable of bringing real and lasting benefits to those who are considered at risk from those weapons .  
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as another voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
The reform proposed by the Secretary-General is aimed at strengthening the leadership role of the Secretary-General , improving coordination among the various bodies active in each field , such as peace and security , economic and social affairs , development , human rights and humanitarian affairs , and ensuring greater cooperation among the different departments and programmes , in order to achieve a fully integrated and interactive United Nations .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
At the close of the Review Conference , the European Union pledged to continue to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines and to strive towards the goal of their eventual elimination as stated in resolution 50 / 70 O . The Union firmly believes that the international community at every level must intensify its efforts towards eliminating the causes of this international humanitarian disaster as well as getting to grips with its horrific effects . 
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and also requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
During the Representatives visit to Mozambique , it was emphasized that given the magnitude of the crisis and the very different situations in which the displaced found themselves , a comprehensive , flexible and multisectoral approach was required to address the diversity of needs faced by the displaced and that this task could best be accomplished by collaborative arrangements among the various humanitarian actors .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
More recently , with the rapid growth of mandated activities , the Secretary-General had been able to turn to Member States to provide gratis personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
The force would perform such duties as accompanying humanitarian convoys , protecting international humanitarian personnel , protecting some key ports or airports where humanitarian goods are expected to enter Albania , guarding depots and other places where humanitarian goods are kept , and securing safe corridors for humanitarian convoys on parts of national roads .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
The integration of Azerbaijan and Georgia , which are an integral part of Europe , into the European institutions will create broad opportunities for resolving political , economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems on the basis of universally accepted European standards ;  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
Invites Governments to accord standard minimum humanitarian treatment to trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards and , with the support of the United Nations , to formulate manuals for the training of personnel who receive and / or hold in temporary custody victims of gender _ based violence , including trafficking , with a view to sensitizing them to the special needs of victims ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
On 28 March 1997 , the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , by which it authorized the establishment of a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate in a neutral and impartial way the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aiming at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
However , a number of security incidents have hindered humanitarian activities in the central and southern regions of the country , while difficulties continue to be experienced with the free circulation of people in the areas controlled by UNITA in the northern and eastern parts of Angola .  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
By its resolution 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 , the Security Council decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 ( " International Tribunal " ) and adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General 's report prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) of 22 February 1993 .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
While the situation within that country has stabilized to some degree , owing to the deployment of the multinational protection force and to the efforts of various humanitarian agencies , it is anticipated that the restoration of political , economic and social order will take some time , even after the election that is planned for late June .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
While the operation is financed from income accruing as a result of a limited exception to the sanctions regime , the resolution prescribes numerous safeguards to be implemented in order to ensure that the humanitarian assistance is not used for purposes other than those specifically authorized and that it benefits , in equal measure , the needy civilian population as a whole .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance . 
The meeting expressed , inter alia , appreciation for the neutral and impartial way in which the multinational protection force , acting under Security Council resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , carries out its mandate and for the positive results so far achieved in guaranteeing the safe arrival of humanitarian aid .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
IASC has agreed that simple field-based monitoring systems should be established in all complex emergency situations in which the United Nations system is involved in order to facilitate accountability , to optimize utilization of resources , to avoid duplication of effort and to adapt to changing circumstances .  The establishment of the system will be an inter _ agency effort carried out under the leadership of the resident / humanitarian coordinator .  
Considering that the dedication of a year to the act of giving thanks gives us the opportunity to remember the fundamental importance of cultural diversity in the development of a rich and harmonious International life and that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as expressed in its Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems in economic , social , cultural and humanitarian areas without creating any distinctions for reasons of race , sex , language or religion ,  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 1 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 617 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Atsu-Koffi Amega ( Togo ) and Mr . Andrew R . Chigovera ( Zimbabwe ) to be respectively the Chairman and a member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
You have no doubt noted that , even after the submission of your report to the Security Council of 2 June 1997 ( S / 1997 / 419 ) , two of the members of the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , namely the United States and the United Kingdom , are continuing to raise numerous difficulties and obstacles to the proper implementation of the provisions of the memorandum of understanding by impeding the approval of contract applications for the purchase of food , medicines and other basic humanitarian requirements .  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Guided by the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations , particularly Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter , which stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion ,  
The General Assembly has recognized the importance of the collaboration of IOM in those activities by inviting it to participate on a regular basis in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , a group responsible for the formulation of system-wide humanitarian policy and for ensuring that complex emergencies are dealt with through an integrated strategic approach . 
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
When the Organization assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal , which is to bring to justice those individuals responsible for the genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian laws committed in Rwanda and neighbouring States .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
Iraq has announced that it stands ready to act in accordance with international norms and with the principles elaborated in the context of the work of the Tripartite Commission , and it has remained open to all the initiatives put forward by States and organizations that are not members of the Commission with a view to finding a speedy and definitive solution to this humanitarian issue .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
We are distressed about this downward trend , characterized by the widespread loss of human life and a worsening pattern of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
Increased efforts of the Catholic Church and others , along with better understanding of the international humanitarian norms among senior military officers , improved the overall quality of human rights monitoring in East Timor .  
There is growing recognition of the essential linkages between all aspects of external support for countries afflicted by conflict , whether political , humanitarian , developmental or human rights .  
Have established competence in relevant areas of international law such as international humanitarian law and the law of human rights , and extensive experience in a professional legal capacity which is of relevance to the judicial work of the Court ;  
Have established competence in relevant areas of international law such as international humanitarian law and the law of human rights , and extensive experience in a professional legal capacity which is of relevance to the judicial work of the Court ;  
Twenty-one per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 22 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation which is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation that is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
In conformity with its humanitarian ideal , his Government considered that the human dimension , especially the social , economic and cultural rights of the people , should be taken into account whenever sanctions were imposed .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
It expressed its grave concern over the situation of anarchy prevailing in the Comorian Island of Anjouan and the humanitarian problems caused by the fighting which broke out between opposing factions within the separatist movement .  
It is intolerable for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law to be violated , that minimal protection is not provided to civilians and non-combatants and that people are forcibly displaced for ethnic or religious reasons .  
In the framework of the three main items on the agenda political , economic / trade and cultural / educational / humanitarian matters our Governments will make proposals based on the values and interests shared by both regions .  
The existence of common historical , political , economic and cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and development of relations through bilateral and multilateral cooperation .  
Although international humanitarian law , refugee law and human rights law are often treated as separate branches of international law , they all have a common goal of protecting individuals from harm and should therefore be considered as complementary .  
The consequences of the current repressive approach not only affect the immediate humanitarian situation , they also have a direct and major adverse impact on the prospects for a just and lasting political solution .  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The State and conflicting parties are required to adhere to the humanitarian imperative and facilitate safe and easy access to endangered populations and affected areas for rapid provision of humanitarian assistance ;  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .  
Because the extensive use and destructive power of landmines have become critical items on the international agenda , the Secretary-General decided the issue should be addressed in the dual context of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations .  
Twenty per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 16 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Both parties to the armed conflict have disregarded the rules of international humanitarian law , particularly the rebels , who display unusual cruelty which is reminiscent of the massacres committed during the so _ called war of liberation against the Hutu refugees and which the Special Rapporteur , the joint mission of the Commission on Human Rights and the Secretary _ General 's Investigative Team were prevented from investigating .  
The right to a remedy 23 / is indicated to require that : ( i ) each State ensure that adequate remedies are available to any person claiming a violation of rights and ensure their right of access to these remedies ; ( ii ) each legal system provide prompt and effective procedures to ensure readily accessible and adequate remedies , and protection from intimidation and retaliation ; and ( iii ) each State provide universal jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation that is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
These two agreements and their follow _ up mechanisms provide a comprehensive response to the problems posed by anti _ personnel landmines , although the complete removal of the millions of mines scattered around the world will regrettably continue to be one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of the international community for the foreseeable future .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
Of equal concern to the international community is the growing threat faced by humanitarian workers , who risk their personal safety for the noble purpose of alleviating suffering and hardship .  
Finally , the promotion of the security of civilians , including the personnel of humanitarian organizations , also depends on concrete , decisive and courageous measures designed to halt arms flows towards zones of instability and conflict , be they light and small-calibre weapons , more sophisticated and heavier weapons or anti-personnel mines .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
We were responsible for convening the first periodic meeting on international humanitarian law , which in January 1998 dealt with the protection of humanitarian personnel and so-called unstructured conflicts , and also the expert meeting on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which in October 1998 considered general problems relating to the implementation of the Convention in general and in occupied territories .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
Underlines the importancethat relevant measures to ensure respect for the rights of the child in the areas of health and nutrition , formal , informal or non-formal education , physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration be included in emergency and other humanitarian assistance policies and programmes ;  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religious persuasion , association and movement and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national , regional and international levels , and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues , to the conduct of education , training and research in this field , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
On behalf of the Ministry of Human Rights , I extend my sincere thanks to the national human rights organizations and eminent Congolese civilians who , at the risk of their lives , have provided the Ministry with information on serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the eastern provinces , thereby contributing to the preparation of this white paper .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Against a background of violations of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law , the economic , social and cultural rights of the Congolese are being violated by looting , extortion and destruction of installations and property essential for the survival of the population .  65 .  Other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law deserve to be highlighted .  
The periodic humanitarian assistance in the form of food , clothing , footwear and medicines given by international and local charitable organizations , small enterprises and farms also plays an important role in aiding the needy , the elderly , the disabled , residential institutions and orphans .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
We welcome the newly established international legally binding norm on an APLs ban as a pivotal step towards a sustainable response to the global humanitarian crisis caused by their indiscriminate use in various parts of the world .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
Conducted seminars on the law of the sea , University of Dar es Salaam ( 1976-1980 ) ; attended numerous seminars at national and international level on constitutional law , humanitarian and human rights law , international law .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The overall situation at the end of 1998 was characterized by continuing armed conflict , the political crisis resulting from lack of agreement on the framework for durable peace , the continuing violations and denial of human rights and the deteriorating humanitarian situation , affected by the absence of international personnel of the United Nations agencies as well as others engaged in humanitarian work , and the reduction of resource flows .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
These developments present an opportunity to adopt a bold and imaginative strategy which would enable the international community to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Afghanistan while firmly adhering to the commitment to establish a framework for durable peace based on a realization of the human rights of all Afghans .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
In fact , it is quite the contrary : the fate of the Kosovars has become entirely incidental , and the humanitarian banner is being used as a cover for NATO 's attempts to destroy the present world order , which is based on respect for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations . This , in fact , is the big picture , not the fact that one single person is responsible for all of this . 
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
Mr . Qin Huasun ( China ) ( spoke in Chinese ) : China is deeply disturbed by the current humanitarian crisis in the Balkans and has profound sympathy for the over 700,000 Kosovar refugees who have been left homeless and separated from their loved ones .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
Jordans policy targeted the humanitarian dimensions of the refugee problem and focused on satisfying the basic everyday needs of the refugees and on furthering their political and legal rights to return or compensation in accordance with the relevant resolutions .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .  
The members of the Council also expressed their support for renewed and urgent diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military , political , security and humanitarian fronts .  
The members of the Council expressed concern over the sporadic renewal of fighting , and called on all parties to halt military operations , respect international humanitarian law and facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Numerous international documents have been severely violated by the unprovoked and illegal NATO aggression : the Charter of the United Nations , the humanitarian law provisions , especially the Geneva Conventions with the related protocols , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , provisions of international agreement in the field of the environment , as well as the basic proclaimed principles of environmental protection .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
While Mexico shares the outrage of the international community over the abuses of basic human , family and community rights , it has stated that the use of force , even inspired by the most noble humanitarian cause , leads to more violence and is hardly conducive to a lasting solution to problems .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
In this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , the focus has been on three parallel approaches : promoting respect for existing international humanitarian law ; promoting the establishment of the International Criminal Court ; and engaging the Security Council in efforts to identify innovative ways in which the Council , acting within its mandate , can strengthen its capacity to ensure the protection of civilians in conflict .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
Despite the surfeit of pious excuses that has been found to justify ethically the launching of this overseas colonial enterprise , and the pseudo _ juridical ( sometimes even openly anti-juridical ) reasoning which has attempted to defend it legally , there is irrefutable evidence that its clearly _ defined goals had nothing either humanitarian or civilizing about them .  
Providing support to develop coherent field-based humanitarian strategies , credible and successful consolidated appeals , developing a strategic monitoring capacity that supports resource mobilization efforts of the Emergency Relief Coordinator and strengthens the United Nations system accountability in complex emergencies and leading this process and focusing on management of all aspects related to the consolidated appeals process cycle ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
They include the need for effective demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into productive civilian life ; post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in stable and secure environments ; reform and capacity-building of police , judicial and penal systems ; and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law , including with regard to the use and transfer of small arms .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .  Over 45 NGOs , along with major bilateral donors , have committed personnel and resources to meet the immediate relief needs of the people of Kosovo .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
The Council expresses its concern , in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions , about the continuous erosion , in many cases , in the respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and principles , both in terms of denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need and through deliberate violence against all those protected under international humanitarian law , especially women and children .  
This is attributable primarily to the determined efforts of my Special Representative , supported by the Russian Federation as facilitator , as well as the group of Friends of the Secretary-General , in insisting to the sides that continuation of the status quo is not an acceptable option , and in encouraging and logistically facilitating bilateral contacts in the fields of culture , humanitarian issues and economic cooperation , as well as on political questions .  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
Appeal to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture , if possible on a regular basis , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide ,  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 20 May 1996 confirmed the exceptional and temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme which was intended to provide for the most urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who were subjected to collective punishment through the most vile regime of comprehensive sanctions in history .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) . 
General Blaki _ is charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity on the basis of his alleged responsibility as a superior in respect of the serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by members of the armed forces of the HVO against Bosnian Muslims in the area of central Bosnia during the period from May 1992 to January 1994 .  
With regard to the latter decision , the Trial Chamber stated that " [ international humanitarian law ] does not lay down synallagmatic obligations , i.e . obligations based on reciprocity , but obligations erga omnes ( or , in the case of treaty obligations , obligations erga omnes contractantes ) which are designed to safeguard fundamental human values and therefore must be complied with regardless of the conduct of the other party or parties . "  
In March 1998 , the Prosecutor proclaimed publicly that the territorial and temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal covered any serious violations of international humanitarian law taking place in Kosovo and stated that she was empowered to investigate such crimes .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
Pursuant to a recommendation contained in his report on the situation of internal displacement in Azerbaijan ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 79 / Add . 1 ) submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-fifth session after a mission to that country , a meeting was held in May 1999 with Government officials and representatives of the humanitarian , development and diplomatic communities with the aim of devising a common strategy to meet the immediate , medium - and long-term needs of the internally displaced . 
The cooperation between the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and OIC , through its subsidiary organs and its specialized and affiliated institutions , was closely continued in the social , humanitarian and technical fields and in their bilateral search for solutions to global problems in the region .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
Article 8 : A key role in the promotion of a culture of peace belongs to parents , teachers , politicians , journalists , religious bodies and groups , intellectuals , those engaged in scientific , philosophical and creative and artistic activities , health and humanitarian workers , social workers , managers at various levels as well as to non-governmental organizations ;  
I do not want to conclude without paying my delegation 's special tribute to the entire staff men and women of UNAMET and all other humanitarian personnel , particularly those who still remain voluntarily and courageously in Dili , for their tireless efforts , devotion and sometimes sacrifices that they have so valiantly demonstrated in the face of an extremely difficult environment throughout the process , since the popular consultation up to now .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
These are : insisting on the proposal to send an international security force ; adopting measures involving economic pressure on Indonesia at the multilateral and individual levels ; and providing , as quickly as possible , multifaceted , coordinated and duly protected international humanitarian assistance to the people .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
The United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone reported horrifying violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including the wilful killing and torture or inhuman treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
While the humanitarian operation achieved its overriding objective to ensure the security and meet the immediate life-sustaining needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees the multiplicity of actors , including bilateral actors , compounded the problems of providing a coherent , effective humanitarian response .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
The first is the pledge of $ 220-million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Kosovo and neighbouring countries ; and the second is a pledge announced yesterday in Tokyo for a preliminary $ 2-million to meet immediate humanitarian needs for East Timor , to be followed by further assistance in response to any future appeal , as well as substantial financial contributions to the United Nations trust fund to support the multinational force established by the Security Council resolution . 
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
Recognizing the critical role played by many other United Nations and non-United Nations bodies and humanitarian agencies in protecting civilians in armed conflict and in providing them with humanitarian assistance and all necessary relief , we stand by our position that the Security Council should be the guiding and coordinating organ in these international efforts .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;

My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
It is expected that , through this dialogue , innovative ideas will emerge regarding the specific goals that the United Nations should strive to achieve in the forthcoming decades , in particular in the five core areas of its work , namely , development cooperation , economic and social affairs , humanitarian affairs , peace and security , and human rights .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
A key role in the promotion of a culture of peace belongs to parents , teachers , politicians , journalists , religious bodies and groups , intellectuals , those engaged in scientific , philosophical and creative and artistic activities , health and humanitarian workers , social workers , managers at various levels as well as to non-governmental organizations .  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in West Timor : first , the Indonesian government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose - return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia - it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
The report of the second panel concerning the current humanitarian situation in Iraq ( S / 1999 / 356 , annex II ) , had referred to the qualitative dimension of the impact of the sanctions and to the cumulative effects of sustained deprivation on the psychosocial cohesion of the Iraqi population as indicated by an increase in juvenile delinquency , begging and prostitution , anxiety about the future and lack of motivation , and a rising sense of isolation .  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Firstly , the fourteenth preambular paragraph calls on all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in East Timor .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
Among the many pressing needs are the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of child combatants ; the protection and safe return of internally displaced and refugee children ; the provision of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations composed largely of women and children ; and the registration , protection and reunification of unaccompanied or orphaned children and children in foster families .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
The Under-Secretary-General stated that the Department viewed modules as main thematic areas of action and activities , such as peace and security , economic and social development , human rights , humanitarian assistance and environment , while elements were specific documents and public information products that better illustrated those thematic categories .  
In that connection , the Hungarian Parliament was expected to adopt a decision to reissue the four Geneva Conventions in a single document in the near future and a national interministerial commission on humanitarian law had been established as a practical means of ensuring the enhanced implementation of international humanitarian law in Hungary .  
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
The easier path towards an acceptable definition of aggression would have to recognize limitations imposed by the Charter , as well as practical limitations reflecting the need for the international community to respond to humanitarian and other crises without being harassed or , much worse , being charged with violations of the Statute .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
In paragraph 6 of resolution 1999 / 6 , the Commission requested the Secretary _ General to bring that resolution to the attention of all Governments , the competent United Nations organs , the specialized agencies , regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible publicity , and to report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ sixth session .  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
It was noted that favourable conditions for return could only be achieved if the fundamental causes of displacement were addressed and the State fully implemented the multiple recommendations made by the international community in regard to the protection of human rights and humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
The new UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The report lacks an objective approach to evaluating the repercussions of the implementation of the programme on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq in that it neglects to make a comparative analysis of the present situation and the situation in the relevant sectors as it was prior to the imposition of sanctions and in that it ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social and cultural aspects of life for the Iraqi people , including future generations .  
The representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom in the 661 Committee have held up contracts for this sector , which is one of a humanitarian character , that are worth a total of more than $ 60-million and which include 16 contracts for supplies that are essential and basic to the maintenance of existing water treatment plants and water compact units throughout Iraq .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
From the data gathered , the Panel calculated both an estimate of the total amount spent in the global emergency humanitarian relief effort for evacuees and an estimate of the total donations made to Jordan in cash or in kind and relevant costs that had been borne by other Governments and / or international organizations .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
The UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit , established in 1999 , will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continued coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross purposes ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
At its eighteenth session ( 17-28 May 1999 ) , the Board of Trustees of the Fund had recommended that , for the period June 1999 to May 2000 , grants of approximately US $ 5.1-million ( A / 54 / 177 , para . 16 ) should be awarded to medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian and legal assistance programmes , which were approved in June 1999 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of the Secretary-General ( paras . 18 and 21 ) .  
In paragraph 8 of the Declaration , the Committee against Torture , the Board of Trustees of the Fund , the Special Rapporteur and the High Commissioner appealed to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously and , if possible , on a regular basis to the Fund , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide . 
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
As soon as a list is drawn up , humanitarian items such as foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , as well as basic or standard medical and agricultural equipment and educational items , will no longer be submitted to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for approval .  
It is precisely for that reason that I , in my dual capacity as representative of the Netherlands and Chairman of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to Security Council resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , am relieved that the present resolution provides for a considerable enhancement of the humanitarian programme , which will be implemented irrespective of whether or not the Iraqi regime chooses to cooperate with the Security Council .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
As mentioned in my last report ( S / 1999 / 987 ) , UNMIK has also established other consultative mechanisms through which the local population and leadership have been able to participate in the decision-making of the interim administration by providing expert guidance and advice to UNMIK on specific issues , for example in the fields of legislative matters , humanitarian affairs , economic policy , health , education , energy and public utilities .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
One priority of the humanitarian pillar of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo , which is headed by my Special Envoy , is to help these people through the winter we are working hard , together with major governmental partners such as the United States of America , the European Union and Japan and many non-governmental organizations , to meet this deadline.But more intractable problems remain unresolved . 
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in western Timor : first , the Indonesian Government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
In this context , we believe that the General Assembly , as the sole democratic , universal and transparent organ of the United Nations , is the proper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications of the emerging debate on collective action to address humanitarian catastrophes .  
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
The obstacles experienced during the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the United Nations regarding the oil-for-food formula which all reports and realities indicate can not meet the essential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq are striking evidence of the American Administrations insistence on harming the people of Iraq and depriving them of their fundamental humanitarian rights , as enshrined in all international covenants .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
As the Secretary-General suggests , changing international circumstances including the spread of notions of individual rights and the idea that the international community has a responsibility to respond effectively to humanitarian crises are challenging traditional notions of national sovereignty .  
These include the shelter , management and social reintegration of tens of thousands of displaced persons , a humanitarian tragedy whose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the international community ; the protection of people and property ; the respect of human rights ; and the restoration of normal living conditions in many war-torn communities an overwhelming task that anyone would agree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a State bled dry such as Congo is today .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
In fact , the challenges of recent years have led the international community to provide pragmatic answers to many of the questions posed by the Secretary-General , not only by the regular actions of humanitarian agencies and the coordinating work of the United Nations , but also , in certain cases , by specific decisions of the Security Council and even by unilateral actions .  
Two requisites are fundamental to our endeavour : first , there must be absolute respect for the Charter and for the competence of the Security Council in the use of force in the international arena , which means consistent respect for the rules and for the process of changing the rules ; and secondly , the legitimacy of the international communitys response to humanitarian crises depends on its commitment to devoting equal attention to equivalent problems .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .  
In affirmation of the growing needs and common requirements of the member States of the OIC , General Assembly resolution 53-16 of 29 October 1998 called for the strengthening of cooperation between our two organizations in the political , social , economic and humanitarian fields , a detailed review of which is contained in the Secretary-General ' s report .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
As a staunch advocate of free trade and relations between nations , on the basis of respect for the norms and principles of international law , and consistent with its own cherished values and traditions , the United States clearly can not persist in its current policy against Cuba , with its serious humanitarian impact on the lives of the valiant Cuban people .  
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
At the same time , because of the rather numerous , complex and sensitive aspects involved , the issue needs to be appropriately considered through a comprehensive and level-headed debate in order to promote a more favourable atmosphere for humanitarian aid workers of the United Nations and its agencies , in accordance with the relevant rules and principles .  
We are convinced that the world Organization is the primary body responsible not only for the maintenance of international peace and security , but also for humanitarian assistance and for economic and social development , as set out in the Charter .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
As a logical consequence of the chronically unstable situation in certain parts of the continent and the constantly growing number of refugees generated by its convulsive conflicts , dealing with the humanitarian situation in Africa today is a major challenge to Africans and to the whole international community .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
Once again , the international community finds itself obliged to take action ; once again , Member States find themselves obliged to resume the tenth emergency special session in the face of Israel ' s intransigence and its insistence on continuing its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , in grave violation of international law , international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Measures such as these , and any others intended to alter the legal status and the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , are inherently null and void ; they are unlawful and in breach of the fundamental norms of international law and international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In what could well prove to be an exemplary effort to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement in war-torn areas , international humanitarian and development agencies , and financial institutions have forged partnerships amongst themselves and with the Government with the common aim of assisting the Government in creating possibilities for return as a durable solution .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .  
In recognition of the fact that they are based on existing human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , the workshop affirmed that the Guiding Principles do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a report on the status of the additional Protocols , as well as measures taken to strengthen the existing body of international humanitarian law , inter alia , with respect to its dissemination and full implementation at the national level , based on information received from Member States and the International Committee of the Red Cross ;  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .  
Torture is one of the vilest acts to be perpetrated by human beings upon one another.The proceeds paid in to the Fund will contribute to projects providing medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
WFP welcomed the Principles as a well-formulated consolidation of relevant elements of existing international human rights and humanitarian law , presented in clear , concise language which would increase international awareness of the specific problems internally displaced persons confront as well as the legal norms relevant to addressing their needs .  
Principle 25 provides that international humanitarian organizations and other appropriate actors have the right to offer their services in support of the internally displaced , that such an offer shall not be regarded as an unfriendly act or an interference in a States affairs and shall be considered in good faith , and that consent thereto shall not be arbitrarily withheld , particularly when authorities concerned are unable or unwilling to provide the required humanitarian assistance .  
Those approached for consultation include representatives of the office of the Secretary-General and of the ERC , relevant United Nations and other international agencies and organizations engaged in human rights , humanitarian and development work , and academic experts familiar with the issue of internal displacement and the mandate .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Strongly deploring the rising toll of casualties among humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , and strongly condemning the acts of physical violence and harassment to which those participating in humanitarian operations are too frequently exposed ,  
Reaffirms the necessity for humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel to be properly informed , inter alia , by their sponsoring organizations of the scope of their activities and the standards that they are required to meet , including those contained in relevant domestic and international law , and suitably trained so as to enhance their security and effectiveness in accomplishing their functions ;  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The religious denominations and non _ traditional religious groups in Azerbaijan engage in charitable activities , assist a wide variety of communities , provide humanitarian assistance and visit boarding schools , homes for the disabled , hospitals and places of detention , providing material and moral support .  
While it recognized the distinct nature of peacekeeping operations and humanitarian activities , it also saw a need to grapple with the unfortunate reality , which increasingly required the Department to take a proactive role in protecting humanitarian assistance in complex conflict situations .  
Participants recognized the important role played by migrants in their relations , and expressed determination to act , both at the multilateral and the bilateral level , to ensure that migrants from any country are treated in full compliance with human rights , basic freedoms and humanitarian principles .  
Contrary to the degrading , inhumane and brutal treatment of detainees held by the Taliban , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , in the light of the fundamental criteria of humanitarian treatment and respect for human dignity , has approached Taliban captives with care .  
The International Scientific and Educational Znanie Association is an international non-profit alliance of national and other non-governmental organizations which was voluntarily established and based on dissemination of scientific , technical and humanitarian knowledge for mutual benefit .  
The current conflict in the Congo has led to a deepening humanitarian crisis , exacerbated the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , impeded the delivery of critical food and medical assistance , and in general hampered international and domestic efforts towards development and democracy .  
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
The Nordic countries considered that the primary rules had now been codified in the major fields of international law , including treaty law , diplomatic and consular law , human rights law , the law of the sea and humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote cooperation between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
We remain keenly aware of the role that international law plays in the search for solutions to the problems of an interdependent world in which economic , social and humanitarian issues have assumed paramount importance .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
In the face of the major challenges posed by current humanitarian emergencies , it is our understanding that it is up to the Member States to adopt measures to provide political and logistic support so as to better meet the needs for assistance .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
The Republic of Korea shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about the human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
The legal ground for action is the United Nations Charter and international law , particularly international humanitarian law , the law of refugees and political , civil , economic , social and cultural human rights law .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Germany further supports UNSMA 's new Civil Affairs Unit , which will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
Furthermore , the teaching of human rights and international humanitarian law , adapted to each educational level , has not been incorporated into the curriculum as a compulsory subject .  
It has failed , for example , to address longstanding conflicts with massive human suffering and systematic violations of international humanitarian law in a timely and effective manner .  
The basis for the Security Council 's action is , above all , the recognition that flagrant , grave and systematic violations of universally accepted international humanitarian and human rights law may pose a real threat to international peace and security .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
The Council further stressed the importance of a coordinated international response to economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems , which are often the root causes of armed conflicts .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
It is a vexing and tragic mosaic of suffering , and its seemingly endless civil war exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation , as we heard in the briefing this morning .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
Although it acknowledged the complexity of the issue , his delegation considered that generalized violations of the rules of international humanitarian law that killed and seriously injured innocent civilians were impermissible .  
The Republic of Korea fully shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The mention of the existing legal framework , including the Charter , international humanitarian law and human rights and refugee law , although considered inadequate , appears to be comprehensive .  
Selfevaluation focuses on the subprogramme and can be applied to all sectors , including political , legal , humanitarian , economic and social affairs , public information and common services .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
An unflinching review must be the starting point for suggesting ways to initiate reforms designed to transform a tentative success into a decisive and irreversible step in the progress of international humanitarian law .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
Acknowledging the key role played by the United Nations under the Charter in the peaceful settlement of international disputes and in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character ,  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  
Its record was undeniable : it was democratically governed , it respected human rights , its people were energetic , imaginative and courageous and its economic power and humanitarian attributes were acknowledged around the world .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The first threeweek period of full control by these entities over Freetown marked the most intensified , systematic and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law against the civilian population .  
Encourages Member States to appoint suitably qualified female permanent representatives to United Nations missions and suitably qualified female heads of delegations dealing with major economic , social , security , human rights and humanitarian issues ;  
Strengthen the OAU institutional and human resources capacity in the areas of humanitarian early warning , rapid disaster response and the timely and effective coordination and interaction with member States and regional organizations in disaster situations ;  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Following positive reactions from a number of Governments and international organizations , BTF carried out a detailed feasibility study to define the exact scientific and associated financial requirements for the humanitarian cleanup of the hot spots .  
We believe that the additional Protocol is potentially the most effective legal instrument that the international community can use to resolve the humanitarian problems caused by the indiscriminate , irresponsible use of antipersonnel mines .  
Encourages Member States to appoint suitably qualified female permanent representatives to United Nations missions and suitably qualified female heads of delegations dealing with major economic , social , security , human rights and humanitarian issues ;  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
In the light of the intensifying fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation , I decided to convene a meeting of the six plus two group on 15 September at the level of foreign ministers .  
However , the tragic murder in August of seven Afghan workers of the United Nationssupported mine awareness programme by an unidentified armed band in western Afghanistan confirmed the everyday risks faced by humanitarian personnel .  
Within a short space of time , what had hitherto been internal , national provincial border has become international in nature , with all the political , legal , and not least social and humanitarian ramifications .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
It requires comprehensive strategies involving all relevant actors and embracing multiple sectors of activity , including political , military , diplomatic , development , human rights , humanitarian and many others .  
The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
National Governments and local authorities are called upon to respond properly and in a timely fashion to the political , economic , social and humanitarian circumstances that have the potential to lead to armed conflict or to the intensification of an ongoing conflict .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
Worthy of particular note in his report was the message conveyed to the Mission by the heads of State of the region , who thought that greater subregional integration in the political , security , economic and social spheres should remain a key objective for the United Nations family if durable solutions to conflict and to the tragic humanitarian suffering that accompanies conflict are to be secured .  
The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .  
In my delegations view , the mission sent a strong signal and conveyed the Security Councils genuine , unanimous determination to move ahead in the peace process , to put an end to the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to take up the question of the massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law that have been taking place on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the aggression began . 
Thus , the sanctions , the search for a political solution , and the humanitarian and economic efforts all need to be taken as a whole and pursued as parts of an integrated strategy leading to a broad based and responsible government in Afghanistan .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
While welcoming the fact that access to vulnerable populations is improving , we note that faltering security remains a constant threat to crucial humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts , as illustrated by the deplorable attack on six workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) in April .  
The political , economic , environmental , social , humanitarian , information and many other components of preventive activities are coming to the fore .  
In summing up , the basic issue before us today is the following choice between two alternatives : either we seize this opportunity to radically simplify and promote the flow of everyday civilian goods into Iraq , thereby establishing beyond any doubt that the international community is giving paramount importance to humanitarian concerns , while keeping sensitive goods under control ; or we preserve the status quo .  
It is clear that the Government of Iraq is indifferent to the humanitarian dimension of this issue , because it refuses to resume its participation in the meetings of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , whose meetings it boycotted in January 1998 on the basis of unjustifiable political pretexts despite the humanitarian suffering of those innocent prisoners , their families and loved ones .  
In this regard , we call on the Security Council and the international community to redouble their efforts to convince the Government of Iraq to be more forthcoming and positive in addressing this issue and to resolve the entire matter on humanitarian , religious and moral grounds and in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .  
In the meantime , we reaffirm our firm condemnation of the ongoing pillage of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which , according to credible sources , is the principal reason for the continuation of the conflict and for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The main objective of the Kindu deployment , which would be robust enough to deter any potential attackers , would be to establish a secure base from which civilian personnel who deal with disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , repatriation ( DDRR ) and human rights issues and provide humanitarian assistance would be able to go into the area to carry out their work .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
Although the sanctions were designed to specifically target the illegal activities of Liberias elite , and not intended to harm the lives of ordinary Liberians , the report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has confirmed the bleak humanitarian situation of the population in Liberia .  
According to Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction . . . .  
UNOMIG reported that in several regions of Georgia , including Abkhazia , one of the greatest threats to the local population , representatives of the international humanitarian organizations and United Nations personnel , seemed to come from loosely organized and poorly commanded paramilitary organizations , some of which may be supported by political circles while others were exclusively criminally motivated .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  They are also familiar with the territory and the peoples where they operate .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
First and foremost , they are to engage in dialogue with national and local authorities , in particular to impress upon them their primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law , as elaborated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement .  
Australia particularly deplored the human rights situation of women and girls in Afghanistan as a result of the Talibans strict social policies , and appealed to all Afghan factions to respect universal human rights standards and to abide by the principles of international law by allowing free and safe access for United Nations personnel to deliver vitally needed humanitarian aid .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
The reply describes emergency humanitarian assistance for the displaced population ; direct emergency humanitarian assistance for cases of mass displacement ; non-food aid for mass displacements ; individual and family humanitarian assistance ; and a scheme of independently-managed humanitarian assistance which is not confined to emergency humanitarian support but involves major investments to help restore the social and economic stability of the displaced population .  
It should also be noted that serious offences against international humanitarian law , as defined in the Criminal Code , are much more severely punished when members of the armed forces are accused , and acts formerly treated as ordinary crimes are also covered .  
It is our belief that the final goal of the implementation of the Dayton Accords should be the creation of a multi-ethnic , multicultural , united state of Bosnia and Herzegovina that is based on the democratic and humanitarian ideals of modern Europe and oriented in its development towards integration into the European Union and friendship and cooperation with other democratic States of the region .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
This will also include coordinating the development of common policies on humanitarian issues ; improving the management and practice of humanitarian coordination through the enhancement of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned ; ensuring that gender-sensitive strategies are incorporated in humanitarian action plans ; increasing support for and awareness of humanitarian assistance issues and international humanitarian law in the work of the United Nations and its Member States ; and intensifying resource mobilization .  
Emphasis will be given to ensuring a more timely and better coordinated response to situations calling for humanitarian assistance in the event of natural disasters and complex emergencies , providing improved support to the resident or humanitarian coordinators and implementing field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
The role of the Saudi Government in this matter is limited to providing a safe haven and economic , educational , social and religious services and health care on a fraternal and humanitarian basis .  
In response to that tragic situation , the Commission on Human Rights had convened its fifth special session from 17 to 19 October 2000 , at Geneva ; at that session it had adopted an important resolution condemning the provocative visit by the Likud party leader , which had triggered the tragic events , as well as the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by Israel , in violation of international humanitarian law .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Lebanese Government for the impartial attitude adopted by the United Nations in southern Lebanon following the recent Israeli threats in connection with this matter and to thank the Organization for UNIFILs continued fulfilment of its mandate and , in particular , for the humanitarian assistance and medical care it provides to the local inhabitants and for its active participation in the task of clearing the mines laid by Israel in the area .  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto ,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
The review revealed progress in a number of areas , including administrative reform and state modernization at the central level , capacity-building within national institutions for humanitarian coordination and community empowerment to promote participatory local development in selected provinces , with special emphasis on youth and women .  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its call upon the Russian Federation to establish , according to recognized international standards , a national broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate promptly alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation in order to establish the truth and identify those responsible , with a view to bringing them to justice and preventing impunity ;  
Expresses serious concern over the slow pace of investigating alleged serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians and notes with concern that very few such cases have reached the judicial system ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Urges the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure international , regional and national humanitarian organizations , notably those of the United Nations and their implementing partners as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross , free , unimpeded and secure access to the Republic of Chechnya and neighbouring republics of the Russian Federation , in accordance with international humanitarian law , and to facilitate their activities , including the delivery of humanitarian aid , inter alia by simplifying regulations , and their access to a radio communication network for the United Nations ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ,  
The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
The humanitarian consequences of the increasingly difficult operating environment include : reduced ability to work with or access women ; inability to reach populations that are a low priority for the Taliban authorities ; and generally increased costs or difficulty in implementing assistance projects to the extent that otherwise viable projects have to be considered for closure . 
France sought to justify its conduct in removing the two officers from the island of Hao on the ground of circumstances of distress in a case of extreme urgency involving elementary humanitarian considerations affecting the acting organs of the State . [ 70 ] The Tribunal unanimously accepted that this plea was admissible in principle , and by majority that it was applicable to the facts of one of the two cases . 
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
In contrast to economic , social and cultural rights , international humanitarian law is not subject to progressive realization , but must always be implemented immediately .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations , or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
However , it is now well known that SPLM / A , continuing its intransigent stance , not only vehemently opposed the proposed immediate ceasefire , but also provoked the situation by launching intensive military operations in western Bahr-El-Ghazal state , causing the loss of the lives of a considerable number of innocent civilians and the displacement of thousands of others , thus creating , once again , a humanitarian crisis in the state and its immediate environs , as it did in early 1998 .  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
The Advisory Group has also pursued the creation of a legal framework for international urban search and rescue operations , a project that received considerable support from Member States in the recently concluded humanitarian affairs segment of the Economic and Social Council .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
While , by their nature , countries and Governments could be held accountable for compliance with the relevant rules governing the protection of those engaged in humanitarian work , non-State actors continued to show complete disregard for them .  
The Sudan renewed its commitment to its position of principle advocating respect for the norms of international humanitarian law , bilateral agreements and national legislation on the part of all parties involved in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations , and it called for full account to be taken of the guiding principles for humanitarian assistance annexed to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
There was no doubt that the brutal imposition of comprehensive sanctions , exacting vengeance on an entire people , were a continuing flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter , of international law and of international humanitarian law .  
Ensure the selection , acquisition and maintenance of documents and publications regarding international law , international legal material , humanitarian law and national law relevant to the operations of the Tribunal for the use of judges , staff and defence counsel ; and provide online information services to assist staff , in particular the legal officers and judges , with legal research and greater access to bibliographic information ; ( b ) Conference and language support activities :  
The additional $ 276,631 will be divided among the survival , development , and protection and promotion programmes , with $ 100,000 being allocated to the survival programme to further increase access to basic health and nutrition ; $ 100,000 to the development programme in support of reaching large numbers of children through formal primary education ; and $ 76,631 to address advocacy with national authorities , civil society and the humanitarian assistance community on the rights of children and women .  
While the emergence of a broad-based and representative government through an inclusive participatory process may take some time , the failure to take the initial interim measures promptly , to meet urgent security needs and to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance could well jeopardize the entire process .  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Also encourages in such operations the sharing of geographical data , including remotely sensed images and geographic information system and global positioning system data among Governments , space agencies and relevant international humanitarian organizations , as appropriate , and notes in that context the work being done by the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters and the Global Disaster Information Network ;  
Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with voluntary expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers , or in coordination with it ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
We stress that determining the future of Afghanistan is the exclusive and inalienable right of the Afghans themselves , who are faced with the task of building a renewed State that lives in peace and harmony with its neighbours and the international community as a whole , and we call for increased humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and the elaboration of a broad international programme for the post-war restoration of Afghanistans national economy . 
Welcoming the timely preparation of operational plans by the United Nations in response to the latest humanitarian crisis , and affirming the urgent need to reinforce international emergency assistance to Afghanistan in order to alleviate the human suffering and restore basic services ,  
Urgently appeals to all States , the United Nations system and international and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , in close collaboration with the interim authority and Afghan civil society , when conditions on the ground permit , all possible humanitarian , financial , technical and material assistance for the Afghan population , especially in the areas most affected by the drought , as well as assistance to promote the voluntary , safe and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , in countries in which humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Mr . CUMMINGS ( United States of America ) said that the Convention was a strong , integral part of international humanitarian law , whose purposes it served largely by enlisting military , diplomatic and legal experts alike in the crafting of the rules it enshrined : as a result , those who had to wage wars were often also involved in regulating the weapons of war .  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian and development problems caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded ordnance that constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions , and that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-affected countries ,  
The role of the United Nations and the specialized agencies has also been emphasized , and the Organization has been requested to continue its efforts to assess the humanitarian needs in cooperation with our Government , relevant international and regional organizations and bodies and interested States , with a view to ensuring effective links between relief and long-term assistance .  
Respect fully international human rights law and international humanitarian law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls and take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence , particularly rape and all other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict , and end impunity and prosecute those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including those relating to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls ;  
Decides that the measures imposed by subparagraphs and above shall not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective use , and related technical assistance or training , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 14 below ;  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions , of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , to end the use of children as soldiers and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
At the preoccupying situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly in the eastern parts of the country , and at the continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including atrocities against civilian populations , committed , often with impunity , by all parties in the conflict throughout the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , while stressing in this context that occupying forces should be held responsible for human rights violations in territory under their control , and in particular condemns :  
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and particularly in the zones held by the rebel groups and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that the occupying forces should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control .  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in Ituri Province , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effects on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at the continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
The widespread violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law in Afghanistan , mainly by the Taliban , including the right to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , and the recruitment and use of children in hostilities contrary to international standards ;  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and particularly in the zones held by the armed rebels and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that all the forces present in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control .  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly in the zones held by the rebel groups and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that the occupying forces should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control . 
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , and condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in Ituri Province , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
The widespread violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law in Afghanistan , mainly by the Taliban , including the right to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , and the recruitment and use of children in hostilities , contrary to international standards ;  
The two countries ' foreign ministers called for the unconditional respect for the right of the people of all countries to choose social systems , value concepts , and ways of development in line with their countries ' conditions .  They considered the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries on humanitarian grounds and in the name of protecting human rights constitute acts that violate the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter .  
In 1999 , the US-led NATO disregarded the norm of International Law and bypassed the UNSC and frenziedly bombed a sovereign state-the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for as long as 78 days , causing the biggest humanitarian disaster in Europe since the World War II , killed more than 2,000 innocent civilians , and wounded more than 6,000 people .  Some one-million people lost their homes and more than two-million people lost their sources of income .  The direct economic losses reached $ 600-billion yuan .  
All countries should have the right to act in line with their native national conditions to choose their respective political systems and development models .  No nation or group of states has the right to force its values and social system onto others , even less so to exploit the human rights matter or a so-called " humanitarian crisis " as an excuse to deliberately interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
Law Suk-ching , a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC , said : By allowing the US crew to leave China , China has based itself on a humanitarian stance , taken the overall situation into consideration , been devoted to maintaining long-term China-US relations , and safeguarded China 's major task of reform , opening up , and economic construction .  All this has shown China 's diplomatic skills in proficiently handling complicated international issues .  
The Japanese Government has ignored repeated solemn representations of the Chinese Government and calls for justice from within Japan and decided on the evening of 20 April to issue a Japanese visa to Lee Teng-hui , on the excuse of so-called " humanitarian grounds " and " non-involvement in political activities and being limited to medical purposes , " thereby giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
In his May 20 speech , he indicated the intention to " continually strengthen substantive diplomatic relations with friendly countries , " and also declared , in an undisguised manner , that Taiwan " will vigorously participate in various international nongovernment organizations and take an active part in international affairs through such diverse means as humanitarian concerns , economic and trade cooperation , and cultural exchanges , so as to expand Taiwan 's space for survival internationally . "  
Wang noted that the UN should make more positive contributions to preventing massive humanitarian crises and the tragic mass killings of innocent civilians .  At the same time , it should be fully aware of the complexity of international intervention and the risk of inappropriate intervention .  
They embody the spirit of being highly responsible to the cause of the party and the people , the spirit of faithfully performing duties and making selfless dedications , the humanitarian spirit of being friendly toward people and being patient in helping people being obsessed and misled by the evil cult , the spirit of defending science and upholding the truth , the spirit of fearing no difficulty and daring to undertaking difficult tasks , and the spirit of being responsible and doing down-to-earth work .  
From a humanitarian standpoint , it is this earnest desire to lead a life in a free , democratic society that has earned the people 's sympathy . Finally after one year , three months and one week the six patriots finally realized the fulfillment of their long cherished dream - - their sentences were suspended and they were allowed to go to their homeland , the Republic of China .  
If the two sides could arrive at an acceptance of the present situation and a shared understanding about the future , this would not only broaden the scope for mutual tolerance and benefit , it would also allow the philanthropic ideal of " caring for others as for one 's own , " so long stressed in Chinese culture , to be expressed in the international arena in the form of humanitarian assistance .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The achievement of a well-coordinated and coherent response requires the cooperation of the principal bodies concerned , be they of a political , humanitarian or specialized economic and social nature .  
The rapid start-up of a coherent , effective mine-clearance programme therefore implies very close coordination of the various United Nations bodies responsible for humanitarian assistance and economic and social recovery .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
The most pressing financial questions before the United Nations involve paying the bills for ongoing operations and raising the funds to pay for its foreseeable obligations in peace-keeping , humanitarian relief and sustainable development .  
Mexico 's drug control policy is founded on the humanitarian principle of protection of the individual , with strict adherence to law and supported by the legal , organizational and functional soundness of national institutions .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
In that context , the Council requested the " Secretary-General to direct urgent preparation of a detailed plan with concrete steps setting out UNOSOM II 's future concerted strategy with regard to its humanitarian , political and security activities " .  
This active role of the Organization , in bilateral and multilateral negotiations alike , should extend to the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian spheres .  
He was aware that the United Nations and certain of its organs had specific needs , such as peacekeeping and humanitarian activities , and considered that special statutory provisions should be applied in those cases .  
The independent Commission of Experts concluded that even though the conflict in Rwanda was a domestic one its consequences affected the entire international community , inasmuch as fundamental principles of international humanitarian law were violated .  
Based on these logistical factors , the existing UNOSOM aircraft fleet is not sufficient to meet current military and humanitarian requirements within Somalia .  
The Committee reaffirmed that those responsible for massive , gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted .  
Nongovernmental organizations are established through the voluntary association and decision of private individuals or groups for a variety of purposes , which may be political , humanitarian , religious , professional or simply associative .  
Several major cities remained under siege , encircled or under sustained military pressure by one or the other side , resulting in increased hardship for the civilian population and compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation .  
Both sides demonstrated a sincere concern to resolve the complex set of political , military , humanitarian and socioeconomic problems arising from the political confrontation and civil war in the Republic of Tajikistan .  
Only sustained , cooperative work on the underlying economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems can place an achieved peace on a durable foundation .  
The flagrant disregard for basic human rights and international humanitarian law is continuing to expand the range of human suffering , often placing fragile political and social structures in neighbouring regions and countries under unbearable pressure .  
In contrast , in many African countries the humanitarian crises manifest a low point in a continuing process of structural deterioration compounded by internal conflict or externally induced destabilization .  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
Expressing once again its grave concern at the continuing reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including acts of genocide , have been committed in Rwanda ,  
These provoked a massive stampede of refugees across the border into Zaire in the northwest , overwhelming humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) whose preparations had anticipated the simultaneous movement of refugees further south .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
Mr . MARTENS ( Federal Republic of Germany ) said that the need for detailed rules of humanitarian law , unnecessary in an ideal world , had been clearly demonstrated by the recent escalation of internal and international armed conflicts .  
A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;  
Since international public support was a necessary prerequisite for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions , the number of which was increasing , an effective information and communication component was essential to their success .  
The large number of regional conflicts in which international humanitarian law and human rights were seriously violated indicated that there was an urgent need to take practical steps to achieve a form of universal criminal jurisdiction .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
Its implementation required a broad partnership of national , regional and international actors to be coordinated by UNHCR , which must preserve its nonpolitical and humanitarian approach .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
The Commission shall create a database intended to be a complete and standardized record on alleged grave violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of Rwanda including possible acts of genocide .  
There is no doubt that humanitarian law has been violated and that cultural monuments have been destroyed by all three parties in the tragic civil , ethnic and religious war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
It coordinated and monitored humanitarian assistance operations , provided technical assistance to and verified the entire electoral process , culminating in the holding of free and fair elections on 27 to 29 October 1994 .  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
In view of the increasing use of United Nations peace-keeping operations in support of humanitarian activities , the High Commissioner recognized the need for improved understanding , new doctrines and operational procedures , and new mutually advantageous systems for coordination between UNHCR and the military .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Based on the agreement concluded between the two organizations , we have indeed developed flexible forms of cooperation , not only in the political area , but in our joint efforts on humanitarian issues , human rights , sanctions-monitoring and operational presence .  
Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of the Second World War fell silent , one notes with satisfaction the valuable work performed by the United Nations as a forum for debate on matters of international concern , and as a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
Indeed , beyond the simple maintenance of international peace and security , the Organization remarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for decolonization , but , above all , in the establishment of a progressive system of specialized agencies , all of which provide highly valued assistance in the social , economic , humanitarian and cultural fields .  
Despite the end of the cold war , which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict , the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies .  
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
We also applaud the focus the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security , for example , in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance , effective governance and the key social issues which formed the agenda of the World Summit on Social Development .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
We call upon the international community to contribute fully to the definition and implementation of the new role of the United Nations , which undoubtedly is of a humanitarian nature , and aims at protecting and preserving life on our planet and at raising the standard of living of all peoples , through the establishment of a new , balanced and equitable international economic and social order .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations , as enshrined in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
The IPU has played a very positive and active role in supporting United Nations efforts in various parts of the world , in various conflicts and in the fields of disarmament , international humanitarian law , economic and social development , the environment and the advancement of women , as well as its important role in enhancing democracy .  
The Charter establishes an important and immediate link between the cooperation necessary in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and the promotion and encouragement of and respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
Elsewhere in the draft resolution 's operative part , the Secretary-General is requested to continue to deploy his efforts towards strengthening cooperation and coordination between the two organizations and their specialized agencies in order for the two organizations to enhance their capacity to serve their mutual interests in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields .  
The agenda of the latest meeting between the two organizations included a number of issues of paramount importance , including political questions , such as the maintenance of international peace and security ; humanitarian issues , such as mine clearance ; and such economic and social issues as desertification control , protection of the environment , sustainable development , narcotics control and crime prevention .  
To meet the growing need for civilian personnel during crises , Canada will offer the United Nations secondment or the loan of civilian personnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the development of a fully trained capacity in the areas of human rights , legal advice , humanitarian assistance , and other aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises . 
Sudan 's multidimensional cooperation with the international community as represented by the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations in ensuring the flow of humanitarian assistance has been the subject of special appreciation by the United Nations as demonstrated in General Assembly resolutions and in the Secretary-General 's report which underscores the success of OLS in assisting all the needy .  
In considering the continuum with respect to systematic breakdowns or societal implosion , the matter becomes more complicated in the sense that the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance in contributing to rebuilding a society decimated by conflict depends on how effectively the underlying political problems of such emergencies have been addressed .  
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
At the same time , it is clear that the magnitude of the Chernobyl disaster in terms of a humanitarian tragedy , especially in the present economic and social context , has given rise to new and additional problems of general concern which , if they are to be resolved , require the establishment of broad-based and active international cooperation and the coordination of efforts in this sphere at the national and international levels .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
These figures highlight the fact that this is not a static problem ; it is a recurring humanitarian crisis that is worsening day by day and requires greater efforts and political will if we are to put an end to this inhumane situation in which human lives are destroyed , as is the environment as a whole .  
In addition , the European Union adopted , on 18 September , a common position with the aim of fostering the adoption of a new protocol on blinding lasers , which satisfies the humanitarian concern to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
The European Union takes note of the progress made during the first part of the Review Conference , held in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October , with the adoption of a new Protocol IV on blinding laser weapons , which responds to humanitarian concerns to avoid unnecessary suffering without limiting the legitimate military use of lasers .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Recognizing , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies , the need to utilize fully the national potential of countries in providing the United Nations , on a stand-by basis , with support for its activities in the area of humanitarian emergency assistance , as well as in the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and development ,  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-19 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 20 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
These figures may demonstrate the extent to which the lives of innocent civilians in Iraq are at risk over and above the threats posed to them by the shortage of food and medicine and the adverse health situation owing to the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and by the Iraqi people 's lack of access to the most elementary and basic humanitarian needs .  
The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) had to be drastically reduced , the humanitarian situation worsened , and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOMOG ) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country . 
She concluded by stressing the need for the strict observance in the occupied territory of international human rights instruments and humanitarian law , particularly as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , since such instruments were the sole guarantee of the promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people and were the instruments on which the Palestinian people relied for justice .  
On this issue , it is important that we be clear about the goals of the sanctions imposed , the need for a timely agreement on precise conditions and machinery for lifting them once they have fulfilled their purpose , the inadmissibility of tightening sanctions if that would hinder the process of a political settlement , and the vital need to consider humanitarian factors .  
But if there is not strict and sacred adherence to them , we shall lose from sight the minimum flexibility that is indispensable to saving or protecting lives , particularly of civilians or of those who generously expose themselves to danger so that our Organization can accomplish its mission or so that humanitarian assistance can be given to those who are suffering the consequences of war .  
In cases where a peace-keeping operation has been necessary , we believe it is legitimate and useful for the United Nations to maintain a presence on the ground after the end of the operation in order to ensure that its action is followed up in such a way as to contribute to a lasting restoration of peace through measures for coordinated consolidation in the economic , social , institutional , electoral , humanitarian and human rights fields .  
Affirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
Stressing also that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance provided in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking humanitarian assistance with economic aid for national reconstruction and development ,  
Impartiality can not lead to progress if it means accepting the blocking of humanitarian convoys and of the delivery of fuel and other aid , in order to benefit the aims of conquest and siege , being resigned to entire units of UNPROFOR being taken hostage and informing those who have shelled hospitals in safe areas when and where the cosmetic or proportionate airstrike against an offending tank will take place .  
His report was thus based on the information that he had gathered in those countries , on numerous reports of United Nations bodies and humanitarian organizations active in the southern Sudan and on detailed reports from reliable sources concerning the situation of human rights in the northern and southern regions of the Sudan .  
These have been the tasks of protecting humanitarian operations during continuing warfare , protecting civilian populations in designated safe areas and pressing the parties to achieve national reconciliation at a pace faster than they were ready to accept . 
In his 4 November 1994 report ( paras . 79-86 ) , the Special Rapporteur concluded , inter alia , that Bosnian Serb de facto authorities continued to be responsible for large-scale violations of human rights and , both directly and indirectly , for displacement of people from areas under their control , for systematic military attacks on civilians in the " safe areas " and elsewhere , and for grave disruption of humanitarian aid and medical evacuation programmes .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
My delegation is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General for his excellent report ( S / 1995 / 97 ) , dated 1 February 1995 , which has provided valuable insights into the continuing problems in Angola in the political , military , civil and humanitarian spheres .  
In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
With regard to military operations , until such time as a cease-fire is agreed to and takes effect , URNG insists on the commitment to respect the provisions of the comprehensive agreement on human rights intended to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population , protect human rights and facilitate the work of MINUGUA and of all national bodies devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights and the rights deriving from international humanitarian law .  
Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda , resulting in massive loss of life ,  
Also condemns in the strongest terms the kidnapping and killing of military peace-keeping personnel attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , the killing of personnel attached to humanitarian organizations operating in the country , the wanton killing of innocent civilians and the destruction of property during the conflict , which constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law ;  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules , as set out in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto , of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians from acts of reprisal and violence , including ill-treatment , torture and summary executions , and to expedite the simultaneous release of prisoners wherever they may be held ;  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
In view of the evolving mandate of the United Nations in the fields of economic and social development , peace-keeping and peacemaking , human rights and humanitarian assistance , the availability of print materials for public information is an increasingly crucial aspect of the promotion of an informed understanding and effective support for the work of the United Nations .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ; 
It is also no longer acceptable from a legal , political or humanitarian point of view for an entire people to continue to suffer because of a mere suspicion that two persons may be connected with the bombing of an aircraft based on investigations that are not yet complete .  
Without the active support of the Somali people , it is unlikely that future humanitarian programmes will meet with much success , and more than likely that the gains , made through the combined efforts of international agencies and committed Somali partners , will be undone .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
As Chief of the Section the incumbent would be responsible for developing comprehensive country-based and regional humanitarian strategies , ensuring proper measures are taken for effective coordination of all aspects of humanitarian assistance programmes in those regions , including support on the ground , fund-raising initiatives and consolidated inter-agency appeals .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
We , Yugoslav physicians and other health workers , call upon all the progressive forces of mankind , and particularly cultural and humanitarian organizations , to raise their voices , guided by principles of humanism , ethics and democracy , against the perils of international sanctions imposed on the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and call for putting an end to that unique concentration camp in the world of today .  
A more precise understanding of the desertification issue would involve concerted activities , including consultations with major groups , at the national level in affected countries , and the recognition by Governments of its importance , that is , a cross-sectoral effort involving physical , social , humanitarian and economic factors . 
The Committee had clearly abandoned the question of recommending criteria for determining core and non-core posts with respect to posts to be charged to the support account and those to be charged to the regular budget , having concluded that such an approach might lead to endless controversy and might even complicate debate on other aspects of United Nations financing ; it had been informed that it might soon be seized with the question of core and non-core posts for humanitarian affairs .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
The representative of Iraq denies that his country refused to sign the minutes of the most recent meeting of the tripartite committee , which was held at Geneva on 7 April 1995 , and claims that none of the parties signed the document when Kuwait insisted on imposing political conditions that bore no relation to the humanitarian issue on which the meeting had been convened ;  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
Obviously , we all prefer peaceful means , but when brutal force is used the Secretary-General must have the right to use the resources available to him , in consultation with the relevant troop contributors , as stated in this resolution , to employ our resources in the most effective manner possible to meet the humanitarian needs of so many desperate Bosnian citizens and to achieve a lasting peace .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
Reports of rape and sexual violence constituting violations of international humanitarian law continue to be received , although to a lesser extent than earlier in the conflict .  However , the international community needs to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the sexual atrocities against women , children and men do not reoccur on the scale reported in 1992 and 1993 .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
The Secretary-General had stressed in his Agenda for Peace that only sustained , cooperative work to deal with the underlying economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems could place an achieved peace on a durable foundation .  
It was agreed that the forging of an integrated United Nations system approach in post-conflict situations could be greatly assisted by the development of a strategic framework combining political , humanitarian , economic and social areas of intervention .  
After four years of the utmost patience and restraint , the Republic of Croatia accurately concluded that the least costly solution for both Croatia and the international community to end Croatia 's agony and the international community 's humanitarian concerns in Bosnia and Herzegovina would require a limited but credible use of force that would end the siege of Bihac and restore order in adjacent occupied territories of Croatia .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Thus , while we fully share the pain and suffering experienced by the peoples of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia because of the wars raging in their countries , we have at the same time maintained a balanced position vis - - vis the conflicts in those countries .  We have joined in the condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law committed in these conflicts irrespective of who may have committed them .  
A humanitarian disaster of unprecedented proportions is taking place before the eyes of the entire world , which is also confirmed by the statements of the competent officials of international humanitarian organizations , causing not only humanitarian problems but exerting additional pressure on Yugoslavia 's economy already exhausted by the sanctions . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
At a time when the Croatian authorities have resorted to the cruellest means - massive armed aggression - with a view to realizing the basic premise of their policy , that is , the creation of the ethnically pure State , Mr . Grani _ is attempting to divert the attention of the international community away from the humanitarian catastrophe and tragedy of the Krajina Serbs who have been forced to flee their ancestral homes .  
Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
The content of the reports was similar to that of others reviewed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia and by the thematic rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the right to life and the physical integrity of persons , as well as by other United Nations organs and agencies that are attempting to devise a peaceful , just and lasting solution to the conflict and that are engaged in human rights or humanitarian relief activities .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
At the initiative of Yugoslavia , a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held at Belgrade in February 1988 which laid down the foundations for the process of multilateral cooperation among the countries of the region and opened up perspectives for better understanding and cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and humanitarian fields .  
In current conflicts , peace-keeping operations may benefit from using modern technologies to gather information ( weight , heat and infra-red remote-sensing devices ) , to detect and defuse mines ( infra-red , ground-penetrating radar ) , to improve communications and inter-operability among multinational United Nations forces , to equip blue helmets with more effective military means while causing a minimum of damage to humans , and to assist in humanitarian efforts .  
The international community , by providing massive humanitarian assistance during the civil conflict and fielding a peace-keeping operation in support of the Lusaka Protocol , has demonstrated remarkable solidarity with the people of Angola in their aspirations for a secure and prosperous future .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
The central element of this information programme is the quarterly periodical Africa Recovery , which , along with briefing papers and other publications , focuses on economic and social issues of special concern to Africa and underscores the links between the peace-keeping , humanitarian and developmental activities of the United Nations in Africa .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
The central element of this information programme is the quarterly periodical Africa Recovery , which , along with briefing papers and other publications , focuses on economic and social issues of special concern to Africa and underscores the links between the peace-keeping , humanitarian and developmental activities of the United Nations in Africa .  
NULLThe meeting stressed the humanitarian element of the ever-growing problem caused by the presence of land-mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts and expressed deep concern over the serious social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries .  
Whereas the focus has been on the provision of humanitarian assistance to those people , the countries receiving the refugees , despite their limited resources , have made substantial contributions by accepting the refugees and assisting in catering to their essential needs , while experiencing rising social tension and suffering nearly irreparable environmental degradation , notably in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire . 
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLThe present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 997 ( 1995 ) of 9 June 1995 , by which the Security Council adjusted and extended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , authorized the gradual reduction of its troop level and requested me to report by 9 August and 9 October 1995 on the discharge of its mandate , the humanitarian situation and the progress made towards the repatriation of refugees .  
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
If , however , the country is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum standards required by humanitarian or human rights law , then these guarantees may have to be met through international assistance .  
At the field level , a letter dated 31 July 1995 from the Emergency Relief Coordinator assigned responsibility for in-country coordination to the Disaster Management Team headed by the resident representative / coordinator , or any other mechanism established to deal with a specific humanitarian crisis .  
Accordingly , special attention had been paid to strengthening the Organization 's capacity to deal with political and peace-keeping activities , reinforcing international and regional cooperation for development , enhancing support for human rights and humanitarian activities , and increasing internal oversight capacity .  
Welcomes the ongoing peace efforts and notes with satisfaction that fundamental humanitarian and human rights principles are to be included in the comprehensive peace agreements as indispensable elements to achieve a lasting peace ;  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
But let me not be misunderstood : while we are deeply worried about the situation in Croatia , we are fully aware of the different qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica , Zepa and the wider Banja Luka area .  
The Indonesian delegation shares the deep concern expressed in the draft resolution regarding the continuing violation of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia , as well as the potential consequences for the peace process if this terrible and tragic situation is not expeditiously dealt with .  
Gravely concerned at reports , including by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape , and deportation of civilians ,  
Pinning the responsibility for the suffering of the population of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively on the " Pale regime supported by Serbia " , as deliberately stated by the Muslim representative , can not divert the culpability of the Muslim-Croat authorities and free them from their role in starting the civil war , which has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy and the continuation of the war option .  
Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , 
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , 
It is one of the purposes of the United Nations , in virtue of the Charter , " to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " ( Art . 1 , para .  NULL  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Australia was actively promoting more innovative and effective approaches to emerging refugee and humanitarian problems ; was willing to respond generously to humanitarian need in all forums and was committed to alleviating the plight of displaced persons and refugees , the resettlement of whom had contributed to shaping his country into a culturally diverse and tolerant nation .  
While welcoming the thoughtful use of military assets by UNHCR in relief operations , and other innovative solutions , his delegation was firmly convinced that violators of humanitarian law should be held individually responsible .  
" Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , 
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
In that connection , he reiterated that the increase in Iraq 's rate was unjustified since it ignored the country 's economic situation and the adverse consequences of the complete embargo imposed on it by the Security Council , since that embargo had deprived it of any source of income and rendered it unable to respond to the humanitarian and vital needs of the population .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in the social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
invoking the data from the reports of the previous Special Rapporteur , with whom the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia severed all relations because of his proven partiality , the authors of draft resolution A / C . 3 / 50 / L . 46 wish to portray that in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there are " massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law " .  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights field operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,

also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
gravely concerned at reports , including by the Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Henze ( Germany ) : The report of the Secretary-General on violations of international humanitarian law committed by Bosnian Serbs in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most is a sad and particularly worrying summary of the current state of information on the key issues of missing persons , executions and the involvement of Bosnian Serb leaders and of Serbian paramilitary forces in those crimes .  
it is of the utmost importance that the same legal standards , the same norms of law and the same critical objectivity are applied everywhere be it in the areas in question , in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere in this world .  There must be no selectivity , no attempts to either diminish or enlarge violations of international humanitarian law committed by one side for partisan reasons of political convenience .  
fact , through the draft resolution before us , members of the Council have the opportunity to express , in a united voice and in the strongest possible terms , their condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia , demanding that all concerned , particularly the Serbs , comply fully with their obligations in this regard .  
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
It was essential for the international community to define and implement a global approach to refugee problems , based on prevention , the reduction of the negative effects of the presence of refugees on the host country and the search for durable solutions , in order to alleviate the suffering of millions of human beings and prevent other humanitarian crises .  
delegation was fully convinced that economic development alone was not enough to prevent humanitarian crises , and that political efforts were required to promote respect for human rights , the rule of law and responsible management of public affairs .  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
The social and economic consequences of these conflicts have no parallel in contemporary history , but we can not simply pretend that military imposition , coercion and sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve the numerous humanitarian problems of the world .  
The existence of landmines and other undetonated explosive devices in various regions of the world is a tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the security , health and survival of the local population where these deadly devices have been scattered .  These devices prevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and impede humanitarian operations and programmes , national reconstruction and economic development activities and peacekeeping operations .  
While drawing the international community 's attention to the irrelevant linkage between the implementation of the aforementioned resolution and recent events in northern Iraq , and to the humanitarian appeals inside the country , we call on Iraq to cooperate fully with the United Nations in a manner that guarantees the effective and swift implementation of this resolution .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
The Blue Helmets have been joined by civil experts who provide political , economic , social and humanitarian assistance , thus contributing to the stabilization of situations and conflicts as well as to the search for a political settlement to conflicts through national reconciliation whenever necessary .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
The main purposes of the United Nations , as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter , include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends .  
This development has led us to supplement traditional peacekeeping instruments and to implement a policy that incorporates political , economic , social and humanitarian components within the framework of what is now known as preventive diplomacy and which the Secretary-General has quite rightly baptized as preventive action .  
We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transition between peace-keeping operations and the work of reconstruction aimed at reversing the economic , political and social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effective humanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of the populations affected .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
Turbay ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : As stated in the draft resolution before us today , the United Nations must be the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends such as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Effective and practical solutions must be found for the serious economic , social and humanitarian problems facing African States , which have been compounded by tragedies such as civil war , the spread of epidemics and deadly diseases , desertification , refugee problems and all they entail .  
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
The work of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) and other programmes and agencies in key social , economic and humanitarian initiatives outlined in the report are all of vital importance to efforts to improve the quality of life on the continent .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Recalling the paramount importance of the bilateral talks mediated by some powers with legitimate interests in facilitating a comprehensive solution to the situation in the Middle East , the Brazilian delegation also pays tribute to the indisputable role the United Nations has been playing over the years in this field , not only by means of peacekeeping , but also through economic , social and humanitarian assistance .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .  
The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former sectors North and South in the Republic of Croatia , as described in the report of the Secretary-General , including killings of several hundreds of civilians , systematic and widespread looting and arson and other forms of destruction of property .  The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .  
As we express our concern today at the humanitarian situation and at the situation of refugees , we echo the concern expressed by the Government of Georgia last September during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , when it warned that the harsh conditions endured by more than 300,000 displaced persons scattered throughout the territory of Abkhazia apart from constituting a heavy burden upon the entire country are a factor for instability that blocks the consolidation of the peace process . 
The promotion of the social , civil , political and economic rights of the Palestinian people could be guaranteed only by strict observance of the international human rights instruments and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , particularly as set forth in the fourth Geneva Convention .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
In his report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the Secretary-General had stated that the lives of millions of Iraqis were threatened by hunger , which had not deterred the Power that currently dominated the world from deliberately ignoring the humanitarian and legal aspects of such threats or from using the pretext of human rights to serve its political purposes and seeking to overthrow the current legitimate Government of Iraq .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
However , the Special Rapporteur indulged in an abstract political and legal analysis based on presumptions , allegations and misinformation with a view to emptying those decrees of their noble humanitarian content , seeking ways to exaggerate any shortcoming or weakness , presumed or real , in order to undermine the position of Iraq , thereby rendering his conclusions untrustworthy .  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
In its report to me , the team concluded that , in the current context of violence and instability , United Nations guards would not be able to guarantee the security of humanitarian personnel in Burundi ; indeed , in the present environment , the guards could themselves become potential targets for extremist groups , thus intensifying the security problems already faced by the international humanitarian effort .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
In general , desk officers and military mission officers deal with day-to-day operational and related political issues that affect the mandate and conduct of operations , as well as a broad range of other issues , which include military , logistical , administrative , humanitarian , electoral and legal issues .  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
We stress , however , that while UNMIH , with the generous support of the international community , has made a profound contribution to easing the harsh humanitarian conditions in Haiti and assisting in building its institutions , the ultimate responsibility for achieving lasting national reconciliation and reconstruction resides with the people of Haiti .  
Also urges all the Afghan parties to respect accepted humanitarian rules and all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
As we have indicated , three of them are out of service for lack of essential spare parts , which are supposed to be exempt from the provisions of resolution 748 ( 1992 ) for humanitarian reasons , and because of their advanced age and constant need of maintenance . inclement weather .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
Under the general supervision of the Registrar , assisted by the Deputy Registrar ( D-1 ) , the service would include six legal officers responsible for : court management and judicial administration ( 1 P-5 ) ; international humanitarian law , criminal law and coordinating the work of legal clerks assisting the Chambers , and general administrative legal issues ( 3-P-4 ) ; and judicial administration in the implementation of directives on the assignment of defence counsel and legal research including in the area of witness protection ( 2 P-3 ) .  
Recalling also additional Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Also gravely concerned at reports , including by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , of grave violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights in and around Srebrenica , and in the areas of Banja Luka and Sanski Most , including reports of mass murder , unlawful detention and forced labour , rape and deportation of civilians ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
Condemns the attacks on the safe areas of Srebrenica and _ epa by Bosnian Serb forces , which led to gross abuses of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law and the disappearance of thousands of persons , as detailed in the reports of the former and the current Special Rapporteurs ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Concerned about continuing indiscriminate and deliberate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers ,  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , according to which genocide and systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
The course covers the protection of the human rights of women in all pertinent areas , encompassing civil , political , economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues of humanitarian law .  
This gratitude also springs from the immense humanitarian efforts of the United Nations to bury the dead , care for the wounded , give shelter to families left with nothing and assist columns of desperate refugees fleeing aimlessly , hopelessly , driven forward by a war that follows on their heels , by a war that persecutes them in order to destroy them . 
The two sides consider that in preserving the main responsibility of the Security Council of safeguarding world peace and security , and in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter , efforts should be made to promote cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in preventing and mediating peacefully disputes and conflicts , and to promote more constructive and healthy coordination between the non-governmental organizations engaged in economic and social development , humanitarian assistance and other areas , and the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the above areas .  
The mission further recommended that Member States should be encouraged to support intensive and sustained efforts to develop a broad-based and independent media in Burundi as an essential complement to diplomatic , humanitarian , human rights and development efforts already under way .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Such steps included : lifting the blockade on the Palestinian territories ; refraining from violating the terms of the bilateral agreements including the imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law ; redeploying Israeli forces from Hebron ; establishing a corridor between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which would ensure contacts between the Palestinian territories ; releasing all Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons ; and pressing forward with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Area B on the West Bank .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
The course covers human rights protection of women in all pertinent areas , thus encompassing civil and political and economic and social rights , as well as relevant issues relating to humanitarian law .  
We declare that we shall support any steps undertaken by leaders at all levels , politicians , and representatives of parties , movements and diverse religious denominations with a view to strengthening international accord and peace in the Caucasus by increasing cultural , scientific , humanitarian and other contacts and promoting the ideas of democracy and social progress .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The humanitarian community will have to consider how it will relate in the future to global economic and social adjustments , to environmental and ecological concerns , and to human rights .  
In paragraph 2 ( b ) of its resolution 1995 / 56 , the Economic and Social Council urged the governing bodies of relevant organizations of the United Nations system to review , during the period from 1995 to 1997 , issues concerning the role and operational responsibilities , as well as the operative and financial capacities , of their respective organizations to respond , within their mandates , in the context of broad and comprehensive humanitarian programmes .  
The identification of the multiple actors ( United Nations , bilaterals , multilaterals , donors , non-governmental organizations , government authorities , beneficiaries , etc . ) and multiple levels ( international , regional , national , local ) engaged in humanitarian assistance response and the appropriate coordination mechanisms for these complex interactions will be addressed .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue . 
At the same time , the ministers reaffirmed the important need for continued and intensified international support , especially for efforts to halt the proliferation of weapons in Central Africa , to diffuse potentially catastrophic situations and to meet the critical humanitarian needs of millions of refugees and displaced persons in the area .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
The past year has seen the Tribunal take positive strides forward , tempered by the uneven cooperation which it has received from States and Entities of the former Yugoslavia and which , by the same token , tempers progress towards a new era of international implementation of humanitarian law .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
Iraq also submitted several requests to the Committee with regard to the partial release of its frozen assets for various purposes , such as paying its dues to international organizations , including the United Nations , financing the publication of the Holy Koran in Iraq , covering the cost of its pilgrimage programmes , meeting legal expenses for court actions outside the country , maintaining Iraq 's diplomatic missions abroad and purchasing humanitarian and other supplies from other countries .  
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,  
It further invited Governments to consider the development of standard minimum rules for the humanitarian treatment of trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards , and to support comprehensive practical approaches by the international community to assist women and children victims of transnational trafficking to return home and be reintegrated into their home societies .  
In the face of this paralysing economic strangulation , decreed unilaterally by our neighbours , which should be cultivating natural human solidarity more than ever with a Burundi immersed in a state of distress , we are once again threatened with genocide , the causes of which everyone is seeking to eradicate , but which could re-emerge owing to those measures that run counter to legal and humanitarian principles .  
These include the unbanning of all political parties , the restoration of the National Assembly , the initiation of businesslike and unconditional negotiations between all political and military powers in the context of the mediation efforts pursued by former President Nyerere , guarantees for the security and safety of members of the former Government , the immediate cessation of all acts of violence , ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the targeted needy groups throughout Burundi and ensuring the safety and security of personnel of regional and international humanitarian agencies .  
We need to ensure the proper observance of humanitarian standards for sanctions in order to minimize their detrimental effect on the already grievous situation of the broad segments of the Burundian population that have been worn down by a protracted and bloody conflict .  
Throughout the country , inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government are major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance and thus slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of tragedy in other areas .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
Regarding the proposed United Nations humanitarian programme for Somalia , the United Nations agencies at the country level have embarked on an inter-agency analytical and consultative process with a view to defining and reaching consensus on the role of the United Nations in the country over the medium-term , reflecting a common system-wide vision and outlining a set of broad objectives and strategies .  
Although a return to acute humanitarian crisis has been averted , political instability and the ensuing insecurity have prevented the country as a whole from moving into a straightforward reconstruction mode and , under current conditions , possibilities for medium - or long-term economic and social development are limited .  
The need for close coordination and collaboration among humanitarian partners in Somalia has intensified over the past year in view of continued insecurity and instability , the absence of effective national counterparts , limited donor resources and the precarious humanitarian situation .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
Article 17 includes in the crime of genocide the imposition of measures intended to prevent birth within the group ; article 18 includes provisions that rape , enforced prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse constitute prohibited acts under this article ; and article 20 prohibits outrages upon personal dignity in violation of international humanitarian law , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment , rape , enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault .  
These include the protection and security of relief personnel and convoys ; clearance of OLS flights into southern Sudan ; the extension of the March 1994 and May 1994 IGAD agreements on OLS humanitarian assistance into areas of cooperation left unaddressed by those agreements , such as modalities for the delivery of relief supplies involving cross-line convoys and access to conflict-affected areas , as well as the modalities for monitoring compliance with the relative principles and procedures ; operational procedures for international non-governmental organizations based in Khartoum .  
In recent experience , some peacekeeping operations have been mandated to include different combinations of the following tasks : monitoring of cease-fires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , demining , establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
The High Commissioner 's participation in the sixth extraordinary session of the Islamic Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina and her subsequent visit to OIC headquarters at Jeddah constituted a step forward in the two organizations ' common search for humanitarian solutions to the increasingly complex refugee situation in the OIC member States . 
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
Considering the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations calling , inter alia , for the promotion of international cooperation in solving problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms ,  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
However , it would be unfair to put the rebel groups , no matter what their role in the violence has been , on the same footing as a State which has ratified the major international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law and is therefore bound by strict obligations . 
While rebels or armed gangs are not similarly bound by these obligations , they nevertheless are required to respect certain humanitarian principles arising from international customary law and recognized by all civilized nations .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
Funding of humanitarian projects ; ( ii ) capacity-building ; ( iii ) internal and external training programmes ; ( iv ) creation of a conducive atmosphere for cooperation with international NGOs and United Nations agencies .  
To give free and unimpeded access to international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers to all areas where enforced or involuntary disappearances or cases of slavery , slave trade and similar institutions and practices , especially the sale of and trafficking in children and women have been reported ;  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
While civil servants in organs working directly with the humanitarian community are familiar with the respective roles played by the organizations , senior government officials told the Representative that apart from a few major agencies , other organizations and their activities were unknown to them . 
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
A realistic beginning could be to address a few selected humanitarian issues which , in recent years , have caused deep concern to Governments and unnecessary suffering to millions of people that could be mitigated or avoided if the world community were to ensure the observance of a set of basic rules of conduct . 
Distinct from the framework of fundamental human rights and freedoms , such an approach would concentrate on practical humanitarian problems whose continuing growth needs to be vigorously discouraged through solidarity with the victims as much as the human suffering they entail needs to be alleviated .  
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
Three critical factors would allow UNHCR to fulfil its role in ever more complex environments : respect must be ensured for its unique mandate of refugee protection ; a collective commitment to respond to emergencies and resolve humanitarian crises was essential ; and it was vital that UNHCR was fully equipped to carry out its mission .  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Kenya has had a long and productive association with the AALCC , and it is therefore with pleasure that I address the Assembly on behalf of the Kenya delegation to express our warm thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and secretariat of the AALCC for their outstanding work in promoting interregional and international cooperation , supportive of the efforts of the United Nations , with a view to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the progressive development and codification of international law as well as in economic and humanitarian matters .  
Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , paying tribute to those staff members who have endangered or lost their lives in the course of their duties , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations ,  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Recalling that the purposes of the United Nations are , inter alia , to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends ,  
The fourth preambular paragraph should read " Commending the High Commissioner and her staff for the competent , courageous and dedicated manner in which they discharge their responsibilities , " and a new fifth preambular paragraph should be inserted , to read : " Paying tribute to those staff members who had endangered or lost their lives , and emphasizing the urgent need for effective measures to ensure the security of staff engaged in humanitarian operations , " .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
New , often very complex tasks in insecure living / working environments , especially for staff employed by humanitarian agencies , and mobility in both function and location are the main features of the current work of the international civil service .  
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .  
We appeal to the parties concerned to cease immediately all hostile actions , ensure the safety of the lives and property of refugees and innocent civilians and guarantee the smooth delivery out of international humanitarian assistance so as to create conditions for the voluntary and orderly repatriation of the refugees and lay the foundation for a political settlement in the Great Lakes region .  
My delegation highly appreciates the valiant and expeditious efforts of the Canadian Government in taking the lead and ensuring broad participation by the international community in the formation of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and the voluntary , orderly and safe repatriation of refugees .  
I refer here to the need to play a more effective role at the international level which means sending a multinational force and ensuring the flow of necessary humanitarian aid to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees on the basis of full respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and to the need for a broad African participation in any multinational force .  
The multidimensional , intra-State nature of conflicts required that United Nations peacekeeping operations should be equipped with the skills to tackle a variety of military , political , humanitarian and civilian problems .  
Since its address to the Sixth Committee at the previous session , ICRC had continued its work to clarify the content of international humanitarian law and to ensure its continued adaptation to the conditions of modern warfare , with particular emphasis on its applicability to United Nations peacekeeping and enforcement operations , on rules applicable to war at sea , and on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and blinding laser weapons .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls on members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine as a matter of priority options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
The protection and humanitarian assistance provided to the child in the enjoyment of his or her rights set forth in the Convention , as well as in other relevant international instruments , including civil rights and freedoms and economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Please provide information on the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , including of a legislative , administrative and educational nature , to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to the State in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .  
In recent years , the total number of such personnel has increased very significantly and activities performed by them have expanded to backstopping of peacekeeping operations , disarmament and humanitarian assistance , and to areas which have , in the past , been carried out exclusively by staff members , such as economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
In resolution 47 / 168 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to examine all possible ways and means to provide adequate qualified personnel and administrative resources to the Department of Humanitarian Affairs from within existing resources of the regular budget of the United Nations and , where appropriate , through the secondment of national humanitarian disaster relief experts .  
In response to invitations by the General Assembly , and its request that the Secretary-General approach Governments for voluntary contributions in cash or in kind , individual Governments have contributed the services of personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .

Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .

Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
Welcomes the statement by the Government of the Sudan , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , [ 10 ] in which it pledged its logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery , and , accordingly , calls upon the Government to grant international human rights and humanitarian organizations and independent observers free and unimpeded access to all areas where these violations have been reported ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;

In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,

The following changes had been made to the text : the fifth preambular paragraph stressed the need for consolidating the existing bodies of international humanitarian law and the need for wide dissemination and full implementation of such law at the international level ; the wording of paragraph 4 had been brought into line with that of the fifth preambular paragraph ; and , in paragraph 5 , the reference to " preventive measures " in the earlier text had been deleted .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali local and regional counterparts and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
" Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;

Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
The Centre will develop a detailed Mine Action Plan to set up an information management system to support data collection , analysis and distribution , in order to provide the data for adequate mine-awareness training and planning of eventual humanitarian mine clearance , and to coordinate , support and develop mine-awareness training of the population , including in UTO-controlled areas , of relevant governmental bodies , UNMOT , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
Security Council resolution 1080 ( 1996 ) established a two-part mandate for the multinational force : facilitating the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organizations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire ; and facilitating the voluntary , orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons .

Noting the seriousness of the alarming effects of economic sanctions on humanitarian operations and assistance intended to provide relief to the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Panama recognizes and respects international humanitarian law and shares the will of States to establish mechanisms designed to promote and strengthen the rights of the child , in this case focusing on children who , voluntarily or not , are involved in acts of war and become the obvious victims or silent witnesses of such events , which have pervasive effects on their physical , social and family lives .

This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,

Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
Supporting fully the efforts of the International Tribunal aimed at the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 , and demanding that States and parties to the Peace Agreement meet their obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunal , as required by Security Council resolutions 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 and 1022 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , including with respect to surrendering persons sought by the Tribunal ,  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .

Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
If this influence is to be constructive and effective , the media must focus not only on the drama of conflict and confrontation in certain areas of the world , but on the global pattern of violence and the broader economic , social , political and humanitarian issues that dominate the international community 's long-term agenda .  
In the same way , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Rwanda stated ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 7 ) that the genocide of the Tutsis , the massacres of moderate Hutus and the renewed fighting in the civil war which followed were marked by many grave violations of international humanitarian law .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
In its representation , Latvia pointed to its over-assessment , dating back to 1991 , the current economic situation of the country , with falling real gross domestic product and a recent banking crisis , and severe restrictions on the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , given other pressing humanitarian and social needs .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR , both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
The cooperation between UNHCR and SADC will focus , inter alia , on the social , economic and political issues in the southern African region that have a bearing on the root causes of forced population displacement , refugee protection , provision of humanitarian assistance and the search for durable solution .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
In an exciting new development , the International Federation , non-governmental organizations , church agencies and the ICRC which between them are the end-point deliverers of some 95 per cent of international humanitarian assistance have come together to develop a second-generation code which will lay down minimal performance criteria for independent agencies and will define , for the first time , both a universal best practice for agencies and the quantity and quality of assistance disaster victims have a right to expect from assistance agencies . 
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
At the threshold of the third millennium , it is unacceptable that poverty and pollution still dominate the daily lives of billions of people all over the world ; it is unacceptable that hostilities and hatred still create deadly new conflicts and humanitarian disasters , between and within States on all continents ; and it is unacceptable that basic human and individual rights are still widely violated through injustice by Governments and the negligence of the international community .  
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .  It reaffirms the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
We are concerned at the constant threat to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States coming from Afghanistan ; the flow of narcotics and contraband weapons ; reports that reach us about gross violations of humanitarian law by the warring factions , including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war ; the blockade by the Taliban of the central regions of Afghanistan populated by the Hazara people , and the continuing large-scale violations of human rights , particularly the rights of women and children .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
This is the response of the international community aimed at achieving a complete ban on these treacherous and barbarous weapons , which are contrary to international humanitarian law , so that future generations will be free from the suffering of today \ x { e5b8 } civilian victims , in particular children .  
The treaty represents a solid international humanitarian commitment to alleviate the cruel and indiscriminate suffering caused by mines which have been placed throughout the world , affecting innocent civilian populations , and also to provide assistance to facilitate their rehabilitation and their social reintegration .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
In implementing the Guidelines , it should be borne in mind that achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , is one of the principal objectives of the United Nations .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
It will also include continuing financial contributions to the international community 's variegated activities in the humanitarian and economic and social fields , without which it will not be possible to restore lasting peace and security in the region .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
The Sudan urges the institutions entrusted with ensuring respect for international humanitarian law to institute an inquiry into the savage crimes committed by the Ethiopian Tigray forces against the innocent Sudanese prisoners and detainees in their possession , which have included physical liquidation , so that the perpetrators and war criminals implicated in these practices will not escape the justice of the law .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that rebels , Tutsi militias or Tutsi groups from the displaced persons ' camps accompanying the military , are all equally guilty of murderous acts that result in grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights .  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law , including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights , were committed in Rwanda ,  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations , and that the international community must exert every effort , in cooperation with national and international tribunals , to bring those responsible to justice , in accordance with international principles of due process ;  
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Alarmed by the marked increase in acts of sexual violence directed notably against women and children , as expressed in the Final Declaration of the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims , held in Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993 , and reiterating that such acts constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
While the United Nations has been successful in its humanitarian intervention , it has been less successful with the establishment of local political and social institutions capable of taking over for the State institutions destroyed in the civil war .  
When the Organization had assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it had also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal which was to bring to justice those individuals responsible for genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
On anti _ personnel landmines , we have heard a rather dramatic reference made in the statement of the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal and the representative of Kenya to the importance of the issue in some regions , and the importance of rapid and effective humanitarian action , but also I think that the significant reflection of these and other statements is that the issue is an issue of importance for the Conference on Disarmament and that we await a pronouncement in this regard .  
Thirdly , even allowing , though not conceding , that issues of international humanitarian law should be negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament , our methods of work do not guarantee that we will attain the aim of totally abolishing anti _ personnel landmines with the speed required by international public opinion because more than 25,000 innocent people are falling victim to these indiscriminate weapons each year . 
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
While the international law of human rights is , indeed , addressed to the behaviour of States and deals with acts or omissions of government officials 18 / or their agents , modern developments of international humanitarian law , 19 / recent authoritative pronouncements such as indicated in the introductory section of this working paper , 20 / and a respectable body of theory 21 / tend to embrace elements leading to some modification of the traditional position that private individuals or groups are not capable of violating human rights .  
Apart from this lacuna in humanitarian law ( which can be remedied by the application of the doctrine of state responsibility with regard to breaches of jus cogens rules ) , it is apparent that assertive international diplomatic measures are required to ensure that territorial settlements which prohibit forcible transfers of population and the implantation of settlers are respected by the parties to the agreements .  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 8 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 633 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Reed Brody ( United States of America ) as the third member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
Since 1990 , however , a number of major international and humanitarian crises , a global economic downturn , and domestic preoccupations and budgetary pressures in a number of the donor countries have dominated aid policies .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The General Assembly is encouraged to direct all of its committees and bodies and draw the attention of other bodies of the United Nations system to the need to mainstream a gender perspective systematically into all areas of their work , in particular in areas such as macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters ( para .  12 ) .  
By means of resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 28 March , the Council authorized a number of Member States to establish a multinational protection force of a temporary and limited nature to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
We believe that the Albanian operation has set a significant precedent for potential future interventions by the international community in cases where a State is gripped by a complex crisis with serious humanitarian implications and political repercussions for its neighbours .  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The Committee could not approve a request dated 24 September 1996 from Jordan for the Committee 's authorization of one or more regular weekly flights between Amman and Baghdad by Royal Jordanian Airlines in order to carry United Nations personnel and for humanitarian reasons , that is , to transport the sick and elderly to and from Baghdad , to provide means of transportation for pilgrims in their pilgrimage to Moslem shrines in Iraq , and to transport medical , pharmaceutical and food supplies from Jordan .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .  
The responsibility for preventing involuntary displacement fell to the international community , which must also provide humanitarian and financial assistance to the affected countries , bearing in mind that such measures should be part of a comprehensive strategy to promote peace , security and economic and social development in the countries concerned .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
The Organization of African Unity has consistently expressed its concern over the continued sanctions imposed on that country , with their humanitarian consequences on the ordinary people , and has called for a fair trial of the suspects according to acceptable requirements of justice and international law .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
A considerable contribution to strengthening security in the Mediterranean could be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has accumulated sound experience in drawing up and implementing joint steps by participating countries to strengthen security and cooperation in the military-political , economic , humanitarian and other spheres that could also be drawn on for resolving Mediterranean problems .  
Through the daily briefings given by the Spokesman and the increasing number of one-on-one contacts with journalists , the Office provides authoritative and timely information on the daily activities of the Secretary-General , as well as on peacekeeping operations , peacemaking , humanitarian assistance and a wide range of economic and social issues .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations , based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
Given the tremendous scale and severity of the violations of human rights and humanitarian law that were perpetrated during the traumatic days of the Rwandan civil war in 1994 - a time which saw the brutal carrying out of one of this century 's worst genocides - and the weak response of the international community at this critical time in Rwanda 's history , the Government is to be commended for its cooperation with the members of the international community active in human rights matters in Rwanda .  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
As documented in the present report and in previous reports , these restrictions relate primarily to access by Operation Lifeline Sudan to needy populations , whether in the form of relief flights from the base at Lokichokio into southern Sudan , humanitarian action in favour of the over 2-million internally displaced persons living in and around greater Khartoum , or permission to assess the conditions of civilian populations in the Nuba Mountains or in new areas of need created as a result of a resurgence of hostilities .  
In its resolution 51 / 30 G of 13 December 1996 , on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia , the General Assembly noted with concern that political instability and the absence of central authority continued to characterize Somalia and that , while the environment had become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , in others the humanitarian and security situation had worsened .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
In order to develop a shared understanding of the problems and possible solutions , preparations for the formulation of the strategic framework include a comprehensive needs assessment on the impact of the humanitarian tragedy as well as the constraints imposed on the economic , social and developmental prospects for recovery .  
Insecurity in the northern and western regions of Rwanda , where numerous vulnerable populations are located , reduced the access of humanitarian workers to the areas , with accompanying reductions in the reach and scope of humanitarian programmes .  
In an indicative list , the Council identified macroeconomic questions , operational activities for development , poverty eradication , human rights , humanitarian assistance , budgeting , disarmament , peace and security , and legal and political matters as areas where gender mainstreaming needs to be pursued systematically .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
Reaffirming its objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to achieve international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
The strategic framework for Afghanistan proposes a more holistic approach by the international community , whereby the political efforts of the United Nations inform , and are informed by , the international community 's social , economic and humanitarian priorities .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The international community has come to realize that only an integrated and holistic response to the issue of landmine contamination , and its multifaceted humanitarian and socio-economic consequences , is capable of bringing real and lasting benefits to those who are considered at risk from those weapons .  
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
A more precise global assessment of the mine problem is needed , based on the most inclusive possible range of factors , including the political , humanitarian , developmental , economic and security-related .  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as another voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Hence , should the right to reparation be limited to gross violations , the correct wording under public international law would be : gross violations of human rights and grave breaches and other serious violations of international humanitarian law .  
My delegation would like once again to reaffirm its profound wish to support any international initiatives that could genuinely help to find more effective solutions to the humanitarian problems stemming from the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of mines which at the same time protect the legitimate national security interests of States making use of such weapons for strictly defensive purposes and in compliance with all international provisions that apply to such weapons .  
Lastly , we would like to place on record that we joined in the consensus on this resolution on the understanding that any negotiating exercise that may take place in the immediate future must ensure that a requisite and necessary balance be struck between humanitarian concerns and the legitimate security interests of the States concerned .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
During the next 12 months , we have to cope with a vast agenda covering a broad range of political , economic , social , disarmament and humanitarian issues , as well as legal , administrative and budgetary ones .  
While remaining faithful to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security , cooperation for economic , social and cultural development , defence of human rights , and humanitarian assistance the United Nations should also promote and pursue a reform process which takes into account the many changes that have taken place in a complex international scene .  
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Among its primary purposes , the Charter of the United Nations provides for the maintenance of international peace and security ; the fostering between nations of international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples ; international cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields ; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all .  
And we all have an obligation to work towards maintaining international peace and security ; achieving international cooperation in solving economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems ; and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These reform proposals as a whole represent a timely and welcome initiative , given the fact that in today 's world the need has progressively increased for global common action on a number of pressing problems , such as the eradication of poverty , humanitarian emergencies , refugee problems , climate change and desertification , diminishing official development assistance funding , drugs , nuclear disarmament , the implementation of Agenda 21 , democracy and the maintenance of peace and security in various regions of the world .  
The mission , in its broadest sense , must coordinate and implement humanitarian relief , civil affairs , electoral assistance , police and judicial reorganization , human rights and economic and social reconstruction actions that must be sustained long after the guns have been silenced .  
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
The reform proposed by the Secretary-General is aimed at strengthening the leadership role of the Secretary-General , improving coordination among the various bodies active in each field , such as peace and security , economic and social affairs , development , human rights and humanitarian affairs , and ensuring greater cooperation among the different departments and programmes , in order to achieve a fully integrated and interactive United Nations .  
Crises require a coherent and effective international response , a response that should integrate preventive diplomacy , political mediation and humanitarian relief , but also social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication . 
At the close of the Review Conference , the European Union pledged to continue to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines and to strive towards the goal of their eventual elimination as stated in resolution 50 / 70 O . The Union firmly believes that the international community at every level must intensify its efforts towards eliminating the causes of this international humanitarian disaster as well as getting to grips with its horrific effects . 
This situation calls for urgent legal and humanitarian measures to establish a comprehensive global legal system banning all kinds of anti-personnel mines and to allay the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians by the mines , which impede the social and economic activities of these peoples .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
As in previous years , the responses indicated that the major causal factors of mass exoduses are international and internal conflicts , as well as systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
In an open challenge to every provision of international humanitarian law , in pursuance of an exclusive military option and by acquiring a large quantity of weapons and logistical support from abroad , the Taliban mercenaries attacked and occupied part of Charikar , the capital of the province of Parwan to the north of Kabul on 16 January 1997 .  
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Encourages Governments to ensure coherence in the direction given to the governing bodies of relevant organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system , and to thereby promote the development and strengthening of the cooperation between these organizations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , drawing on the mandate , expertise and respective strengths and available capabilities of each , to improve the system-wide capability for a quick and coordinated response to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and also requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
Reaffirms that the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the primary mechanism for inter-agency decisions on system-wide policy issues relating to humanitarian assistance , for formulating a coherent and timely response to major disasters and complex emergencies and for inter-agency decisions of an operational nature , and calls upon members of the Standing Committee to continue to examine , as a matter of priority , options and proposals to improve its functioning ;  
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
At a time when the basic feature of international relations is the increasing interdependence of the players in the areas of security , economic and social relations , humanitarian and other affairs , multilateral diplomacy , including international organizations , has an important role to play in the solution of all major problems our world is faced with . 
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
During the Representatives visit to Mozambique , it was emphasized that given the magnitude of the crisis and the very different situations in which the displaced found themselves , a comprehensive , flexible and multisectoral approach was required to address the diversity of needs faced by the displaced and that this task could best be accomplished by collaborative arrangements among the various humanitarian actors .  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties fully to respect accepted humanitarian rules and act in accordance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the rights of women and children , and calls upon the Afghan authorities to take measures to ensure the effective participation of women in social , political and cultural life throughout the country ;  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
More recently , with the rapid growth of mandated activities , the Secretary-General had been able to turn to Member States to provide gratis personnel to support activities in peacekeeping , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , international tribunals , economic and social research , internal oversight services , administration and management .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
The force would perform such duties as accompanying humanitarian convoys , protecting international humanitarian personnel , protecting some key ports or airports where humanitarian goods are expected to enter Albania , guarding depots and other places where humanitarian goods are kept , and securing safe corridors for humanitarian convoys on parts of national roads .  
The President of the Republic , the Prime Minister and all the political parties addressed a formal request to the Western European Union , for a group of countries to assist in restoring and maintaining law and order , resolving the security situation , guaranteeing distribution of humanitarian aid , and protecting lines of communication , and for international community missions to start operating in the country through a multinational police protection force .  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
The integration of Azerbaijan and Georgia , which are an integral part of Europe , into the European institutions will create broad opportunities for resolving political , economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems on the basis of universally accepted European standards ;  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
Invites Governments to accord standard minimum humanitarian treatment to trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards and , with the support of the United Nations , to formulate manuals for the training of personnel who receive and / or hold in temporary custody victims of gender _ based violence , including trafficking , with a view to sensitizing them to the special needs of victims ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
On 28 March 1997 , the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , by which it authorized the establishment of a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate in a neutral and impartial way the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
Expresses its conviction of the importance of sound , inclusive development strategies to avoid conflict and dislocation , recognizes the value of international cooperation , peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts , and stresses the need for the international community to continue to assist those countries receiving refugees in coping with the resulting economic , social , humanitarian and environmental challenges ;  
Reaffirming its objectives as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Deeply concerned that intermittent drought , and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation , coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict , have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia , worsening the overall humanitarian situation ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aiming at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
There was no major humanitarian crisis in 1996 but daily life for the average Somali person continued to be very difficult , especially in the southern half of the country .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross and within existing resources , to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session an analytical report on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity , taking into consideration in particular the issues raised in the report of the International Workshop on Minimum Humanitarian Standards held in Cape Town , South Africa from 27 to 29 September 1996 , and identifying , inter alia , common rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law that are applicable in all circumstances ;  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
However , a number of security incidents have hindered humanitarian activities in the central and southern regions of the country , while difficulties continue to be experienced with the free circulation of people in the areas controlled by UNITA in the northern and eastern parts of Angola .  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of the United Nations peace _ keeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
By its resolution 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 , the Security Council decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 ( " International Tribunal " ) and adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General 's report prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) of 22 February 1993 .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Nevertheless , the conflict that engulfed eastern Zaire and the sudden and large-scale return of Rwandans from Zaire and the United Republic of Tanzania at the end of 1996 posed unprecedented challenges for UNHCR both in terms of providing humanitarian assistance in the midst of conflict and of supporting massive reintegration in a fragile post-conflict environment .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
The objectives will be met by providing support to the mechanisms for humanitarian coordination , emergency response and inter-agency collaboration at Headquarters and in the field through the Emergency Relief Coordinator , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the United Nations humanitarian or resident coordinators in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of people suffering from famine , displacement and human deprivation as a result of civil strife or other conflict-driven situations .  
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
While the situation within that country has stabilized to some degree , owing to the deployment of the multinational protection force and to the efforts of various humanitarian agencies , it is anticipated that the restoration of political , economic and social order will take some time , even after the election that is planned for late June .  
In the view of all the main parties concerned and qualified to judge the need for this tribunal , namely , the Government , legal political parties of all ideologies and allegiances , civil society , youth , humanitarian organizations , etc . , everything points to the need for this international judicial body to be set up by the United Nations Security Council .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
While the operation is financed from income accruing as a result of a limited exception to the sanctions regime , the resolution prescribes numerous safeguards to be implemented in order to ensure that the humanitarian assistance is not used for purposes other than those specifically authorized and that it benefits , in equal measure , the needy civilian population as a whole .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance . 
The meeting expressed , inter alia , appreciation for the neutral and impartial way in which the multinational protection force , acting under Security Council resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , carries out its mandate and for the positive results so far achieved in guaranteeing the safe arrival of humanitarian aid .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
While peacekeeping , civilian , humanitarian , economic , social , and political activities are all part of the integrated process of peace-building , special attention should be given to the observance of the norms and principles of international law , including international humanitarian law .  
In accordance with the Charter of the United Nations , the Organization aims at the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality of all its Members , equal rights and self - determination of peoples and at achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
Article 1 , paragraph 3 , stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
However , in complex or overtly political situations , such as Cambodia , southern Sudan , northern Iraq and the former Yugoslavia , special arrangements were put in place on a case _ by _ case basis , including the designation of a lead agency to coordinate the international humanitarian response .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
IASC has agreed that simple field-based monitoring systems should be established in all complex emergency situations in which the United Nations system is involved in order to facilitate accountability , to optimize utilization of resources , to avoid duplication of effort and to adapt to changing circumstances .  The establishment of the system will be an inter _ agency effort carried out under the leadership of the resident / humanitarian coordinator .  
Considering that the dedication of a year to the act of giving thanks gives us the opportunity to remember the fundamental importance of cultural diversity in the development of a rich and harmonious International life and that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as expressed in its Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems in economic , social , cultural and humanitarian areas without creating any distinctions for reasons of race , sex , language or religion ,  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .  
I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 1 August 1997 ( S / 1997 / 617 ) concerning your decision to appoint Mr . Atsu-Koffi Amega ( Togo ) and Mr . Andrew R . Chigovera ( Zimbabwe ) to be respectively the Chairman and a member of the investigative team to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 has been brought to the attention of the members of the Council .  
You have no doubt noted that , even after the submission of your report to the Security Council of 2 June 1997 ( S / 1997 / 419 ) , two of the members of the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , namely the United States and the United Kingdom , are continuing to raise numerous difficulties and obstacles to the proper implementation of the provisions of the memorandum of understanding by impeding the approval of contract applications for the purchase of food , medicines and other basic humanitarian requirements .  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Decides to authorize the inclusion of this question in the preliminary document concerning a study in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , to be submitted to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the Purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Guided by the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations , particularly Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter , which stipulates that one of the Purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion ,  
The General Assembly has recognized the importance of the collaboration of IOM in those activities by inviting it to participate on a regular basis in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , a group responsible for the formulation of system-wide humanitarian policy and for ensuring that complex emergencies are dealt with through an integrated strategic approach . 
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
On the contrary , the international community should provide a coherent and effective response , incorporating preventive diplomacy , political mediation , humanitarian relief , social action , economic alternatives and cultural communication .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
When the Organization assumed the responsibility of establishing the Tribunal , it also assumed the responsibility of ensuring that it was able to operate effectively , bearing in mind the purpose of the Tribunal , which is to bring to justice those individuals responsible for the genocide and other systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian laws committed in Rwanda and neighbouring States .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
Iraq has announced that it stands ready to act in accordance with international norms and with the principles elaborated in the context of the work of the Tripartite Commission , and it has remained open to all the initiatives put forward by States and organizations that are not members of the Commission with a view to finding a speedy and definitive solution to this humanitarian issue .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
We are distressed about this downward trend , characterized by the widespread loss of human life and a worsening pattern of grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
The fighting is again causing enormous suffering for the Afghan people and adds to their misery , while human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law continue to be violated with impunity .  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
The effective conduct of such operations required closer integration of political , military , humanitarian and economic actions , as well as collective security efforts at the global and regional levels .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The report should have contained a functional analysis of the backstopping requirements of peacekeeping operations as they relate to the implementation of their mandates ( military , civilian police , human rights monitoring , humanitarian , electoral assistance ) .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
Increased efforts of the Catholic Church and others , along with better understanding of the international humanitarian norms among senior military officers , improved the overall quality of human rights monitoring in East Timor .  
There is growing recognition of the essential linkages between all aspects of external support for countries afflicted by conflict , whether political , humanitarian , developmental or human rights .  
Have established competence in relevant areas of international law such as international humanitarian law and the law of human rights , and extensive experience in a professional legal capacity which is of relevance to the judicial work of the Court ;  
Have established competence in relevant areas of international law such as international humanitarian law and the law of human rights , and extensive experience in a professional legal capacity which is of relevance to the judicial work of the Court ;  
Twenty-one per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 22 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation which is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation that is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
In conformity with its humanitarian ideal , his Government considered that the human dimension , especially the social , economic and cultural rights of the people , should be taken into account whenever sanctions were imposed .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
Peacekeeping operations with a humanitarian component were increasingly coming to the fore , and raised a number of difficult political , legal and operational problems .  
It expressed its grave concern over the situation of anarchy prevailing in the Comorian Island of Anjouan and the humanitarian problems caused by the fighting which broke out between opposing factions within the separatist movement .  
It is intolerable for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law to be violated , that minimal protection is not provided to civilians and non-combatants and that people are forcibly displaced for ethnic or religious reasons .  
In the framework of the three main items on the agenda political , economic / trade and cultural / educational / humanitarian matters our Governments will make proposals based on the values and interests shared by both regions .  
The existence of common historical , political , economic and cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and development of relations through bilateral and multilateral cooperation .  
Although international humanitarian law , refugee law and human rights law are often treated as separate branches of international law , they all have a common goal of protecting individuals from harm and should therefore be considered as complementary .  
The consequences of the current repressive approach not only affect the immediate humanitarian situation , they also have a direct and major adverse impact on the prospects for a just and lasting political solution .  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The State and conflicting parties are required to adhere to the humanitarian imperative and facilitate safe and easy access to endangered populations and affected areas for rapid provision of humanitarian assistance ;  
If indeed there is a genuine desire to prevent humanitarian disaster or to avoid costly peacekeeping operations and peacemaking efforts , then comprehensive , concerted and concrete action on economic development cooperation must be taken .  
Because the extensive use and destructive power of landmines have become critical items on the international agenda , the Secretary-General decided the issue should be addressed in the dual context of peacekeeping and humanitarian operations .  
Twenty per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 16 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Both parties to the armed conflict have disregarded the rules of international humanitarian law , particularly the rebels , who display unusual cruelty which is reminiscent of the massacres committed during the so _ called war of liberation against the Hutu refugees and which the Special Rapporteur , the joint mission of the Commission on Human Rights and the Secretary _ General 's Investigative Team were prevented from investigating .  
The right to a remedy 23 / is indicated to require that : ( i ) each State ensure that adequate remedies are available to any person claiming a violation of rights and ensure their right of access to these remedies ; ( ii ) each legal system provide prompt and effective procedures to ensure readily accessible and adequate remedies , and protection from intimidation and retaliation ; and ( iii ) each State provide universal jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Calls upon Governments and other actors to ensure strict adherence to accepted humanitarian norms and principles and to promote national and international legislation that is responsive to actual and potential humanitarian problems ;  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
As a future venue and a focal point for the Mine Ban Convention and the various activities in the field of mine action that it will produce , Geneva would offer a wide variety of diplomatic and technical expertise , a broad representation of diplomatic missions and humanitarian agencies and relevant non _ governmental organizations , including ICRC , WHO , UNHCR and the newly established Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining .  
These two agreements and their follow _ up mechanisms provide a comprehensive response to the problems posed by anti _ personnel landmines , although the complete removal of the millions of mines scattered around the world will regrettably continue to be one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of the international community for the foreseeable future .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
There is thus a need for strengthened international cooperation with a view to enhancing the legal protection of vulnerable groups in internal conflict , to improve international monitoring and to promote an active role of the international community in protecting human rights and fundamental humanitarian standards in such situations .  
Of equal concern to the international community is the growing threat faced by humanitarian workers , who risk their personal safety for the noble purpose of alleviating suffering and hardship .  
Finally , the promotion of the security of civilians , including the personnel of humanitarian organizations , also depends on concrete , decisive and courageous measures designed to halt arms flows towards zones of instability and conflict , be they light and small-calibre weapons , more sophisticated and heavier weapons or anti-personnel mines .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The success of these programmes would not have been possible without the respect for international humanitarian law and the direct and indirect cooperation of the parties to the conflict , which in practice shared common areas of mutual respect , to the benefit of the civilian population and the national and international non-governmental humanitarian assistance organizations , particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
We were responsible for convening the first periodic meeting on international humanitarian law , which in January 1998 dealt with the protection of humanitarian personnel and so-called unstructured conflicts , and also the expert meeting on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which in October 1998 considered general problems relating to the implementation of the Convention in general and in occupied territories .  
Support to peacekeeping exercises focuses on the multidimensional and multinational aspects of this training and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations routinely provides not just military and civilian police role players and trainers , but also Special Representatives of the Secretary-General , political , legal and public information staff members and humanitarian , human rights and non-governmental organization coordinators .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
Underlines the importancethat relevant measures to ensure respect for the rights of the child in the areas of health and nutrition , formal , informal or non-formal education , physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration be included in emergency and other humanitarian assistance policies and programmes ;  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religious persuasion , association and movement and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national , regional and international levels , and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues , to the conduct of education , training and research in this field , and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
On behalf of the Ministry of Human Rights , I extend my sincere thanks to the national human rights organizations and eminent Congolese civilians who , at the risk of their lives , have provided the Ministry with information on serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the eastern provinces , thereby contributing to the preparation of this white paper .  
The table appended to this document is only a snapshot , giving no more than an indication , albeit a revealing one , of the blatant , deliberate and massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Rwandan , Ugandan and Burundian aggressors in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Against a background of violations of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law , the economic , social and cultural rights of the Congolese are being violated by looting , extortion and destruction of installations and property essential for the survival of the population .  65 .  Other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law deserve to be highlighted .  
The periodic humanitarian assistance in the form of food , clothing , footwear and medicines given by international and local charitable organizations , small enterprises and farms also plays an important role in aiding the needy , the elderly , the disabled , residential institutions and orphans .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and has primary responsibility for managing , directing and supporting all mandated peacekeeping operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices , preventive diplomacy , peacemaking and humanitarian missions , as required .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
We welcome the newly established international legally binding norm on an APLs ban as a pivotal step towards a sustainable response to the global humanitarian crisis caused by their indiscriminate use in various parts of the world .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
Conducted seminars on the law of the sea , University of Dar es Salaam ( 1976-1980 ) ; attended numerous seminars at national and international level on constitutional law , humanitarian and human rights law , international law .  
With regard to conduct forbidden by international humanitarian law , there were numerous cases of murders of protected persons , torture , taking of hostages , attacks on the civilian population and forced displacements , which followed a systematic pattern .  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
Since the most recent triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , coordination had greatly improved , the resident coordinator system had been strengthened and cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in such areas as humanitarian assistance , post-conflict peace-building and regional-level operations had increased .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
The overall situation at the end of 1998 was characterized by continuing armed conflict , the political crisis resulting from lack of agreement on the framework for durable peace , the continuing violations and denial of human rights and the deteriorating humanitarian situation , affected by the absence of international personnel of the United Nations agencies as well as others engaged in humanitarian work , and the reduction of resource flows .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
The primary objective of the unit will be to promote respect for human rights and compliance with minimum humanitarian standards , and to deter massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
These developments present an opportunity to adopt a bold and imaginative strategy which would enable the international community to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Afghanistan while firmly adhering to the commitment to establish a framework for durable peace based on a realization of the human rights of all Afghans .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
Mr . Nesho ( Albania ) : The moment that we are going through is a historic moment for the future of the Balkans , as the international community is intervening in order to stop the humanitarian catastrophe and the tragedy of a nation whose people have been tortured , killed and buried in common graves , a nation that is justly demanding its legitimate rights to freedom and to its very existence undeniable rights for all peoples .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
The archive should be organized by major substantive and support tasks , including monitoring ceasefires and buffer zones , protecting humanitarian convoys , disarming and demobilizing ex-combatants , reforming military establishments , defining and establishing police forces , organizing or monitoring elections , monitoring human rights , promoting electoral and judicial reform , promoting aspects of civil administration and coordinating economic rehabilitation .  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;  
At the impact of the current conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The use of such personnel had been expanded from the traditional area of technical cooperation to other sectors such as military planning , logistical support for peacekeeping operations , disarmament , humanitarian assistance , internal oversight , economic and social research and administration and management .  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
As reflected in the aforementioned resolutions , from the outset , the Security Council gave early recognition to the suffering of the Iraqi civilians under a very rigorous sanctions regime and , concerned with the serious nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi civilian population , laid down the foundation for establishing a humanitarian programme .  
Gravely concerned by such recent outrages as the murder of three human rights defenders and mass abduction from an aircraft , for which guerrilla groups were responsible , it calls on the guerrilla groups to respect norms of international humanitarian law , especially to refrain from killings and all attacks on the civilian population , indiscriminate massacres , hostage _ taking and the widespread use of anti _ personnel landmines , and to fulfil their own pledges not to recruit children .  
In fact , it is quite the contrary : the fate of the Kosovars has become entirely incidental , and the humanitarian banner is being used as a cover for NATO 's attempts to destroy the present world order , which is based on respect for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations . This , in fact , is the big picture , not the fact that one single person is responsible for all of this . 
We appeal to the members of NATO to think before it is too late and to immediately halt their military action which has already brought such untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people , created a humanitarian catastrophe and thrown Europe backwards into the distant past .  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
Mr . Qin Huasun ( China ) ( spoke in Chinese ) : China is deeply disturbed by the current humanitarian crisis in the Balkans and has profound sympathy for the over 700,000 Kosovar refugees who have been left homeless and separated from their loved ones .  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
Notwithstanding its own difficult economic situation , which , in fact , is complicated by economic losses caused by the ongoing military actions in Yugoslavia , Ukraine is contributing to international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo .  
In this connection , the Special Rapporteur received consistent information that the Government of the Sudan is providing arms and ammunition to paramilitary groups such as the Murahaleen which are commonly held responsible for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
He received well _ documented information , often from first-hand sources , pointing to the perpetration of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in southern Sudan , of which innocent civilians constitute the principle target and the famine is one of the direct by-products , in the context of which food is manipulated as a weapon of war .  
The religious leaders emphasized the peaceful co-existence of the two communities , but with the other two groups focused on the tragic events in January / February 1998 that set the stage in Bahr-el-Ghazal for the worst humanitarian crisis culminating in the deadliest famine since 1988 , when an estimated 250,000 people were killed , and in massive population displacement .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
Jordans policy targeted the humanitarian dimensions of the refugee problem and focused on satisfying the basic everyday needs of the refugees and on furthering their political and legal rights to return or compensation in accordance with the relevant resolutions .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
Following these informal consultations , the President made a statement to the media , on behalf of the members of the Council , expressing their concern at renewed fighting and their support for ECOWAS and other international efforts to bring peace ; calling upon all parties to halt military operations and allow the free flow of humanitarian assistance ; and urging all parties to renew their commitments to the Abuja peace process and to respect the ceasefire of 3 February .  
The members of the Council also expressed their support for renewed and urgent diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military , political , security and humanitarian fronts .  
The members of the Council expressed concern over the sporadic renewal of fighting , and called on all parties to halt military operations , respect international humanitarian law and facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .  
In its resolution 1997 / 36 , of 28 August 1997 , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities authorized Ms . Clemencia Forero Ucros to prepare a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering , for submission to the Sub _ Commission at its fiftieth session .  
Numerous international documents have been severely violated by the unprovoked and illegal NATO aggression : the Charter of the United Nations , the humanitarian law provisions , especially the Geneva Conventions with the related protocols , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , provisions of international agreement in the field of the environment , as well as the basic proclaimed principles of environmental protection .  
It is essential to fight for respect of human rights and norms of international humanitarian law , but solely through political and legal methods on the firm basis of the United Nations Charter and the relevant multilateral instruments .  
While Mexico shares the outrage of the international community over the abuses of basic human , family and community rights , it has stated that the use of force , even inspired by the most noble humanitarian cause , leads to more violence and is hardly conducive to a lasting solution to problems .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
In this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , the focus has been on three parallel approaches : promoting respect for existing international humanitarian law ; promoting the establishment of the International Criminal Court ; and engaging the Security Council in efforts to identify innovative ways in which the Council , acting within its mandate , can strengthen its capacity to ensure the protection of civilians in conflict .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
As a result of the compromise reached , Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations defines one of the Organization 's purposes as being to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion .  
Took note of the information provided by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on how to sign / ratify the Tampere Convention which provides a legal framework for the use of telecommunications in international humanitarian assistance ; ( i ) Noted that the considerable recent advances in seasonal weather and climate predictions , including of such phenomena as El Nio , enable improved preparedness of vulnerable communities against natural disasters .  
At its fiftieth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1998 / 112 , decided to continue consideration of the adverse consequences of economic sanctions on human rights at its fifty _ first session under the agenda sub _ item entitled Implications of humanitarian activities for the enjoyment of human rights .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
Despite the surfeit of pious excuses that has been found to justify ethically the launching of this overseas colonial enterprise , and the pseudo _ juridical ( sometimes even openly anti-juridical ) reasoning which has attempted to defend it legally , there is irrefutable evidence that its clearly _ defined goals had nothing either humanitarian or civilizing about them .  
Providing support to develop coherent field-based humanitarian strategies , credible and successful consolidated appeals , developing a strategic monitoring capacity that supports resource mobilization efforts of the Emergency Relief Coordinator and strengthens the United Nations system accountability in complex emergencies and leading this process and focusing on management of all aspects related to the consolidated appeals process cycle ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the document entitled " White paper on massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) and their Congolese accomplices in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo : Volume II " , covering the period from 6 November 1998 to 15 April 1999 ( see annex ) .  
In the first volume of the white paper , the Ministry of Human Rights concentrated on the massive violations of human rights and of the basic rules of international humanitarian law by the aggressor countries ( Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi ) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
As part of an effort to make both national and international public opinion aware of the massive violations of human rights , the basic rules of international humanitarian law and environmental protection standards , the Government of National Salvation , through the Ministry of Human Rights , has taken the initiative of issuing periodic publications which provide a summary account of the conduct of the aggressor States of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 which deal with international humanitarian law provides an opportunity for States which have signed and become party to the Conventions to reflect upon the degree of applicability of the provisions governing conduct of hostilities and respect for the civilian population , including vulnerable persons considered as non-combatants .  
The aggressor countries have committed clear violations under the terms of international law : acts of aggression , violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Organization of African Unity , violation of basic rules and principles of international humanitarian law , massive violations of fundamental individual rights and violations of provisions of international environmental law .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Given the limited nature of UNHCRs involvement in Colombia , it is recognized that UNHCRs support will only be effective if linked to broader efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and to strengthen respect for human rights , within the context of a common approach with other United Nations partners .  
Initiated in January 1998 , this process was broadened over the course of the last year to engage a wide range of non-state actors - - including major human rights and humanitarian NGOs , United Nations sister agencies and the corporate sector - - in a series of dialogues on the nature and dimensions of the current protection challenges ; where the main problems lie ; and what States and organizations might do together with UNHCR to ensure improved and sustained support for protection principles .  
They include the need for effective demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into productive civilian life ; post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation in stable and secure environments ; reform and capacity-building of police , judicial and penal systems ; and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law , including with regard to the use and transfer of small arms .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .  Over 45 NGOs , along with major bilateral donors , have committed personnel and resources to meet the immediate relief needs of the people of Kosovo .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .  
It had been urged that it was imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
The Council expresses its concern , in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions , about the continuous erosion , in many cases , in the respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and principles , both in terms of denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need and through deliberate violence against all those protected under international humanitarian law , especially women and children .  
This is attributable primarily to the determined efforts of my Special Representative , supported by the Russian Federation as facilitator , as well as the group of Friends of the Secretary-General , in insisting to the sides that continuation of the status quo is not an acceptable option , and in encouraging and logistically facilitating bilateral contacts in the fields of culture , humanitarian issues and economic cooperation , as well as on political questions .  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
Appeal to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture , if possible on a regular basis , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide ,  
The meeting assessed the cooperation between the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields as outlined in General Assembly resolution 53 / 8 .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .  
To appreciate fully the emphasis the Declaration puts on international cooperation , article 4 should be read in conjunction with the opening sentence of the preamble to the Declaration which refers to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural and humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .  
Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
The increasing number of complex emergencies and the involvement of the United Nations in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations have raised the interest not only of the traditional operational partners of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations , but also of research and academic institutions and universities .  This development deserves to be encouraged and fortified .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
According to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , international cooperation should be paramount in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
There can be no doubt that the atrocities committed against the civilian population of Sierra Leone , including widespread systematic killings , rapes and amputations , constitute massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 20 May 1996 confirmed the exceptional and temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme which was intended to provide for the most urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who were subjected to collective punishment through the most vile regime of comprehensive sanctions in history .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
All these initiatives have been carried out despite the climate of uncertainty prevailing throughout the country , characterized by potential and actual food shortages , a hard-to-reach population scattered throughout Katanga , and a volatile situation in Kasa hindering the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance ( scattered population , heavy military presence , etc . ) . 
General Blaki _ is charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity on the basis of his alleged responsibility as a superior in respect of the serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by members of the armed forces of the HVO against Bosnian Muslims in the area of central Bosnia during the period from May 1992 to January 1994 .  
With regard to the latter decision , the Trial Chamber stated that " [ international humanitarian law ] does not lay down synallagmatic obligations , i.e . obligations based on reciprocity , but obligations erga omnes ( or , in the case of treaty obligations , obligations erga omnes contractantes ) which are designed to safeguard fundamental human values and therefore must be complied with regardless of the conduct of the other party or parties . "  
In March 1998 , the Prosecutor proclaimed publicly that the territorial and temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal covered any serious violations of international humanitarian law taking place in Kosovo and stated that she was empowered to investigate such crimes .  
We can not but sound the alarm regarding information on new gross violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including reports of mass shootings , arrests and forcible relocations of hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants of Afghanistan .  
Pursuant to a recommendation contained in his report on the situation of internal displacement in Azerbaijan ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 79 / Add . 1 ) submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-fifth session after a mission to that country , a meeting was held in May 1999 with Government officials and representatives of the humanitarian , development and diplomatic communities with the aim of devising a common strategy to meet the immediate , medium - and long-term needs of the internally displaced . 
The cooperation between the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) and OIC , through its subsidiary organs and its specialized and affiliated institutions , was closely continued in the social , humanitarian and technical fields and in their bilateral search for solutions to global problems in the region .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
Article 8 : A key role in the promotion of a culture of peace belongs to parents , teachers , politicians , journalists , religious bodies and groups , intellectuals , those engaged in scientific , philosophical and creative and artistic activities , health and humanitarian workers , social workers , managers at various levels as well as to non-governmental organizations ;  
I do not want to conclude without paying my delegation 's special tribute to the entire staff men and women of UNAMET and all other humanitarian personnel , particularly those who still remain voluntarily and courageously in Dili , for their tireless efforts , devotion and sometimes sacrifices that they have so valiantly demonstrated in the face of an extremely difficult environment throughout the process , since the popular consultation up to now .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
As a representative of a State subjected to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster due to the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the aggression carried out daily by two permanent Council Members , I launch an appeal to the Council to abandon the double standard and to be true to the role assigned to it in the Charter .  
These are : insisting on the proposal to send an international security force ; adopting measures involving economic pressure on Indonesia at the multilateral and individual levels ; and providing , as quickly as possible , multifaceted , coordinated and duly protected international humanitarian assistance to the people .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
This is true both because of the increased demand that we do something when gross and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law occur , and also because the new international security environment makes it more feasible to do so .  
The United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone reported horrifying violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including the wilful killing and torture or inhuman treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities .  
IRIN updates and alerts , covering a wide range of humanitarian , human rights , political , economic and social issues , are drawn from an extensive network of United Nations and other sources , ranging from Governments , international organizations , academic institutions and think-tanks in capital cities to non-governmental organizations , religious missions and private enterprise .  
While the humanitarian operation achieved its overriding objective to ensure the security and meet the immediate life-sustaining needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees the multiplicity of actors , including bilateral actors , compounded the problems of providing a coherent , effective humanitarian response .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Emphasizing that cooperation in political , economic , environmental , humanitarian and security fields contributes to the common goal of a secure , stable and prosperous Baltic and Black Sea space as an integral part of an undivided Europe ;  
The first is the pledge of $ 220-million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Kosovo and neighbouring countries ; and the second is a pledge announced yesterday in Tokyo for a preliminary $ 2-million to meet immediate humanitarian needs for East Timor , to be followed by further assistance in response to any future appeal , as well as substantial financial contributions to the United Nations trust fund to support the multinational force established by the Security Council resolution . 
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
While we recognize the difficulty of achieving smart sanctions in the real world , we also believe that there is a continuing need to minimize collateral , unintended humanitarian suffering through the imposition of more specifically targeted sanctions and mechanisms for periodic substantive reviews .  
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
Recognizing the critical role played by many other United Nations and non-United Nations bodies and humanitarian agencies in protecting civilians in armed conflict and in providing them with humanitarian assistance and all necessary relief , we stand by our position that the Security Council should be the guiding and coordinating organ in these international efforts .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
The Netherlands calls for a coherent and integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution in which the diplomatic , political , military , economic and humanitarian aspects , as well as development assistance , are treated as integral parts .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
Calls on States which have not already done so to consider ratifying the major instruments of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law , and to take appropriate legislative , judicial and administrative measures to implement these instruments domestically , drawing on technical assistance , as appropriate , from relevant international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations bodies ;  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , and stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility ,  
Member States shall enhance the process of political consultations and develop cooperation based on mutual interests in the economic , social , humanitarian , environmental , information , scientific and cultural spheres , with each member State making its contribution under conditions of full equality .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;

My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
It is expected that , through this dialogue , innovative ideas will emerge regarding the specific goals that the United Nations should strive to achieve in the forthcoming decades , in particular in the five core areas of its work , namely , development cooperation , economic and social affairs , humanitarian affairs , peace and security , and human rights .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
A key role in the promotion of a culture of peace belongs to parents , teachers , politicians , journalists , religious bodies and groups , intellectuals , those engaged in scientific , philosophical and creative and artistic activities , health and humanitarian workers , social workers , managers at various levels as well as to non-governmental organizations .  
Being aware that international migration , particularly irregular migration , has increasingly become a major economic , social , humanitarian , political and security concern for a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region ;  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in West Timor : first , the Indonesian government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose - return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia - it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
The report of the second panel concerning the current humanitarian situation in Iraq ( S / 1999 / 356 , annex II ) , had referred to the qualitative dimension of the impact of the sanctions and to the cumulative effects of sustained deprivation on the psychosocial cohesion of the Iraqi population as indicated by an increase in juvenile delinquency , begging and prostitution , anxiety about the future and lack of motivation , and a rising sense of isolation .  
Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,  
Authorizes the establishment , for an initial period of six months until 15 April 2000 , of the United Nations Office in Angola ( UNOA ) staffed with the personnel necessary to liaise with the political , military , police and other civilian authorities , with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace , assisting the Angolan people in the area of capacity-building , humanitarian assistance , the promotion of human rights , and coordinating other activities ;

Mr . Powles ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Canada and Australia , said that the United Nations was charged by the international community to address extraordinarily complex issues of international peace and security , as well as urgent economic , social and humanitarian problems , but lacked the adequate and predictable funding required to do so .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Stresses also the continued need for urgent and substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone , as well as for sustained and generous assistance for the longer term tasks of peace-building , reconstruction , economic and social recovery and development in Sierra Leone , and urges all States and international and other organizations to provide such assistance as a priority ;  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
Firstly , the fourteenth preambular paragraph calls on all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in East Timor .  
Expressing its concern at reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in East Timor , stressing that persons committing such violations bear individual responsibility , and calling on all parties to cooperate with investigations into these reports ,  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
Among the many pressing needs are the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of child combatants ; the protection and safe return of internally displaced and refugee children ; the provision of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations composed largely of women and children ; and the registration , protection and reunification of unaccompanied or orphaned children and children in foster families .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
The Under-Secretary-General stated that the Department viewed modules as main thematic areas of action and activities , such as peace and security , economic and social development , human rights , humanitarian assistance and environment , while elements were specific documents and public information products that better illustrated those thematic categories .  
In that connection , the Hungarian Parliament was expected to adopt a decision to reissue the four Geneva Conventions in a single document in the near future and a national interministerial commission on humanitarian law had been established as a practical means of ensuring the enhanced implementation of international humanitarian law in Hungary .  
The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
The easier path towards an acceptable definition of aggression would have to recognize limitations imposed by the Charter , as well as practical limitations reflecting the need for the international community to respond to humanitarian and other crises without being harassed or , much worse , being charged with violations of the Statute .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Iraq , which particularly affects certain vulnerable groups , such as children , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
In paragraph 6 of resolution 1999 / 6 , the Commission requested the Secretary _ General to bring that resolution to the attention of all Governments , the competent United Nations organs , the specialized agencies , regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible publicity , and to report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ sixth session .  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
It was noted that favourable conditions for return could only be achieved if the fundamental causes of displacement were addressed and the State fully implemented the multiple recommendations made by the international community in regard to the protection of human rights and humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Considering that serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law are the foremost direct cause of forced displacement in Colombia , the workshop urged the Government of Colombia to comply with the Guiding Principles and with the international recommendations already made to address the situation , in particular by the United Nations and the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights .  
The new UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests and objectives of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
The report lacks an objective approach to evaluating the repercussions of the implementation of the programme on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq in that it neglects to make a comparative analysis of the present situation and the situation in the relevant sectors as it was prior to the imposition of sanctions and in that it ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social and cultural aspects of life for the Iraqi people , including future generations .  
The representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom in the 661 Committee have held up contracts for this sector , which is one of a humanitarian character , that are worth a total of more than $ 60-million and which include 16 contracts for supplies that are essential and basic to the maintenance of existing water treatment plants and water compact units throughout Iraq .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Reaffirming its objectives , as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
Any consideration of the Iraq sanctions regime should not be artificially forced or hurried if we are to achieve the twin goals of alleviating the grave humanitarian situation in Iraq and ensuring Iraqi compliance with the requirements in respect of its alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Expressing its grave concern for the well-being of internally displaced persons , particularly in Kabul and in the Panjsher , Bamian and Kunduz regions , and for the civilian population of Afghanistan living without shelter , who face a long winter possibly deprived of basic foods as a result of the recent fighting , as well as the denial by the warring factions of adequate conditions for the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations ,  
Reaffirming the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations , which , inter alia , call for collective effort to strengthen friendly relations among nations , remove threats to peace and foster international cooperation in resolving international issues of economic , social , cultural and humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
From the data gathered , the Panel calculated both an estimate of the total amount spent in the global emergency humanitarian relief effort for evacuees and an estimate of the total donations made to Jordan in cash or in kind and relevant costs that had been borne by other Governments and / or international organizations .  
In the resolution , the Commission condemned the widespread , systematic and gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in East Timor , including widespread violations and abuses of the right to life , personal security , physical integrity and the right to property .  
In response to increasing reports of violence and human rights abuses attributed to Indonesian government forces since the beginning of the year , the Special Rapporteur had repeatedly sent urgent appeals to the Government urging the authorities to protect the safety and integrity of the civilian population in East Timor and to ensure that the police and military were conducting their operations in strict compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards . 
The UNSMA Civil Affairs Unit , established in 1999 , will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continued coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross purposes ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
At its eighteenth session ( 17-28 May 1999 ) , the Board of Trustees of the Fund had recommended that , for the period June 1999 to May 2000 , grants of approximately US $ 5.1-million ( A / 54 / 177 , para . 16 ) should be awarded to medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian and legal assistance programmes , which were approved in June 1999 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of the Secretary-General ( paras . 18 and 21 ) .  
In paragraph 8 of the Declaration , the Committee against Torture , the Board of Trustees of the Fund , the Special Rapporteur and the High Commissioner appealed to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously and , if possible , on a regular basis to the Fund , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide . 
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
As soon as a list is drawn up , humanitarian items such as foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , as well as basic or standard medical and agricultural equipment and educational items , will no longer be submitted to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for approval .  
It is precisely for that reason that I , in my dual capacity as representative of the Netherlands and Chairman of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to Security Council resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , am relieved that the present resolution provides for a considerable enhancement of the humanitarian programme , which will be implemented irrespective of whether or not the Iraqi regime chooses to cooperate with the Security Council .  
It emphasized the importance of international cooperation to combat impunity , bearing in mind the basic principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations , underlined the unacceptability of unilateral State action to apply justice extraterritorially , and contended that the right of humanitarian intervention was a dubious effort to confer doctrinal legitimacy on what was really an attempt at geo-political domination .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
As mentioned in my last report ( S / 1999 / 987 ) , UNMIK has also established other consultative mechanisms through which the local population and leadership have been able to participate in the decision-making of the interim administration by providing expert guidance and advice to UNMIK on specific issues , for example in the fields of legislative matters , humanitarian affairs , economic policy , health , education , energy and public utilities .  
In order to address that lack of protection of persons in situations of internal violence , of which five major situations had been identified , it would be useful to identify and draw upon international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , applicable at all times , to all circumstances and to all actors , both governmental and non-governmental , as well as any individual .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
By compiling and analysing the norms reflected in international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law , a global framework of fundamental standards could be elaborated , protecting the individual at all times and in all circumstances .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
One of the purposes of the United Nations is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ( Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter ) .  
There is a renewed global interest in issues relating to exclusion from refugee status , not least because internal conflicts are being conducted in flagrant disregard of international human rights and humanitarian law , and because both persecutors and their victims are often forced by events to seek refuge together .  
One priority of the humanitarian pillar of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo , which is headed by my Special Envoy , is to help these people through the winter we are working hard , together with major governmental partners such as the United States of America , the European Union and Japan and many non-governmental organizations , to meet this deadline.But more intractable problems remain unresolved . 
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in western Timor : first , the Indonesian Government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
In this context , we believe that the General Assembly , as the sole democratic , universal and transparent organ of the United Nations , is the proper forum to carry out an in-depth analysis of the implications of the emerging debate on collective action to address humanitarian catastrophes .  
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
The obstacles experienced during the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the United Nations regarding the oil-for-food formula which all reports and realities indicate can not meet the essential humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq are striking evidence of the American Administrations insistence on harming the people of Iraq and depriving them of their fundamental humanitarian rights , as enshrined in all international covenants .  
Yet this is only one of the many purposes of our Organization ; to achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is no less an important goal in our Charter .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
As the Secretary-General suggests , changing international circumstances including the spread of notions of individual rights and the idea that the international community has a responsibility to respond effectively to humanitarian crises are challenging traditional notions of national sovereignty .  
These include the shelter , management and social reintegration of tens of thousands of displaced persons , a humanitarian tragedy whose scale has not always been clearly perceived by the international community ; the protection of people and property ; the respect of human rights ; and the restoration of normal living conditions in many war-torn communities an overwhelming task that anyone would agree requires means exceeding by far the capacities of a State bled dry such as Congo is today .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
In fact , the challenges of recent years have led the international community to provide pragmatic answers to many of the questions posed by the Secretary-General , not only by the regular actions of humanitarian agencies and the coordinating work of the United Nations , but also , in certain cases , by specific decisions of the Security Council and even by unilateral actions .  
Two requisites are fundamental to our endeavour : first , there must be absolute respect for the Charter and for the competence of the Security Council in the use of force in the international arena , which means consistent respect for the rules and for the process of changing the rules ; and secondly , the legitimacy of the international communitys response to humanitarian crises depends on its commitment to devoting equal attention to equivalent problems .  
As regards the issue of humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty , we associate ourselves with the majority of Member States , especially States of the South , that referred to the contravention by such ideas of international law , the Charter and the principal guidelines in contemporary law such as sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity , as well as non-interference in the internal affairs of others .  
He did not give us a descriptive report , but one based on his prerogatives , responsibilities and discretionary powers , putting forward a vision and initiatives to confront what he views as threats to international peace and security and ideas on how the United Nations could respond to political , humanitarian and human rights crises .  
I wish to reiterate the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to this process , which is aimed at meeting the challenges faced by our countries and our Organization in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character , and in promoting , as well as encouraging , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as mapped out in the Charter of the United Nations .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .  
In affirmation of the growing needs and common requirements of the member States of the OIC , General Assembly resolution 53-16 of 29 October 1998 called for the strengthening of cooperation between our two organizations in the political , social , economic and humanitarian fields , a detailed review of which is contained in the Secretary-General ' s report .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
This agreement , based on the promotion of international cooperation and the solution of problems of a political , economic , social , cultural or humanitarian nature , is designed to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
As a staunch advocate of free trade and relations between nations , on the basis of respect for the norms and principles of international law , and consistent with its own cherished values and traditions , the United States clearly can not persist in its current policy against Cuba , with its serious humanitarian impact on the lives of the valiant Cuban people .  
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
For this success to be sustained , however , it is imperative that member countries garner sufficient political will based on heightened international and national awareness of humanitarian principles .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
At the same time , because of the rather numerous , complex and sensitive aspects involved , the issue needs to be appropriately considered through a comprehensive and level-headed debate in order to promote a more favourable atmosphere for humanitarian aid workers of the United Nations and its agencies , in accordance with the relevant rules and principles .  
We are convinced that the world Organization is the primary body responsible not only for the maintenance of international peace and security , but also for humanitarian assistance and for economic and social development , as set out in the Charter .  
Although humanitarian action takes place in contexts in which political , economic , social and military factors are inextricably connected , it is absolutely vital for humanitarian institutions to preserve the strictly non-political and impartial character of their mission .  
We are confident that a sovereign State of Palestine , with East Jerusalem as its capital and the State of Israel will find an acceptable solution under international guarantees to preserve the political , humanitarian and religious dimensions of the city of Al-Quds , the key to peace .  
Such cooperation must continue to be based on key activities of the international community , first and foremost among which are promoting the prevention and settlement of conflicts , peacekeeping and ensuring the humanitarian aspects of security and development , including respect for human rights and the rights of national minorities , refugees and displaced persons . 
As a logical consequence of the chronically unstable situation in certain parts of the continent and the constantly growing number of refugees generated by its convulsive conflicts , dealing with the humanitarian situation in Africa today is a major challenge to Africans and to the whole international community .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We are committed to working in partnership with Africa to secure peace and democracy , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , political stability and economic and social development .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
Once again , the international community finds itself obliged to take action ; once again , Member States find themselves obliged to resume the tenth emergency special session in the face of Israel ' s intransigence and its insistence on continuing its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , in grave violation of international law , international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Measures such as these , and any others intended to alter the legal status and the demographic composition of the occupied Palestinian territory , are inherently null and void ; they are unlawful and in breach of the fundamental norms of international law and international humanitarian law .  
Deeply concerned by the human rights situation in East Timor , and in particular reports indicating that systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in East Timor , as well as the situation of displaced persons in East and West Timor and elsewhere in the region ,  
Affirms that all persons who commit or authorize violations of human rights or international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations and that the international community will exert every effort to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice , while affirming that the primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice rests with national judicial systems ;  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
Once again he drew the attention of the Burundi authorities to the urgent need to ensure the observance of international standards of humanitarian law and human rights , which prohibited indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and civilian targets during military operations .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and security and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its damaged economy and in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In what could well prove to be an exemplary effort to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement in war-torn areas , international humanitarian and development agencies , and financial institutions have forged partnerships amongst themselves and with the Government with the common aim of assisting the Government in creating possibilities for return as a durable solution .  
Accordingly , it would appear timely to convene a meeting between government officials and representatives of the international community for the purpose of devising a common strategy for addressing not only the present , and very pressing , needs of the internally displaced for continued humanitarian assistance , but also their own expressed desire to become more self-reliant through increased access to opportunities for employment and other means of income-generation .  
To be sure , projects addressing longer-term development needs should be pursued , but in parallel with the continued provision of basic humanitarian relief to those in need and especially to the most vulnerable groups among them , such as the elderly , the disabled and women heads of household , who are likely to continue to need humanitarian assistance regardless of the pace of development .  
In recognition of the fact that they are based on existing human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , the workshop affirmed that the Guiding Principles do not seek to create a privileged category of persons or to establish a separate legal status for the internally displaced .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a report on the status of the additional Protocols , as well as measures taken to strengthen the existing body of international humanitarian law , inter alia , with respect to its dissemination and full implementation at the national level , based on information received from Member States and the International Committee of the Red Cross ;  
While the Dayton Agreement stopped the fighting and the most egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , underlying issues were to a large extent left to the parties to resolve among themselves on the basis of the Dayton principles .  
Torture is one of the vilest acts to be perpetrated by human beings upon one another.The proceeds paid in to the Fund will contribute to projects providing medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide .  
Even where humanitarian objectives were not part of their primary mandates , peacekeeping operations have proved valuable , often vital , in supporting and protecting needy populations , humanitarian workers and supplies in environments where there was limited consent from the warring parties or when the security situation is simply beyond their control .  
My delegation welcomes this briefing and future briefings on this important subject , which has a direct bearing on the primary responsibility of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security as it deals more and more with the issue of the humanitarian dimensions of conflicts around the world , especially given the new and more pernicious forms of conflict in our contemporary world .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
WFP welcomed the Principles as a well-formulated consolidation of relevant elements of existing international human rights and humanitarian law , presented in clear , concise language which would increase international awareness of the specific problems internally displaced persons confront as well as the legal norms relevant to addressing their needs .  
Principle 25 provides that international humanitarian organizations and other appropriate actors have the right to offer their services in support of the internally displaced , that such an offer shall not be regarded as an unfriendly act or an interference in a States affairs and shall be considered in good faith , and that consent thereto shall not be arbitrarily withheld , particularly when authorities concerned are unable or unwilling to provide the required humanitarian assistance .  
Those approached for consultation include representatives of the office of the Secretary-General and of the ERC , relevant United Nations and other international agencies and organizations engaged in human rights , humanitarian and development work , and academic experts familiar with the issue of internal displacement and the mandate .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Strongly deploring the rising toll of casualties among humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , and strongly condemning the acts of physical violence and harassment to which those participating in humanitarian operations are too frequently exposed ,  
Reaffirms the necessity for humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel to be properly informed , inter alia , by their sponsoring organizations of the scope of their activities and the standards that they are required to meet , including those contained in relevant domestic and international law , and suitably trained so as to enhance their security and effectiveness in accomplishing their functions ;  
A civic training programme , centred mainly on essential aspects of democracy , the South African Constitution , the Human Rights Charter , international humanitarian law , cultural diversity and military ethics , has been published in a manual entitled South African National Defense Force Civic Education Guidelines and is being implemented .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The religious denominations and non _ traditional religious groups in Azerbaijan engage in charitable activities , assist a wide variety of communities , provide humanitarian assistance and visit boarding schools , homes for the disabled , hospitals and places of detention , providing material and moral support .  
While it recognized the distinct nature of peacekeeping operations and humanitarian activities , it also saw a need to grapple with the unfortunate reality , which increasingly required the Department to take a proactive role in protecting humanitarian assistance in complex conflict situations .  
Participants recognized the important role played by migrants in their relations , and expressed determination to act , both at the multilateral and the bilateral level , to ensure that migrants from any country are treated in full compliance with human rights , basic freedoms and humanitarian principles .  
Contrary to the degrading , inhumane and brutal treatment of detainees held by the Taliban , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , in the light of the fundamental criteria of humanitarian treatment and respect for human dignity , has approached Taliban captives with care .  
The International Scientific and Educational Znanie Association is an international non-profit alliance of national and other non-governmental organizations which was voluntarily established and based on dissemination of scientific , technical and humanitarian knowledge for mutual benefit .  
The current conflict in the Congo has led to a deepening humanitarian crisis , exacerbated the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , impeded the delivery of critical food and medical assistance , and in general hampered international and domestic efforts towards development and democracy .  
Our approach is guided by a set of basic principles : the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; the belief that there can be no military solution to the underlying problems of the region ; and the belief that the human and humanitarian rights of all peoples in the conflict must be respected .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
The systematic , widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq , resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad _ based discrimination and widespread terror ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
The Nordic countries considered that the primary rules had now been codified in the major fields of international law , including treaty law , diplomatic and consular law , human rights law , the law of the sea and humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote cooperation between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
We remain keenly aware of the role that international law plays in the search for solutions to the problems of an interdependent world in which economic , social and humanitarian issues have assumed paramount importance .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
In the face of the major challenges posed by current humanitarian emergencies , it is our understanding that it is up to the Member States to adopt measures to provide political and logistic support so as to better meet the needs for assistance .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
The Republic of Korea shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about the human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
The legal ground for action is the United Nations Charter and international law , particularly international humanitarian law , the law of refugees and political , civil , economic , social and cultural human rights law .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Germany further supports UNSMA 's new Civil Affairs Unit , which will work inside Afghanistan with the primary objective of promoting respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and systematic violations of human rights in the future .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
Furthermore , the teaching of human rights and international humanitarian law , adapted to each educational level , has not been incorporated into the curriculum as a compulsory subject .  
It has failed , for example , to address longstanding conflicts with massive human suffering and systematic violations of international humanitarian law in a timely and effective manner .  
The basis for the Security Council 's action is , above all , the recognition that flagrant , grave and systematic violations of universally accepted international humanitarian and human rights law may pose a real threat to international peace and security .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
The Council further stressed the importance of a coordinated international response to economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems , which are often the root causes of armed conflicts .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
It is a vexing and tragic mosaic of suffering , and its seemingly endless civil war exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation , as we heard in the briefing this morning .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
Although it acknowledged the complexity of the issue , his delegation considered that generalized violations of the rules of international humanitarian law that killed and seriously injured innocent civilians were impermissible .  
The Republic of Korea fully shares the humanitarian concerns of the international community about human suffering and tragic casualties caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel landmines .  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
The mention of the existing legal framework , including the Charter , international humanitarian law and human rights and refugee law , although considered inadequate , appears to be comprehensive .  
Selfevaluation focuses on the subprogramme and can be applied to all sectors , including political , legal , humanitarian , economic and social affairs , public information and common services .  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 6 above shall not apply to supplies of nonlethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use , as approved in advance by the Committee established by paragraph 8 below ;  
An unflinching review must be the starting point for suggesting ways to initiate reforms designed to transform a tentative success into a decisive and irreversible step in the progress of international humanitarian law .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
Acknowledging the key role played by the United Nations under the Charter in the peaceful settlement of international disputes and in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character ,  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  
Its record was undeniable : it was democratically governed , it respected human rights , its people were energetic , imaginative and courageous and its economic power and humanitarian attributes were acknowledged around the world .  
The prohibition on attacks against civilians is based on the most fundamental distinction drawn in international humanitarian law between the civilian and the military and the absolute prohibition on directing attacks against the former .  
The first threeweek period of full control by these entities over Freetown marked the most intensified , systematic and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law against the civilian population .  
Encourages Member States to appoint suitably qualified female permanent representatives to United Nations missions and suitably qualified female heads of delegations dealing with major economic , social , security , human rights and humanitarian issues ;  
Strengthen the OAU institutional and human resources capacity in the areas of humanitarian early warning , rapid disaster response and the timely and effective coordination and interaction with member States and regional organizations in disaster situations ;  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Following positive reactions from a number of Governments and international organizations , BTF carried out a detailed feasibility study to define the exact scientific and associated financial requirements for the humanitarian cleanup of the hot spots .  
We believe that the additional Protocol is potentially the most effective legal instrument that the international community can use to resolve the humanitarian problems caused by the indiscriminate , irresponsible use of antipersonnel mines .  
Encourages Member States to appoint suitably qualified female permanent representatives to United Nations missions and suitably qualified female heads of delegations dealing with major economic , social , security , human rights and humanitarian issues ;  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
In the light of the intensifying fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation , I decided to convene a meeting of the six plus two group on 15 September at the level of foreign ministers .  
However , the tragic murder in August of seven Afghan workers of the United Nationssupported mine awareness programme by an unidentified armed band in western Afghanistan confirmed the everyday risks faced by humanitarian personnel .  
Within a short space of time , what had hitherto been internal , national provincial border has become international in nature , with all the political , legal , and not least social and humanitarian ramifications .  
It is equally intolerable that the intense fighting is hindering the access of humanitarian agencies to many regions , particularly the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , depriving vulnerable populations of the precious assistance they so sorely need .  
It requires comprehensive strategies involving all relevant actors and embracing multiple sectors of activity , including political , military , diplomatic , development , human rights , humanitarian and many others .  
The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
National Governments and local authorities are called upon to respond properly and in a timely fashion to the political , economic , social and humanitarian circumstances that have the potential to lead to armed conflict or to the intensification of an ongoing conflict .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
Worthy of particular note in his report was the message conveyed to the Mission by the heads of State of the region , who thought that greater subregional integration in the political , security , economic and social spheres should remain a key objective for the United Nations family if durable solutions to conflict and to the tragic humanitarian suffering that accompanies conflict are to be secured .  
The exceptional complexity of this precarious situation in terms of security , humanitarian , economic , social and political matters can no longer be addressed through piecemeal , sectoral or ad hoc responses .  
In my delegations view , the mission sent a strong signal and conveyed the Security Councils genuine , unanimous determination to move ahead in the peace process , to put an end to the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to take up the question of the massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law that have been taking place on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the aggression began . 
Thus , the sanctions , the search for a political solution , and the humanitarian and economic efforts all need to be taken as a whole and pursued as parts of an integrated strategy leading to a broad based and responsible government in Afghanistan .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
While welcoming the fact that access to vulnerable populations is improving , we note that faltering security remains a constant threat to crucial humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts , as illustrated by the deplorable attack on six workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) in April .  
The political , economic , environmental , social , humanitarian , information and many other components of preventive activities are coming to the fore .  
In summing up , the basic issue before us today is the following choice between two alternatives : either we seize this opportunity to radically simplify and promote the flow of everyday civilian goods into Iraq , thereby establishing beyond any doubt that the international community is giving paramount importance to humanitarian concerns , while keeping sensitive goods under control ; or we preserve the status quo .  
It is clear that the Government of Iraq is indifferent to the humanitarian dimension of this issue , because it refuses to resume its participation in the meetings of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , whose meetings it boycotted in January 1998 on the basis of unjustifiable political pretexts despite the humanitarian suffering of those innocent prisoners , their families and loved ones .  
In this regard , we call on the Security Council and the international community to redouble their efforts to convince the Government of Iraq to be more forthcoming and positive in addressing this issue and to resolve the entire matter on humanitarian , religious and moral grounds and in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .  
In the meantime , we reaffirm our firm condemnation of the ongoing pillage of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which , according to credible sources , is the principal reason for the continuation of the conflict and for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The main objective of the Kindu deployment , which would be robust enough to deter any potential attackers , would be to establish a secure base from which civilian personnel who deal with disarmament , demobilization , reintegration , repatriation ( DDRR ) and human rights issues and provide humanitarian assistance would be able to go into the area to carry out their work .  
In his speech at the beginning of this month at the annual conference of his party , Mr . Tony Blair , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , referring to a moral duty to provide international military and humanitarian assistance to any country in need , stressed that if the world continued to ignore the suffering of the African nations , like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , ravaged by war , that would incite anger and frustration that could threaten global stability . 
Although the sanctions were designed to specifically target the illegal activities of Liberias elite , and not intended to harm the lives of ordinary Liberians , the report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has confirmed the bleak humanitarian situation of the population in Liberia .  
According to Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction . . . .  
UNOMIG reported that in several regions of Georgia , including Abkhazia , one of the greatest threats to the local population , representatives of the international humanitarian organizations and United Nations personnel , seemed to come from loosely organized and poorly commanded paramilitary organizations , some of which may be supported by political circles while others were exclusively criminally motivated .  
Consultations between Governments , development agencies and organizations of civil society should be intensified in order to seek innovative solutions to development-related problems , and the results of major United Nations conferences should be applied by means of compliance with the agreed goals and undertakings , bearing in mind that contributions to humanitarian assistance should not be made at the expense of development assistance . 
The former instrument had required direct incorporation of the principle of individual responsibility into existing norms of international humanitarian law ; the Rules of Procedure and Evidence had rightly combined various traditional and procedural traditions .  
The Special Rapporteur then examines the differences between traditional and new forms of mercenary activities , the relationship between terrorism and mercenary activities , the problems raised in connection with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law by private security and military assistance companies operating internationally and the limits and shortcomings of the legal definition of mercenary activities .  
Such arrangements are preferable because they are regulated by clear legal provisions , act in accordance with a transparent line of command and are fully responsible for any violations of international humanitarian law or human rights .  They are also familiar with the territory and the peoples where they operate .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The statement provided an opportunity to recall the inclusive and broad-based process through which the Principles were developed , their basis in existing international human rights and humanitarian law and refugee law by analogy , and to inform delegates of the ways in which the Principles were proving valuable to international organizations , NGOs , displaced communities and also to Governments . 23 .  As a sign of the increased and welcome emphasis on internal displacement , a panel discussion on the issue was convened during the Segment , moderated by the Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
First and foremost , they are to engage in dialogue with national and local authorities , in particular to impress upon them their primary responsibility for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law , as elaborated in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement .  
Australia particularly deplored the human rights situation of women and girls in Afghanistan as a result of the Talibans strict social policies , and appealed to all Afghan factions to respect universal human rights standards and to abide by the principles of international law by allowing free and safe access for United Nations personnel to deliver vitally needed humanitarian aid .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Among the facts which the report fails to mention are the initial study of ideas on a cease-fire and termination of hostilities designed to provide a climate more favourable to the building of peace ; the agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law in the zone proposed for peace talks with the ELN ; and the ELNs unilateral and unconditional return of individuals whom it was holding .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
The reply describes emergency humanitarian assistance for the displaced population ; direct emergency humanitarian assistance for cases of mass displacement ; non-food aid for mass displacements ; individual and family humanitarian assistance ; and a scheme of independently-managed humanitarian assistance which is not confined to emergency humanitarian support but involves major investments to help restore the social and economic stability of the displaced population .  
It should also be noted that serious offences against international humanitarian law , as defined in the Criminal Code , are much more severely punished when members of the armed forces are accused , and acts formerly treated as ordinary crimes are also covered .  
It is our belief that the final goal of the implementation of the Dayton Accords should be the creation of a multi-ethnic , multicultural , united state of Bosnia and Herzegovina that is based on the democratic and humanitarian ideals of modern Europe and oriented in its development towards integration into the European Union and friendship and cooperation with other democratic States of the region .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
This will also include coordinating the development of common policies on humanitarian issues ; improving the management and practice of humanitarian coordination through the enhancement of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned ; ensuring that gender-sensitive strategies are incorporated in humanitarian action plans ; increasing support for and awareness of humanitarian assistance issues and international humanitarian law in the work of the United Nations and its Member States ; and intensifying resource mobilization .  
Emphasis will be given to ensuring a more timely and better coordinated response to situations calling for humanitarian assistance in the event of natural disasters and complex emergencies , providing improved support to the resident or humanitarian coordinators and implementing field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations .  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
Recall that article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination already contains the obligation to provide effective protection and remedies for everyone against any acts of racial discrimination which violate human rights and fundamental freedoms , a principle reaffirmed by numerous subsequent human rights instruments including the basic principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
The role of the Saudi Government in this matter is limited to providing a safe haven and economic , educational , social and religious services and health care on a fraternal and humanitarian basis .  
In response to that tragic situation , the Commission on Human Rights had convened its fifth special session from 17 to 19 October 2000 , at Geneva ; at that session it had adopted an important resolution condemning the provocative visit by the Likud party leader , which had triggered the tragic events , as well as the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by Israel , in violation of international humanitarian law .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Lebanese Government for the impartial attitude adopted by the United Nations in southern Lebanon following the recent Israeli threats in connection with this matter and to thank the Organization for UNIFILs continued fulfilment of its mandate and , in particular , for the humanitarian assistance and medical care it provides to the local inhabitants and for its active participation in the task of clearing the mines laid by Israel in the area .  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto ,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
The review revealed progress in a number of areas , including administrative reform and state modernization at the central level , capacity-building within national institutions for humanitarian coordination and community empowerment to promote participatory local development in selected provinces , with special emphasis on youth and women .  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its call upon the Russian Federation to establish , according to recognized international standards , a national broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate promptly alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation in order to establish the truth and identify those responsible , with a view to bringing them to justice and preventing impunity ;  
Expresses serious concern over the slow pace of investigating alleged serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians and notes with concern that very few such cases have reached the judicial system ;  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Urges the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure international , regional and national humanitarian organizations , notably those of the United Nations and their implementing partners as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross , free , unimpeded and secure access to the Republic of Chechnya and neighbouring republics of the Russian Federation , in accordance with international humanitarian law , and to facilitate their activities , including the delivery of humanitarian aid , inter alia by simplifying regulations , and their access to a radio communication network for the United Nations ;  
Encourages Governments , United Nations bodies and organs , the specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as appropriate , to initiate , coordinate or support programmes designed to train and educate military forces , law enforcement officers and government officials , as well as members of United Nations peacekeeping or observer missions , on human rights and humanitarian law issues connected with their work , and appeals to the international community to support endeavours to that end ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ;  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are individually responsible and accountable for those violations ,  
The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia , including the efforts by the Attorney-General of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999 .  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
As stated in its resolution 1291 ( 2000 ) of 24 February 2000 , the Security Council , inter alia , authorized MONUC to consist of political , human rights , humanitarian affairs , public information , child protection and medical and administrative support components .  
The suffering of Palestinian children caused by Israeli acts of aggression aimed at killing and maiming children , coupled with the lack of facilities to shelter them , Israels abandonment of all values and human rights and its flouting of all international instruments , and its refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to establish a just peace in accordance with the legitimate decisions of the international community , causing heightened suffering among the Arab population under occupation and denying their children all the rights enshrined in the precepts of God and humanitarian law .  
The committee meets with the Council when any change in the mandate is contemplated , in particular , the broadening or narrowing of scope of the mission , the introduction of new or additional functions or components , or a change in the authorization to use force ; the renewal of a mandate ; significant or serious political , military or humanitarian developments ; a rapid deterioration of the security situation on the ground ; the termination , withdrawal or scaling down in size of the operation , including the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict peace-building .  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
It also agreed to the importance of peace-building as a broad-based approach to conflict prevention , and stressed the need to address the political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic root causes of conflicts .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
The humanitarian consequences of the increasingly difficult operating environment include : reduced ability to work with or access women ; inability to reach populations that are a low priority for the Taliban authorities ; and generally increased costs or difficulty in implementing assistance projects to the extent that otherwise viable projects have to be considered for closure . 
France sought to justify its conduct in removing the two officers from the island of Hao on the ground of circumstances of distress in a case of extreme urgency involving elementary humanitarian considerations affecting the acting organs of the State . [ 70 ] The Tribunal unanimously accepted that this plea was admissible in principle , and by majority that it was applicable to the facts of one of the two cases . 
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
In contrast to economic , social and cultural rights , international humanitarian law is not subject to progressive realization , but must always be implemented immediately .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the prevailing rules of international humanitarian law and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations , or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
Concrete and verified information about massive displacements of people , security conditions , and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law can be vital for distressed populations and international aid workers alike .  Where communications are disrupted , using the media to inform distressed populations about the activities of relief agencies , and about the location of shelter , food , water and medical services , can be critical for alleviating human suffering .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
He expressed his dismay at the persistent failure of the warring parties to abide by international humanitarian norms and to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable for their actions .  
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan stated in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session that , in order to deter and prevent the occurrence of such atrocities , an effective international initiative was needed to expose and hold to account those responsible for war crimes , breaches of international humanitarian law and gross violations of human rights .  
Synergy and complementarity of the action taken by the various agencies will be decisive in mobilizing sufficient funds both to meet the challenges represented by the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to seize the opportunities offered by the new political , economic and military situation .  The strategy for ending the crisis itself must combine humanitarian action and intervention for the purpose of rehabilitation and development .  
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
To standardize police training and adapt it to the Sierra Leone environment , the Section has finalized arrangements with the UNAMSIL Civilian Police to produce a training manual for the police , internal human rights awareness training for incoming UNAMSIL peacekeepers and military observers occurs on a regular basis and the Section provided training on human rights and humanitarian law for the Pakistani Brigade in Pakistan prior to its deployment to UNAMSIL .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
However , it is now well known that SPLM / A , continuing its intransigent stance , not only vehemently opposed the proposed immediate ceasefire , but also provoked the situation by launching intensive military operations in western Bahr-El-Ghazal state , causing the loss of the lives of a considerable number of innocent civilians and the displacement of thousands of others , thus creating , once again , a humanitarian crisis in the state and its immediate environs , as it did in early 1998 .  
Reaffirming the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations on achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination or distinction as to race , colour , sex , social class , descent , national or ethnic origin , language or religion ,  
Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as set forth in the Charter , is the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
In addition , Article 1 calls for achieving international cooperation to solve international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character , and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
After so many years of fruitless endeavours , the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations , in particular the Security Council , might wish to consider adopting a comprehensive approach to the settlement of Afghanistan , in its political , military , humanitarian and human rights dimensions , setting forth the basic requirements for a settlement of the conflict and the principles on which it should be based , together with a coherent strategy to resolve the conflict .  
The Advisory Group has also pursued the creation of a legal framework for international urban search and rescue operations , a project that received considerable support from Member States in the recently concluded humanitarian affairs segment of the Economic and Social Council .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
The Secretary-General has also recommended the Member States ensure that their military , civilian and police personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations be trained with regard to international human rights , humanitarian law and refugee law , especially as concerns the rights and protection of children and women , in advance of troop deployment to United Nations operations .  
Despite the increasing pressure from the civil society for a political settlement of the conflict , fighting has continued unabated with dire humanitarian consequences .  
The mission , which had met with government representatives and a broad cross section of humanitarian partners and visited internally displaced persons locations in Bi , Huambo and Luanda provinces , expressed concern over allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , including forced relocation , targeting of civilians , forced conscription , looting of humanitarian supplies and sexual violence .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .  
The radio will provide accurate , credible and impartial information about all aspects of the peace process , including military and political developments , the inter-Congolese dialogue and the many humanitarian assistance programmes operating in the country .  
Preparations are under way for recruitment and deployment of adequate numbers of United Nations civilian personnel to accompany the military deployment , including political , human rights , humanitarian , child protection , public information , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration and logistical personnel .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
While , by their nature , countries and Governments could be held accountable for compliance with the relevant rules governing the protection of those engaged in humanitarian work , non-State actors continued to show complete disregard for them .  
The Sudan renewed its commitment to its position of principle advocating respect for the norms of international humanitarian law , bilateral agreements and national legislation on the part of all parties involved in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations , and it called for full account to be taken of the guiding principles for humanitarian assistance annexed to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 .  
The revised concept of operation of UNAMSIL is based on the forward deployment , in successive phases and in an integrated fashion , of the Missions military force of 17,500 personnel as well as United Nations civil affairs , civilian police and human rights personnel , representatives of humanitarian agencies and government personnel and assets to establish and consolidate State authority and basic services in areas controlled by RUF , including diamond producing regions , and in some border areas .  
There was no doubt that the brutal imposition of comprehensive sanctions , exacting vengeance on an entire people , were a continuing flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter , of international law and of international humanitarian law .  
Ensure the selection , acquisition and maintenance of documents and publications regarding international law , international legal material , humanitarian law and national law relevant to the operations of the Tribunal for the use of judges , staff and defence counsel ; and provide online information services to assist staff , in particular the legal officers and judges , with legal research and greater access to bibliographic information ; ( b ) Conference and language support activities :  
The additional $ 276,631 will be divided among the survival , development , and protection and promotion programmes , with $ 100,000 being allocated to the survival programme to further increase access to basic health and nutrition ; $ 100,000 to the development programme in support of reaching large numbers of children through formal primary education ; and $ 76,631 to address advocacy with national authorities , civil society and the humanitarian assistance community on the rights of children and women .  
While the emergence of a broad-based and representative government through an inclusive participatory process may take some time , the failure to take the initial interim measures promptly , to meet urgent security needs and to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance could well jeopardize the entire process .  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Also encourages in such operations the sharing of geographical data , including remotely sensed images and geographic information system and global positioning system data among Governments , space agencies and relevant international humanitarian organizations , as appropriate , and notes in that context the work being done by the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters and the Global Disaster Information Network ;  
Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .

We stress that determining the future of Afghanistan is the exclusive and inalienable right of the Afghans themselves , who are faced with the task of building a renewed State that lives in peace and harmony with its neighbours and the international community as a whole , and we call for increased humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and the elaboration of a broad international programme for the post-war restoration of Afghanistans national economy .

Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian and development problems caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded ordnance that constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions , and that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-affected countries ,
