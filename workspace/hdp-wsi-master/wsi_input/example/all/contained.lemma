In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .

Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
My specific proposal is to suggest that the Fifth Committee , after adoption of the draft resolution by the Main Committee concerned on the basis of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , will take note of the estimate of additional requirements contained in the programme budget implications , on the understanding that such additional appropriation as may be necessary will be determined in the context of a revised appropriation , taking into account all relevant information , including the performance report .

The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .

That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .

Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
TAKASU ( Controller ) emphasized that the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) were not intended to change the procedures governing the financing of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , but rather the aim was simply to increase the annual limit of $ 5 million established by General Assembly resolutions 48 / 229 and 50 / 217 .  NULLThe three categories of activities covered by those resolutions were presented in table 1 of the report .  
Whether its mandate is still required gives rise to the question posed in paragraph 25 of my report of 30 January 1996 ( S / 1996 / 65 ) : how does one measure the success of a preventive operation and judge that if it is reduced or withdrawn peace and stability will continue to hold , threats and tensions that have so far been contained will disappear and channels or institutions for defusing them will continue to be built or consolidated ? 
It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
It has since been determined that the list contained several apparent errors : it included an individual who had already been granted amnesty , a number of non-combatants , several elderly persons and at least one person who died some years ago .  
It was recognized that respect for the rights of the accused were fundamental and reflected the credibility of the Court and that there was already a large body of international law on the subject , as contained in such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and the statutes of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals , which should be elaborated in the statute .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The list of functionally defined , transferable fields contained in the Schedule is not exhaustive ; however , transfer of legislative and executive powers in fields other than those listed in the Schedule is subject to prior agreement between the Home Rule Authority and the central authorities of the realm .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The Inspectors note that the questions raised and recommendations made in the report are similar in nature to those contained in the JIU report entitled " Staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) " ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 , annex ) which , although not referenced in the report , was welcomed by the Secretary-General as a valuable and timely contribution to both the planning and management aspects of field operations and approved by the General Assembly .  
In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .  Part one had been completed in 1980 , and since then the Commission had concentrated on parts two and three .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
While different legal systems contained varying provisions concerning the validity of an arbitral award , no existing international instrument or customary practice envisaged the possibility that an arbitral award in an international dispute would not be implemented as a result of objections raised by one party to the dispute .  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Against this background , the preparation of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has to be welcomed as a major step forward at the international level in translating many of the recommendations contained in the above _ mentioned Council of Europe text , into binding internatonal norms , thus protecting children more effectively against the various forms of sexual exploitation .  Available for consultation with the Secretariat .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
China is ready to work with the countries concerned in accordance with the established basic principles and legal regime , as contained in recognized international law and contemporary law of the sea including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to achieve an appropriate settlement of disputes through peaceful negotiations . 
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 5 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The delegation that had introduced a revised version of document A / AC . 252 / L . 2 ( A / AC . 252 / 1997 / WP . 10 and 12 ) as a result of the first round of discussions noted that the changes introduced in article 1 , paragraph 4 , contained an enlarged definition of armed forces that included the security forces and restricted the concept of other persons accompanying them to those who acted in support of the armed forces and were under their command and control .  
Five years have elapsed since we signed the historic Rio Declaration and agreed to a series of commitments , contained in Agenda 21 , on economic , social and environmental development .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Further , it should be emphasized that all allegations contained in the interim report had been transmitted to the Government during the course of 1996 by special rapporteurs and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights , including the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , on the question of torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
With regard to bilateral and multilateral treaties , the five States reported that they had signed a significant number of treaties concerning the protection of the environment , some of which contained penal provisions , and had implemented them in national legislation .  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
In addition to a general definition of certification authority , the revised definitional article should contain a definition of licensed , authorized or accredited certification authorities , which could be based on paragraph ( 1 ) of draft article B . As to the elements contained in paragraphs ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of the draft article , they should be reflected in the portion of the guide to enactment of the draft uniform rules corresponding to the definition of authorized certification authorities . 
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
At this meeting , the advance party informed the representatives that the Special Rapporteurs had found the clarifications and assurances contained in Note No . 57 / 97 unsatisfactory and that they would delay their arrival in Nigeria until they received assurances that they would be allowed to meet the detainees whose names had been transmitted to the Government in the note verbale from the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights dated 13 February 1997 .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
At its forty-fourth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1992 / 29 , expressed its deep appreciation to the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , for his final report on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 202 to 246 of that report and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible distribution of the reports of the Special Rapporteur .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Despite the advances that have been registered in the processes of national reconstruction and development , on which I shall be submitting a separate report to the General Assembly pursuant to the request contained in Assembly resolution 50 / 58 C of 12 December 1995 , the technical and financial assistance of the international community remains necessary .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
In this connection , the Special Representative and the troika stressed once again that it was imperative that UNITA provide credible data concerning the numbers and locations of armed elements under its control , and expressed their grave concern at the inaction of UNITA in fulfilling the demands contained in Security Council resolution 1118 ( 1997 ) and the presidential statement of 23 July .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
Provision of $ 1,519,800 is made for the salaries of international civilian personnel based on the phased reduction of personnel as detailed in the table contained in paragraph 22 of the main report and annex IV and includes the provision of eight person / months for the completion of residual administrative tasks in New York by the Chief Finance Officer ( P-4 ) and one Field Service staff member beyond 31 December 1997 .  
UNCLOS is acknowledged to be an " umbrella convention " because most of its provisions , being of a general nature , can only be implemented through specific operative regulations to be contained in other international agreements or national law .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
In coming up with the recommendations contained in paragraph 79 ( d ) , the Panel benefited greatly from the presence of a Canadian expert among its members and through him received valuable inputs from the Canadian Government based on its extensive past experiences and lessons learnt in connection with the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .

The Organization of American States , for example , stated on 13 September that nuclear tests being carried out in the South Pacific pose a potential risk to the health and security of surrounding States and their living resources and environment , and do not take into account the precautionary principle contained in the Rio Declaration on environment and development and in other regional agreements .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 50 / 291 and the special meeting of the First Committee as well as other events traditionally held in observance of Disarmament Week have once again proven that the international community continues to rely on Disarmament Week as an appropriate occasion for further promoting national and international activities to educate and inform the public about major disarmament issues and developments .  
Nuclear tests pose a potential risk to the health and security of the people of coastal States and to their natural resources and environment , contrary to the precautionary principle on international environmental law contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , the Convention on Biological Diversity , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change , the Treaty of Maastricht and other international instruments .  
The Secretary-General of the United Nations , in his report on the three Regional Centres , contained in document A / 50 / 380 of 25 August 1995 , recognized and strongly emphasized the importance of the role that such institutions can play in drawing up , at the regional level , confidence-building measures , measures to strengthen social and political stability and the security of States , and to help in the limitation and neutralization of existing arsenals .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development [ 4 ] / is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Note by the Secretariat on draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session ( E / CN . 5 / 1995 / L . 3 ) .  
None the less , some of the objectives of the Task Force are being addressed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics , which was established in 1992 with a membership of international and national statistical agencies to implement the recommendations contained in two IMF reports : " Report on the measurement of international capital flows " and " Report on the world current account discrepancy " .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
The implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country , consistent with national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its people , and in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
On the other hand , some delegations held the view that there was an inseparable link between the procedural law contained in the draft statute and the substantive law of the draft Code , and suggested that , for the Court to function effectively , it was essential to complete the work of the draft Code , which would substantially clarify the Court 's jurisdiction ratione materiae .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
Most recently , the competent Iraqi authorities concerned made a careful examination of the Kuwaiti list contained in document S / 1995 / 39 and informed the Secretariat that the necessary steps would be taken to return any property discovered as a result of the previous investigation ( Iraqi letter dated 27 February 1995 , circulated as a Security Council document ) .  
The chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women , and that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
For these reasons , many non-nuclear-weapon States continued to express strong preference for a multilateral , legally binding international accord , which would be equal in status to the obligations contained in the non-proliferation Treaty .  
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 and the relevant request of the Legal Counsel , UNDCP and CPCJB have reviewed the draft statute for an international criminal court contained in the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session .  3 / The review was carried out in the light of the legislative mandates of both bodies and from the point of view of their substantive competence .  
In decision 1993 / 239 , the Economic and Social Council took note of draft decision III , entitled " Contribution of comprehensive national social policies to societal management and to the solving of economic , environmental , demographic , cultural and political problems " , contained in the report of the Commission for Social Development on its thirty-third session , 1 / and requested the Commission to reconsider it at its thirty-fourth session .

Colombia is a unique case in Latin America , a country in which moderate and persistent inflation has attracted the attention of important national and international analysts who have been able to provide sound macroeconomic explanations for that inflation ; such experts have never resorted to the explanation contained in the DEA report .  
Most recently , in 1993 , the Organization retained the services of a well-known travel consultant to draft a request for proposal , which contained stringent requirements concerning measurable performance standards and required that offers included a proposed budget for the travel agency to permit a better understanding of the financial considerations with a view to maximizing the monetary gain for the Organization .  
Indeed , discussion of the issue has never been so extensive : the chairpersons stressed that all human rights contained in the international instruments applied fully to women ; that the equal enjoyment of those rights should be closely monitored by each treaty body within the competence of its mandate ; and that a common strategy should be developed by the treaty bodies in that regard .  
On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
His detailed and insightful twelfth progress report on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) , contained in document S / 1995 / 781 , which forms the basis of this meeting , gives an account of the gains that have been made in the peace process and proposes specific actions for the Council to take in order to ensure that the current momentum towards a final resolution of the Liberian conflict is maintained .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
In resolution 49 / 21 I , the General Assembly emphasized the necessity of designing a new programme for international cooperation with Central America , based on the principles established in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of CIREFCA , at a meeting held in Mexico City in June 1994 , and the regional strategy contained within the Alliance for Sustainable Development .  
In addition , the Commission decided to authorize the request of the Subcommission , contained in resolution 1994 / 4 , to establish , initially for a three-year period , an intersessional working group consisting of five of its members to meet each year for five working days in order to promote the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , and in particular to :  
Following on the plenary meeting , in a meeting devoted to Iraq 's biological weapons programme , Iraq for the first time disclosed a much more extensive programme than that contained in its full , final and complete disclosure of early August 1995 , admitting weaponization immediately prior to the outbreak of the Gulf war , including the filling of biological warfare agents into 166 bombs and 25 Al Hussein missile warheads .  
" Accordingly , I would be most grateful to continue benefitting from the cooperation of your Excellency 's Government so that I may provide the Commission and the General Assembly with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the situation of economic , social , cultural , civil , and political rights in Myanmar in accordance with the provisions contained in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995 / 72 .  
The offensive in western Bosnia , whose ultimate goal is the seizure of Prijedor and Banja Luka , is continuing unabated despite the demands of the Security Council contained in the presidential statement of 12 October 1995 ( S / PRST / 1995 / 52 ) , that all parties fully comply with the provisions of the cease-fire agreement and refrain from any military activity that could seriously jeopardize the peace process . 
The Council then approved the provisional calendar of conferences and meetings for 1996 and 1997 in the economic , social and related fields as contained in documents E / 1995 / L . 20 and Add . 1 and 2 , as revised by the adoption of the draft decision contained in document E / 1995 / L . 68 and on the understanding that the dates of the special session of the Commission for Social Development would be determined at a later date .

The core of what the sponsors of the amendments thought was contained in amendment 7 , concerning the thirteenth preambular paragraph , which recognized " that the wishes of the peoples in the Territories with regard to their political status can be ascertained by referendums and other forms of popular consultation , including free and fair elections conducted by the Governments of the Territories . "  
As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .

Federation was also dissatisfied with the part of the ICSC annual report dealing with the Geneva survey , which stated that staff representatives had threatened to make public any anomalous situations contained in the survey , thus breaching the confidentiality of the data provided by the participating employers .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;

In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
We are convinced that with the adoption of the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 73 we have succeeded in taking an important step forward towards the objective of revitalizing the economic and social sectors of the United Nations , so as to permit them fully to discharge their mandate in the area of international cooperation for development , as embodied in the Charter .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
Faced with the threat to mankind posed by the rise in sea levels , global warming , creeping desertification and the disappearance of biological diversity , Benin attaches the utmost importance to implementation of all the agreements reached in Rio and , here , renews its commitment to doing all it can to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly planned for June 1997 to strengthen implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Earth Summit contained in Agenda 21 .  
We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and our support for this unique international institution that bears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian , social , economic and political problems and that attempts to find effective solutions to these problems in accordance with the high ideals contained in the Charter for the establishment of a peaceful , secure and prosperous world in which cooperation should prevail .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The Declaration contained a clear conceptual framework for global action on the basis of the priorities upon which we all agreed : peace based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and supported by an effective regime of collective security ; development in all its aspects in the social and economic fields ; sovereign equality among States and respect for peoples ' rights ; and justice in addressing the various issues on the international agenda .  
My specific proposal is to suggest that the Fifth Committee , after adoption of the draft resolution by the Main Committee concerned on the basis of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , will take note of the estimate of additional requirements contained in the programme budget implications , on the understanding that such additional appropriation as may be necessary will be determined in the context of a revised appropriation , taking into account all relevant information , including the performance report .  
It is therefore gratifying to note from his latest report , contained in A / 51 / 390 , that Antarctica continues to play a critical role as a centre for scientific programmes and for peaceful cooperation among States and in improving our understanding of its environment and its dependent and associated ecosystem .  
This fourth special session will provide an opportunity to review the question of the comprehensive programme of disarmament , and will allow us to reconsider objectively the impressive architecture contained in the Final Document of the first special session devoted to disarmament , without diverting us from the priorities we collectively established in 1978 .  
The Constitution contained provisions entitling women to remedial and affirmative action , with a view to enabling them to participate in political , economic and social life and gain access to positions in public and private institutions on an equal footing with men .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
In the light of the definition contained in article 1 , the United Kingdom 's ratification is subject to the understanding that none of its obligations under the Convention shall be treated as extending to the succession to , or possession and enjoyment of , the Throne , the peerage , titles of honour , social precedence or armorial bearings , or as extending to the affairs of religious denominations or orders or to the admission into or service in the Armed Forces of the Crown .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action is the sovereign right of every country , in accordance with its national laws and development priorities , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of its peoples and in conformity with universally recognized international human rights ,  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
TAKASU ( Controller ) emphasized that the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) were not intended to change the procedures governing the financing of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , but rather the aim was simply to increase the annual limit of $ 5 million established by General Assembly resolutions 48 / 229 and 50 / 217 .  NULLThe three categories of activities covered by those resolutions were presented in table 1 of the report .  
Whether its mandate is still required gives rise to the question posed in paragraph 25 of my report of 30 January 1996 ( S / 1996 / 65 ) : how does one measure the success of a preventive operation and judge that if it is reduced or withdrawn peace and stability will continue to hold , threats and tensions that have so far been contained will disappear and channels or institutions for defusing them will continue to be built or consolidated ? 
It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
It has since been determined that the list contained several apparent errors : it included an individual who had already been granted amnesty , a number of non-combatants , several elderly persons and at least one person who died some years ago .  
It was recognized that respect for the rights of the accused were fundamental and reflected the credibility of the Court and that there was already a large body of international law on the subject , as contained in such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and the statutes of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals , which should be elaborated in the statute .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The list of functionally defined , transferable fields contained in the Schedule is not exhaustive ; however , transfer of legislative and executive powers in fields other than those listed in the Schedule is subject to prior agreement between the Home Rule Authority and the central authorities of the realm .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
The Inspectors note that the questions raised and recommendations made in the report are similar in nature to those contained in the JIU report entitled " Staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) " ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 , annex ) which , although not referenced in the report , was welcomed by the Secretary-General as a valuable and timely contribution to both the planning and management aspects of field operations and approved by the General Assembly .  
In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
At the same time , recent scientific findings , as contained in the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , confirmed that the global climate was undergoing changes as a result of human activities and that it was increasingly urgent to take consistent precautionary action .  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
As for the ideas contained in the Perspective , his delegation agreed with the need for coordinated multilateral efforts to find adequate responses to modern global challenges , In its principal activity , namely , peacekeeping , the Organization should give more room to multidimensional peacekeeping operations , with special emphasis on their political and humanitarian components . 
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .  Part one had been completed in 1980 , and since then the Commission had concentrated on parts two and three .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
While different legal systems contained varying provisions concerning the validity of an arbitral award , no existing international instrument or customary practice envisaged the possibility that an arbitral award in an international dispute would not be implemented as a result of objections raised by one party to the dispute .  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Against this background , the preparation of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has to be welcomed as a major step forward at the international level in translating many of the recommendations contained in the above _ mentioned Council of Europe text , into binding internatonal norms , thus protecting children more effectively against the various forms of sexual exploitation .  Available for consultation with the Secretariat .  
This is a demonstration of our firm commitment to the principles contained in those instruments : multilateralism , the responsible utilization of renewable resources to ensure the continued availability of a valuable source of protein , employment for our people , the effective preservation of marine mammals and the use of science to protect a complex and delicate ecosystem .  
China is ready to work with the countries concerned in accordance with the established basic principles and legal regime , as contained in recognized international law and contemporary law of the sea including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to achieve an appropriate settlement of disputes through peaceful negotiations . 
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 5 ] to take into account the views expressed by Member States at its fiftieth session , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The delegation that had introduced a revised version of document A / AC . 252 / L . 2 ( A / AC . 252 / 1997 / WP . 10 and 12 ) as a result of the first round of discussions noted that the changes introduced in article 1 , paragraph 4 , contained an enlarged definition of armed forces that included the security forces and restricted the concept of other persons accompanying them to those who acted in support of the armed forces and were under their command and control .  
Five years have elapsed since we signed the historic Rio Declaration and agreed to a series of commitments , contained in Agenda 21 , on economic , social and environmental development .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Further , it should be emphasized that all allegations contained in the interim report had been transmitted to the Government during the course of 1996 by special rapporteurs and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights , including the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , on the question of torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to its prisons to non-governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
With regard to bilateral and multilateral treaties , the five States reported that they had signed a significant number of treaties concerning the protection of the environment , some of which contained penal provisions , and had implemented them in national legislation .  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
In addition to a general definition of certification authority , the revised definitional article should contain a definition of licensed , authorized or accredited certification authorities , which could be based on paragraph ( 1 ) of draft article B . As to the elements contained in paragraphs ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of the draft article , they should be reflected in the portion of the guide to enactment of the draft uniform rules corresponding to the definition of authorized certification authorities . 
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
At this meeting , the advance party informed the representatives that the Special Rapporteurs had found the clarifications and assurances contained in Note No . 57 / 97 unsatisfactory and that they would delay their arrival in Nigeria until they received assurances that they would be allowed to meet the detainees whose names had been transmitted to the Government in the note verbale from the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights dated 13 February 1997 .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Invites the Secretary _ General to request all States to submit their views and comments on the note and revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , and to prepare a report setting out such views and comments for submission to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ fourth session .  
He also noted that the Secretariat , as requested by the Subcommittee at its previous session in 1996 , had submitted a working paper entitled An analysis of the compatibility of the approach contained in the working paper entitled Some considerations concerning the utilization of the geostationary satellite orbit with the existing regulatory procedures of the International Telecommunication Union relating to the use of the geostationary orbit ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 205 ) .  
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
Gravely concerned at the persistent practices of the Israeli occupation forces in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , which constitute a violation of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as a grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the IVth Hague Convention of 1907 ,  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
The Council authorized the Commission and the Sub-Commission to examine information relevant to gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the communications listed by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 728 F ( XXVIII ) of 30 July 1959 , and further authorized the Commission to make a thorough study of situations which revealed a consistent pattern of violations of human rights ( see also paras . 36 _ 44 above ) . 
At its fortieth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1988 / 33 , decided to entrust Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k with a study of problems , policies and progressive measures relating to the more effective realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and recommended that the Special Rapporteur should take account of the guidelines and issues contained in resolution 1987 / 29 A of the Sub-Commission .  
At its forty-fourth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1992 / 29 , expressed its deep appreciation to the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , for his final report on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 202 to 246 of that report and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible distribution of the reports of the Special Rapporteur .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Despite the advances that have been registered in the processes of national reconstruction and development , on which I shall be submitting a separate report to the General Assembly pursuant to the request contained in Assembly resolution 50 / 58 C of 12 December 1995 , the technical and financial assistance of the international community remains necessary .  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
In this connection , the Special Representative and the troika stressed once again that it was imperative that UNITA provide credible data concerning the numbers and locations of armed elements under its control , and expressed their grave concern at the inaction of UNITA in fulfilling the demands contained in Security Council resolution 1118 ( 1997 ) and the presidential statement of 23 July .  
The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .  
Provision of $ 1,519,800 is made for the salaries of international civilian personnel based on the phased reduction of personnel as detailed in the table contained in paragraph 22 of the main report and annex IV and includes the provision of eight person / months for the completion of residual administrative tasks in New York by the Chief Finance Officer ( P-4 ) and one Field Service staff member beyond 31 December 1997 .  
UNCLOS is acknowledged to be an " umbrella convention " because most of its provisions , being of a general nature , can only be implemented through specific operative regulations to be contained in other international agreements or national law .  
The existing system already contained checks and balances that had largely proved successful , and extending the Court 's competence with respect to contentious matters to include disputes between States and international organizations would risk introducing too many divisive political factors into the work of the latter .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
In coming up with the recommendations contained in paragraph 79 ( d ) , the Panel benefited greatly from the presence of a Canadian expert among its members and through him received valuable inputs from the Canadian Government based on its extensive past experiences and lessons learnt in connection with the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
His delegation supported the recommendations contained in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the report concerning the continuing relevance and importance of the principle of a low per capita income adjustment , and it agreed to the Committee 's proposal that the future scale of assessments should be based on gross national product .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
Thus , he introduced Agenda Venezuela , which contained a comprehensive and coherent set of policies that include programmes of macroeconomic stabilization , institutional reforms , social benefits and productive restructuring .  
The third measure in the programme of action for implementing article VI of the NPT contained in the decision on principles and objectives relates to the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and eventually to eliminate them , and the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The Union also continues to attach great importance to the third and last measure of the action programme contained in the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , namely , the determined pursuit by nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons and to the desire of all States to work for general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the modest progress achieved in the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , as indicated by the figures contained in the corresponding chapter , although the progress is still manifestly insufficient to enable 65 per cent of the population of Equatorial Guinea to escape from the extreme poverty in which they are living .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
In its resolution 1996 / 64 of 23 April 1996 entitled " Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region " , the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and that they should reinforce universal human rights standards , as contained in international human rights instruments .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the International Civil Service Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] taking into account the views expressed by Member States at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
Although national legislation on the protection of the environment has been enacted in many countries , statutory provisions dealing with the protection of the environment were mostly spread through a whole array of legislation and regulations , mainly focusing on hazardous waste , water , soil and air pollution , trafficking in endangered species of flora and fauna , noise pollution and trafficking in nuclear substances , and contained in the various laws on these issues .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
The adoption of a protocol in respect of an instrument that contained civil and political , as well as economic , social and cultural human rights , would constitute an important step towards the actual realization of that principle .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Despite the condemnations contained in the resolutions of several United Nations bodies , Governments whose power is illegitimate , armed insurgent groups and Powers acting through covert operations have been responsible for the existence of mercenary activities , with a heavy toll on the peoples whose lives they affect .  
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
Regarding paragraphs 16 _ 21 , concerning what he calls guilt by association , the Government of Iraq wishes to emphasize that the allegations contained in these paragraphs are totally unfounded ; they are pure fabrications and biased accusations that are baseless , devoid of any material proof and intended to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national regime . 
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
The representative of the Netherlands felt that a provision for resource mobilization as proposed by the representative of South Africa should not include a reference to the single general domestic legislation clause , because it would be redundant and might set a bad precedent for the inclusion of similar restrictions in other provisions contained in the consolidated text .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,

Calls upon the Government of Cuba to carry out the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms into conformity with international law and applicable international human rights instruments and to end all violations of human rights including , in particular , the detention and imprisonment as well as harassment of and threats against human rights defenders and others who are engaged in the peaceful exercise of their rights , and to grant access to the prisons by non _ governmental humanitarian organizations and international humanitarian agencies ;  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted on 25 June 1993 , expressed grave concern about continuing human rights violations in all parts of the world in disregard of standards contained in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law and about the lack of sufficient and effective remedies for the victims ,  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .

UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
Progress has been made in incorporating the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development2 - including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , which embodies the important concept of and basis for international partnership ; the precautionary principle ; the polluter pays principle ; and the environmental impact assessment principle - in a variety of international and national legal instruments .

In the study , it was suggested that the most efficient technique for updating , under optimum conditions of speed and coverage , the definitions contained in all the different instruments inventoried in the survey conducted by CEFACT would appear to be the conclusion , at the initiative of UNCITRAL , of an interpretative agreement in simplified form for the purpose of specifying and supplementing the definitions of the terms signature , writing and document in all existing and future international instruments , irrespective of their legal status .  
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .

The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
The Commission invited the intergovernmental open-ended expert group for preparing draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption , established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55 / 61 , to take into consideration the observations contained in chapters III and IV of the report of the Commission on its tenth session in performing the functions assigned to it by the Assembly in its resolutions 55 / 61 and 55 / 188 .

Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
In this connection , the Consolidated List should continue to include previously collected data , while at the same time making distinct entries for those products covered in the interim prior informed consent procedure , in line with the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade , [ 3 ] and should consequently keep updating the information contained therein , in accordance with relevant action being taken by the Convention ;  
Recalling that the goals and targets in the economic , social and related fields contained in the Millennium Declaration [ 2 ] and the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits , supplemented by the outcomes of their reviews , constitute a comprehensive basis for actions at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
As regards interpretative declarations , the Special Rapporteur indicated that , in general , they were linked to a prior text , but was of the view that in cases where the declarations went beyond the obligations contained in the treaty , the declarations would become independent acts whereby a State could assume international commitments ; these interpretative declarations would thus be included among the unilateral acts falling within the scope of the topic .  
It was stated that the suggested draft articles contained some contradictory elements in that they posed intention as a primary criterion yet placed among the supplementary means of interpretation the main ways in which intention could be asserted in connection with a unilateral act , namely preparatory work and the circumstances at the time of the acts formulation .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .

He reaffirmed his countrys full support for the recommendations contained in the outcome documents of the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly , which had enhanced the international communitys awareness of the nature of the social and developmental problems facing the worlds peoples , particularly in developing and least developed countries .  
The report of the Secretary-General contained many useful proposals designed to strengthen the operational activities of the United Nations system , but it was important to ensure that the fundamental characteristics of those activities , namely their universal , voluntary and grant-based nature , as well as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries in a flexible and timely manner , were maintained .  
For this reason , we are not bound by such wording and concepts contained in that document which , therefore , shall not entail any political or legal consequences and do not oblige us to take any preventive , legislative , judicial , administrative , regulatory or other measures at the national level .  
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
The Convening Group of the Community of Democracies particular note of the observation of the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 33 of his report ( A / 56 / 499 ) on the issue that two international forums namely , the Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies play an important role in mobilizing the political will for advancing democratic values , principles and practices and ensuring that the lessons learned from democratization processes in various parts of the world will not be lost by future generations .  
In addition to the criteria set out above , the expert groups were required to take specific account of the indicators contained in the main existing sets of high-level indicators , unless there was an overriding technical reason for recommending an alternative .  
Within the main framework , indicators ( or very close equivalents ) that are contained in the major indicator sets ( MNSDS , UNDAF-common country assessment , international development goals , basic social services for all , millennium development goals and Commission on Sustainable Development ) are referenced to the sets to which they belong .  
Adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999,6 the text contained in the annex to the present decision as a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process , on the understanding that the preliminary agenda is of an indicative nature and will evolve during the substantive preparatory process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders ;  
At the national level , each LDC with the support of its development partners will promote implementation of the actions contained in the Programme of Action by translating them into specific measures within their national development framework and poverty eradication strategy , including , where they exist , Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers , common country assessments , and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework , and with the involvement of civil society , including the private sector , on the basis of a broad-based inclusive dialogue ;
