The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
Now , China 's ground telemetry stations and its telemetry ships at sea constitute a complete aerospace telemetry network for the boundless outer space .  They can accomplish the telemetry mission for various kinds of satellites and spacecraft .  China 's telemetry technology has reached the world 's advanced level , and China is capable of sharing telemetry resources with international networks .  
Bush said that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States signed with the Soviet Union in 1972 was " outdated , " and he discarded the defense policy based on mutual deterrence over the past 10 years , thus triggering off a new arms race by adding more and more offensive weapons to the defense system and expanding the weapon system to the outer space .  All this will inevitably aggravate the tense situation in the world .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
* Purchase " lap mei " with dry outer surface , naturally pinkish colour , and when cut across , they should look firm and shiny .  
The cable is made of steel wires covered by an inner conductor , dielectric outer conductor and sheath . If the cable is laid in shallow sea , it is armored , in deep sea , this is not necessary . The cables have repeater amplifiers attached at intervals of several nautical miles to boost the strength of signals .  
From the main outer doors which are hung with auspicious " spring couplets " and the protective presence of the door spirits , to the interior arrangement of such lucky omens as paper cuttings on the windows and vases bearing lovely peony flowers , symbols of wealth , the home is completely readied for the New Year .  
One of my favorite descriptions comes from " Eating Tangerines " by Li Kang of the Sung dynasty : Yellow gold the outer skin , the pulp a pearly white ; filled with nectar , storing deepa savor rich and ripe .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
Apart from sheer indulgence in the pleasure of painting , art also came to be moulded by a love of searching out the inner essence of things . Flower and bird painting entered the main stream of Northern Sung painting , and apart from pursuing detailed and accurate outer description it came to place even more emphasis on expression of the inner being of the subject . Lin Po-ting thinks that the portrayal of descriptive reality was just not enough for the Sung painters .  
Thus fate in Buddhism refers to action resulting from outer circumstances and to acting in accordance with one 's situation . People have to exist in the world of an unceasing cycle of creation and destruction , and it is only if one understands how to " go with life 's flow , " to face the illusory nature of human life , to be at peace with whatever fortune brings , and neither to hold tight nor cast away , that one can be contented in this inconstant world .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration . This is also the location along the trail with the finest vantage point . One can view from after the river bluffs of Lushui and look straight down upon the torrential Liwu River dropping down , the Central Cross Island Highway at its foot .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
The bizarre-looking relics in this room might just as well be aliens from outer space , so odd is their appearance . Where they come from , however , is Sanxingdui , where they lay buried for over 3,000 years ago in a land regarded by the people of the Yellow River region as a wilderness inhabited by uncivilized barbarians . This is another in a string of recent archeological discoveries which prove that the Yellow River culture was not the only source of Chinese civilization .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Take , for instance , Tuniu Elementary School in Shihkang , Taichung County . It has a sloping red roof ; exposed azure pipes ; blue , purple and yellow outer walls for the classroom buildings ; peach floors ; red and green stairwells ; dark blue pillars in the corridors ; green railings ; and picture windows that cover one-third of the walls . Vibrant color and striking moving lines are the dominant aesthetic . Paradise next to rice paddies  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
While these newer materials were easy to use and quick to apply , they constituted a heavy outer layer that caused the temple to lose its original , classical feel . Furthermore , these materials stifled the original wood so that the resulting build-up of humidity encouraged termite infestations .  
The outer surface of the skull of the left temple surrounding the gunshot wound of entry showed abundant soot deposits indicating that the end of the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the head at the time the shot was fired .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
Four enormous reinforced concrete pillars on each fa \ x { 84f7 } de of the peripheral and patio sides support immense inner and outer concrete ring beams running the full length of the building at the uppermost reach of the building .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
He suggested that it should be formulated as a draft resolution , for ultimate adoption by the General Assembly , entitled Draft principles governing the rational and equitable use of the geostationary orbit and arranged in the same way as the existing four sets of outer space principles adopted by the General Assembly .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
In cases where the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles , the coastal State , if it meets specific technical criteria , can establish the outer limits of the legal " continental shelf " up to 350 nautical miles from the baselines , or up to 100 nautical miles seaward of the 2,500-metre isobath , whichever is further seaward .  
The sediment thickness rule provides States the opportunity to optimize the extent of the outer continental shelf boundary and is intended to define the effective seaward limit of the sedimentary wedge derived from the land mass .

Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .

As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .

That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
In order for the UNISPACE III Conference to yield concrete results in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , sufficient consideration should be given to the planning of realistic and feasible follow-up activities that could be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the UNISPACE III Conference .  
Where the outer limits of the national jurisdiction of a State Party are defined by the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone , the United Nations shall provide to the Authority copies of such lists of geographical coordinates or , to the extent practicable , charts , indicating the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone of such State Party as may be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention .

Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
That delegation also expressed the view that adherence to the other , more recent international legal instruments governing outer space should be assessed taking into consideration the practical bearing of each specific instrument on different States .  
That delegation also expressed the view that accession to the other , more recent international legal instruments governing outer space should be assessed taking into consideration the practical bearing of each specific instrument on different States .  
For instance , technology for space _ based extra _ atmospheric lightweight kinetic projectiles developed in the cold war is being used to develop a Navy Area Defense System capable of intercepting targets in outer space at an altitude of 500 km .  
The mathematical model for the determination of outer limits from straight baselines on the surface of a geodetic reference ellipsoid is computationally more intensive than the method of envelopes of arcs .  
Full bathymetric models in three dimensions may be required in order to gain a spatial understanding of natural prolongation and may be essential in selecting the full extent of the 2,500 m isobath relevant to the determination of the 100 M outer limit .  
Article 76 , paragraph 7 , states that " the coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf . . . by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points . . . " .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the note by the Secretariat on the review of the status of the five international legal instruments governing outer space ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 210 and Add . 1 ) contained valuable analyses of and concrete proposals on the elimination of obstacles preventing the universal acceptance of the five international legal instruments governing outer space that warranted further consideration .  
The view was also expressed that the scientific and technical aspects of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be studied in order to develop further the legal issues involved , especially in relation to collisions between nuclear-powered objects and space debris .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .

The main principles agreed upon at that time were that international law , including the Charter of the United Nations , would be applicable to outer space and celestial bodies , and that outer space and celestial bodies were free for exploration and use by all States in conformity with international law and were not subject to national appropriation .  
It will continue to cooperate fully over the coming years , as it has done in connection with the preparations for this Conference , in order to ensure that the results achieved with regard to the main economic , social and cultural interests involved in the use of outer space can be applied for the benefit of all .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
It was recognized that the increasing number of international cooperative programmes in outer space required the continued harmonization of international intellectual property standards and legislation ;  
Recognizing the principal importance of providing prompt , reliable and affordable access to outer space on a non-discriminatory basis for the successful development of space activities , the promotion of the development of international cooperation in launch services is currently essential .  
While welcoming the many spectacular achievements in outer space and space-related activities , the President drew attention to the numerous social and economic challenges that continued to face humankind , particularly in developing countries .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the continental shelf on the seabed , drawn in accordance with paragraph 4 ( a ) ( i ) and ( ii ) , either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath , which is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres .  
The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf , where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured , by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points , defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude .  
The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding .  9 .  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf .  
Recognizes that such State may , notwithstanding the provisions of article 76 , establish the outer edge of its continental margin by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length connecting fixed points , defined by latitude and longitude , at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rock is not less than 1 kilometre ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .  
Representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and scientific institutions in the field of outer space participating in the conference had had an opportunity to exchange views and make constructive proposals on ways and means to strengthen the regime for the peaceful uses of outer space , develop international cooperation and increase the potential of States , especially developing countries , to use scientific achievements to promote the development process .  
The benefits of space exploration should not be available only to those countries which possessed advanced technology ; international cooperation in that area was required , first of all to meet the requirements of developing countries , since the appropriate use of outer space could open broad possibilities for ensuring the sustainable economic development of all countries .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
His country shared the view that the legal regime currently applicable to outer space could not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space , and it was therefore imperative to adopt new measures with adequate and effective verifying provisions .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .  
In order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , States Parties to the Treaty conducting activities in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , agree to inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as the public and the international scientific community , to the greatest extent feasible and practicable , of the nature , conduct , locations and results of such activities .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
Mr . Tarabanov ( Bulgaria ) stated that the treaty , as a legal instrument designed to stimulate international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful utilization of outer space , was a historic achievement ; it was not , however , an end in itself but a promising beginning . . . .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
To ensure that all users of space consider the possible consequences of their activities , whether ongoing or planned , before further irreversible actions take place affecting future utilization of near-Earth space or outer space , especially in areas such as astronomy , Earth observation and remote sensing , as well as global positioning and navigation systems , which have already become areas of concern because of the pollution of the electromagnetic spectrum ; Action should be taken :  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
China therefore opposed any monopoly or militarization of outer space and favoured increased international cooperation in outer space based on peaceful uses , equality , mutual benefit , mutual learning and shared development .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
It has to maintain a scientific community of the highest standard , promote a competitive space industry by maximizing its innovative potential and meet the growing needs of an increasing number of users of outer space .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
It believed that the existing legal regime was adequate to govern the exploration and uses of outer space , and that it would be practical for Member States , after having reviewed their domestic laws on outer space , to adhere to and apply the international legal instruments governing outer space .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing commercialization of space activities , it was necessary to identify improvements or mechanisms to strengthen the existing legal framework governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
The view was expressed that determining the legal regime on the basis of where the object was located , that is , in airspace or in outer space , would result in practical problems relating to the law applicable and that a unified legal regime should be applied in the case of aerospace objects as long as such a regime was complementary to air law and flight safety regulations for aircraft ;  
Further , except for certain ultra hazardous activities which are mostly the subject of special regulation , e.g . , in the nuclear field or in the context of activities in outer space , the risk that flows from an activity is primarily a function of the particular application , the specific context and the manner of operation .  
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting and expanding the exploration and use of outer space , as the province of all mankind , for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates . 
At UNISPACE III , it had presented a paper reflecting its interest in outer space , and it had established a Libyan Remote Sensing Centre , which participated in scientific and technical activities organized by regional and international institutions and cooperated with specialized institutions in other States .  
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
Within the framework of a comprehensive convention , complex issues such as the delimitation and definition of outer space , the monitoring of pollution by man-made debris , the regulation of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , the protection of intellectual property rights and the settlement of disputes could be resolved in a mutually acceptable manner .  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
The view was expressed that , in considering whether national or international air law was applicable to an aerospace object while it was in the airspace of another State , delegations should distinguish between objects passing through the airspace of foreign States for the sole purpose of entering or leaving outer space and those objects which would be capable of manoeuvring in and out of airspace and outer space .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
Wei Ziqing ( researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering ) : The use of satellite navigation is extremely widespread , from outer space to the land and sea , and from military and economic activities to our human and social lives , it reaches every trade and industry , e.g . , space navigation , determining satellite orbits , space surveys and mapping , weapons guidance , traffic and transportation , agriculture , forestry , and mining , geodetic surveys , and rescue and disaster relief , etc . 
Now , China 's ground telemetry stations and its telemetry ships at sea constitute a complete aerospace telemetry network for the boundless outer space .  They can accomplish the telemetry mission for various kinds of satellites and spacecraft .  China 's telemetry technology has reached the world 's advanced level , and China is capable of sharing telemetry resources with international networks .  
Bush said that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States signed with the Soviet Union in 1972 was " outdated , " and he discarded the defense policy based on mutual deterrence over the past 10 years , thus triggering off a new arms race by adding more and more offensive weapons to the defense system and expanding the weapon system to the outer space .  All this will inevitably aggravate the tense situation in the world .  
Nevertheless , following the gradual deepening of their understanding of the importance of space intelligence and information in the future and particularly in the face of the reality that United States has started to seize space superiority , many Russian military experts have in recent years held that the space of a battlefield of the 21st century will extend to the outer space and that a future war can be won only by occupying a place in the space .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
The 21st century is a century in which the cause of space will attain flourishing development .  Under the state 's overall planning and unified leadership , China will select limited objectives , effect breakthroughs at key points , actuate sustained development , and make still greater efforts to explore the peaceful uses of outer space for mankind .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .

The cable is made of steel wires covered by an inner conductor , dielectric outer conductor and sheath . If the cable is laid in shallow sea , it is armored , in deep sea , this is not necessary . The cables have repeater amplifiers attached at intervals of several nautical miles to boost the strength of signals .  
From the main outer doors which are hung with auspicious " spring couplets " and the protective presence of the door spirits , to the interior arrangement of such lucky omens as paper cuttings on the windows and vases bearing lovely peony flowers , symbols of wealth , the home is completely readied for the New Year .  
One of my favorite descriptions comes from " Eating Tangerines " by Li Kang of the Sung dynasty : Yellow gold the outer skin , the pulp a pearly white ; filled with nectar , storing deepa savor rich and ripe .  
Explains an experienced naval officer : " Because they are versatile and swift , they can get anywhere nearby within a very short period of time . Stationing them at outer islands increases combat strength throughout the seas around Taiwan . In combination with onshore missiles they amount to a formidable control over the Taiwan Straits . " Whenever there is a fourth-degree alert the missile speedboats are ordered to deploy to outer islands , and when the alert is raised to third-degree they disperse among military harbors , ready for combat at anytime .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
Apart from sheer indulgence in the pleasure of painting , art also came to be moulded by a love of searching out the inner essence of things . Flower and bird painting entered the main stream of Northern Sung painting , and apart from pursuing detailed and accurate outer description it came to place even more emphasis on expression of the inner being of the subject . Lin Po-ting thinks that the portrayal of descriptive reality was just not enough for the Sung painters .  
Thus fate in Buddhism refers to action resulting from outer circumstances and to acting in accordance with one 's situation . People have to exist in the world of an unceasing cycle of creation and destruction , and it is only if one understands how to " go with life 's flow , " to face the illusory nature of human life , to be at peace with whatever fortune brings , and neither to hold tight nor cast away , that one can be contented in this inconstant world .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration . This is also the location along the trail with the finest vantage point . One can view from after the river bluffs of Lushui and look straight down upon the torrential Liwu River dropping down , the Central Cross Island Highway at its foot .  
Under the mandate of discouraging nude dance as a form of worship , electronically animated mannequins appeared at one point as substitutes . But though the mannequins ' figures were no less shapely than real performers , and from time to time , they would un veil their gauzy outer garments , fakes , after all , were unable to invoke the same heated response .  
The circles that Tang Tang is drawing are not balloons that have floated in from outer space . They are hitching stones , frequently found in ancient ruins . The short lines inside the circles are grooves that people of antiquity carved with stone axes . Ropes or fishing nets were tied to these grooves for use in catching fish .  
The outer wall and major buildings of the compound are built of blocks of rough-hewn stone in irregular sizes , laid with a mortar mixed from malt sugar , glutinous rice flour and lime , and topped with roofs of heavy , stable red tiles .  
The bizarre-looking relics in this room might just as well be aliens from outer space , so odd is their appearance . Where they come from , however , is Sanxingdui , where they lay buried for over 3,000 years ago in a land regarded by the people of the Yellow River region as a wilderness inhabited by uncivilized barbarians . This is another in a string of recent archeological discoveries which prove that the Yellow River culture was not the only source of Chinese civilization .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
Late 1996 saw the launching of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite , which was built in a collaborative project between the European Space Agency and NASA . SOHO 's missions include studying the sun 's internal structure and outer atmosphere , and the solar wind . But satellite observations are immensely costly , and satellites have a limited service life and a high risk of failure .  
Take , for instance , Tuniu Elementary School in Shihkang , Taichung County . It has a sloping red roof ; exposed azure pipes ; blue , purple and yellow outer walls for the classroom buildings ; peach floors ; red and green stairwells ; dark blue pillars in the corridors ; green railings ; and picture windows that cover one-third of the walls . Vibrant color and striking moving lines are the dominant aesthetic . Paradise next to rice paddies  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Chen Chi-nan , a minister without portfolio who is a leading figure in the push for cultural and creative industries , says that from inside to outside there are three key layers to cultural production : at the core are the arts ( the fine arts , theater , music , literature and so forth ) ; the second circle includes advertising design , architecture , the media and so forth ; and the outer circle represents extended services and tourism-this is the most easily commercialized portion .  
While these newer materials were easy to use and quick to apply , they constituted a heavy outer layer that caused the temple to lose its original , classical feel . Furthermore , these materials stifled the original wood so that the resulting build-up of humidity encouraged termite infestations .  
The outer surface of the skull of the left temple surrounding the gunshot wound of entry showed abundant soot deposits indicating that the end of the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the head at the time the shot was fired .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The view was expressed that an international legal regime dealing with issues related to the dual use of military satellites and non-discriminatory access to the information obtained from such satellites should be elaborated and that such an instrument would promote the peaceful uses of outer space and the maintenance of outer space for peaceful purposes .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .

Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The most prominent of these is the elimination or consolidation of redundant paragraphs and the adoption of new language for operative paragraph 10 of last year 's resolution , namely resolution 50 / 69 , which has become operative paragraph 8 in the current draft , so as to urge all States taking interest in conducting activities in outer space to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , if any such negotiations take place outside the Conference on Disarmament . 
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The registration of aircraft , that has been provided for - as far as civil aircraft are concerned - in the 1944 Chicago Convention , and the registration of space objects that has been provided for in the 1975 Registration Convention which provides for any object launched into outer space ; both instruments establish different ways of , and requirements for registration ; Liability , which in the case of an aircraft is based on international treaties and partly on national law and is attributable to private persons .  
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared , the aerospace object flying in the airspace , especially in a certain State 's territorial airspace , is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law .  
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
He suggested that it should be formulated as a draft resolution , for ultimate adoption by the General Assembly , entitled Draft principles governing the rational and equitable use of the geostationary orbit and arranged in the same way as the existing four sets of outer space principles adopted by the General Assembly .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Although it was a body that could boast of noteworthy achievements over the previous 30 years in the preparation of legal instruments governing outer space , there seemed to be a current of opinion to the effect that it had now served its purpose , since future space activities would tend to be regulated by market forces .  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
In cases where the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles , the coastal State , if it meets specific technical criteria , can establish the outer limits of the legal " continental shelf " up to 350 nautical miles from the baselines , or up to 100 nautical miles seaward of the 2,500-metre isobath , whichever is further seaward .  
The sediment thickness rule provides States the opportunity to optimize the extent of the outer continental shelf boundary and is intended to define the effective seaward limit of the sedimentary wedge derived from the land mass .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
It was agreed that technical experts , including experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , should be invited to the fifteenth session of the Working Group , in 1998 , in order to identify and study the current international technical standards pertinent to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,

As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,

That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
In order for the UNISPACE III Conference to yield concrete results in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , sufficient consideration should be given to the planning of realistic and feasible follow-up activities that could be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the UNISPACE III Conference .  
Where the outer limits of the national jurisdiction of a State Party are defined by the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone , the United Nations shall provide to the Authority copies of such lists of geographical coordinates or , to the extent practicable , charts , indicating the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone of such State Party as may be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention .  
Where the outer limits of the national jurisdiction of a State Party are defined by the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone , the United Nations shall provide to the Authority copies of such lists of geographical coordinates or , to the extent practicable , charts , indicating the outer limit lines of the exclusive economic zone of such State Party as may be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention .  
Thailand 's space activities had developed in tandem with global space technology ; his delegation therefore appreciated the role played by COPUOS in strengthening international cooperation and norms for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , and fully supported the draft declaration on international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
That delegation also expressed the view that adherence to the other , more recent international legal instruments governing outer space should be assessed taking into consideration the practical bearing of each specific instrument on different States .  
That delegation also expressed the view that accession to the other , more recent international legal instruments governing outer space should be assessed taking into consideration the practical bearing of each specific instrument on different States .  
For instance , technology for space _ based extra _ atmospheric lightweight kinetic projectiles developed in the cold war is being used to develop a Navy Area Defense System capable of intercepting targets in outer space at an altitude of 500 km .  
The mathematical model for the determination of outer limits from straight baselines on the surface of a geodetic reference ellipsoid is computationally more intensive than the method of envelopes of arcs .  
Full bathymetric models in three dimensions may be required in order to gain a spatial understanding of natural prolongation and may be essential in selecting the full extent of the 2,500 m isobath relevant to the determination of the 100 M outer limit .  
Article 76 , paragraph 7 , states that " the coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf . . . by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points . . . " .  
We are therefore convinced of the need to address these issues linked with the risk of weaponization of outer space in the CD in a coherent manner and review those gaps and loopholes in existing legal instruments that need to be closed in order to preclude the possibility of military conflicts in , or including , outer space .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , it was not certain that the geostationary orbit required a sui generis regime .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the note by the Secretariat on the review of the status of the five international legal instruments governing outer space ( A / AC . 105 / C . 2 / L . 210 and Add . 1 ) contained valuable analyses of and concrete proposals on the elimination of obstacles preventing the universal acceptance of the five international legal instruments governing outer space that warranted further consideration .  
The view was also expressed that the scientific and technical aspects of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be studied in order to develop further the legal issues involved , especially in relation to collisions between nuclear-powered objects and space debris .  
The view was expressed that any legal principles of a possible future legal regime of the geostationary orbit , which was a part of outer space , should be consistent with the principles and rules of the Outer Space Treaty , which was the common legal framework for all activities in outer space and that , therefore , the future legal regime of the geostationary orbit should not be described in advance as a sui generis regime , since that status would depend on the rules and principles agreed upon .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and organization of space activities , the Legal Subcommittee needed to maintain its leading role in the development of legal principles and the identification of improvements to the existing legal principles and instruments governing the peaceful uses of outer space .

The main principles agreed upon at that time were that international law , including the Charter of the United Nations , would be applicable to outer space and celestial bodies , and that outer space and celestial bodies were free for exploration and use by all States in conformity with international law and were not subject to national appropriation .  
It will continue to cooperate fully over the coming years , as it has done in connection with the preparations for this Conference , in order to ensure that the results achieved with regard to the main economic , social and cultural interests involved in the use of outer space can be applied for the benefit of all .  
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
It was recognized that the increasing number of international cooperative programmes in outer space required the continued harmonization of international intellectual property standards and legislation ;  
Recognizing the principal importance of providing prompt , reliable and affordable access to outer space on a non-discriminatory basis for the successful development of space activities , the promotion of the development of international cooperation in launch services is currently essential .  
While welcoming the many spectacular achievements in outer space and space-related activities , the President drew attention to the numerous social and economic challenges that continued to face humankind , particularly in developing countries .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
The continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin , or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance .  
The fixed points comprising the line of the outer limits of the continental shelf on the seabed , drawn in accordance with paragraph 4 ( a ) ( i ) and ( ii ) , either shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured or shall not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath , which is a line connecting the depth of 2,500 metres .  
The coastal State shall delineate the outer limits of its continental shelf , where that shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured , by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length , connecting fixed points , defined by coordinates of latitude and longitude .  
The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding .  9 .  The coastal State shall deposit with the Secretary-General of the United Nations charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , permanently describing the outer limits of its continental shelf .  
Recognizes that such State may , notwithstanding the provisions of article 76 , establish the outer edge of its continental margin by straight lines not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length connecting fixed points , defined by latitude and longitude , at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rock is not less than 1 kilometre ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .  
Representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and scientific institutions in the field of outer space participating in the conference had had an opportunity to exchange views and make constructive proposals on ways and means to strengthen the regime for the peaceful uses of outer space , develop international cooperation and increase the potential of States , especially developing countries , to use scientific achievements to promote the development process .  
The benefits of space exploration should not be available only to those countries which possessed advanced technology ; international cooperation in that area was required , first of all to meet the requirements of developing countries , since the appropriate use of outer space could open broad possibilities for ensuring the sustainable economic development of all countries .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
His country shared the view that the legal regime currently applicable to outer space could not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space , and it was therefore imperative to adopt new measures with adequate and effective verifying provisions .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
The draft resolution is also silent on the current impasse in the Conference on Disarmament due to the inflexibility shown by a few delegations on the questions of nuclear disarmament and outer space , ignoring the express wishes of the vast majority of its members , which support the commencement of substantive negotiations as part of a balanced and comprehensive programme of work .  
In order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , States Parties to the Treaty conducting activities in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , agree to inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations as well as the public and the international scientific community , to the greatest extent feasible and practicable , of the nature , conduct , locations and results of such activities .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
Mr . Tarabanov ( Bulgaria ) stated that the treaty , as a legal instrument designed to stimulate international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful utilization of outer space , was a historic achievement ; it was not , however , an end in itself but a promising beginning . . . .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
As a result of such an agreement , the use of the natural resources of celestial bodies and outer space , which might relieve some of the immense pressures now facing mankind due to the limited resources of the Earth , could take place in a predominantly peaceful environment , in an orderly fashion , in accordance with international law , on the basis of international cooperation and mutual understanding and in accordance with previously agreed procedures . 
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
The Commission urges support , upon the request of the State concerned , for national efforts to gain greater access to resource information and to develop appropriate policies to facilitate the exploration and exploitation , with the States consent and in a manner consistent with the sustainability of marine living resources , of non-living marine resources within its exclusive economic zones , or to the outer limits of the continental shelf , wherever applicable .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
To ensure that all users of space consider the possible consequences of their activities , whether ongoing or planned , before further irreversible actions take place affecting future utilization of near-Earth space or outer space , especially in areas such as astronomy , Earth observation and remote sensing , as well as global positioning and navigation systems , which have already become areas of concern because of the pollution of the electromagnetic spectrum ; Action should be taken :  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
UNISPACE III had been the first global conference of the United Nations in which industry and civil society had participated as full partners of governments , reflecting the increasing economic use of outer space and the rapidly growing importance of private companies in that area as well as the heightened interest of citizens in matters relating to outer space .  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
China therefore opposed any monopoly or militarization of outer space and favoured increased international cooperation in outer space based on peaceful uses , equality , mutual benefit , mutual learning and shared development .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
It has to maintain a scientific community of the highest standard , promote a competitive space industry by maximizing its innovative potential and meet the growing needs of an increasing number of users of outer space .  
The Committee is concerned that the principle of nondiscrimination ( art . 2 ) is not fully implemented for children living in the outer islands and in poor urban communities , especially with regard to their access to adequate health and educational facilities .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee agreed that activities involving international cooperation , such as participation in international scientific campaigns , sharing of satellite data , providing educational and training assistance to other countries and building institutional capacity , should be further encouraged to enable outer space to be explored and used for peaceful purposes .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
It believed that the existing legal regime was adequate to govern the exploration and uses of outer space , and that it would be practical for Member States , after having reviewed their domestic laws on outer space , to adhere to and apply the international legal instruments governing outer space .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
The view was expressed that , although the provisions of the treaties were managing well with the increasingly complex activities of outer space , member States should focus on their domestic legal regimes in order to ensure that the provisions of the treaties were being properly implemented , including putting in place appropriate domestic regulatory mechanisms to ensure effective compliance .  
Some delegations expressed the view that , with the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing commercialization of space activities , it was necessary to identify improvements or mechanisms to strengthen the existing legal framework governing the peaceful uses of outer space .  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
The view was expressed that determining the legal regime on the basis of where the object was located , that is , in airspace or in outer space , would result in practical problems relating to the law applicable and that a unified legal regime should be applied in the case of aerospace objects as long as such a regime was complementary to air law and flight safety regulations for aircraft ;  
Further , except for certain ultra hazardous activities which are mostly the subject of special regulation , e.g . , in the nuclear field or in the context of activities in outer space , the risk that flows from an activity is primarily a function of the particular application , the specific context and the manner of operation .  
If we look seriously at the current situation prevailing in the way that outer space is used and other related developments in outer space , it would not be difficult to draw the conclusion that negotiating such an international legal instrument is not merely a necessity , but an urgent necessity in the field of multilateral arms control and disarmament . 
It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
We appeal once again to all countries to negotiate and conclude an international legal instrument on the prevention of the weaponization of and an arms race in outer space , based on strict compliance with existing multilateral and bilateral treaties and agreements applicable to outer space . 
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Deeply convinced of the common interest of mankind in promoting and expanding the exploration and use of outer space , as the province of all mankind , for peaceful purposes and in continuing efforts to extend to all States the benefits derived therefrom , and also of the importance of international cooperation in this field , for which the United Nations should continue to provide a focal point ,  
Recalling that international law set strict limits on the use of outer space for military purposes , she said that the issue of ways and means of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes should be studied in depth by all the bodies concerned within the context of their respective mandates . 
At UNISPACE III , it had presented a paper reflecting its interest in outer space , and it had established a Libyan Remote Sensing Centre , which participated in scientific and technical activities organized by regional and international institutions and cooperated with specialized institutions in other States .  
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
Within the framework of a comprehensive convention , complex issues such as the delimitation and definition of outer space , the monitoring of pollution by man-made debris , the regulation of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , the protection of intellectual property rights and the settlement of disputes could be resolved in a mutually acceptable manner .  
Consideration needed to be given to issues such as space debris , the status of low near-Earth orbits as a limited natural resource , the use of nuclear energy sources in outer space , intellectual property protection in respect of space vehicles , use of space technology and legal aspects of global navigation systems .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
The view was expressed that , in considering whether national or international air law was applicable to an aerospace object while it was in the airspace of another State , delegations should distinguish between objects passing through the airspace of foreign States for the sole purpose of entering or leaving outer space and those objects which would be capable of manoeuvring in and out of airspace and outer space .
