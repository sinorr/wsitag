It is on that continent that we find the greatest expression of the categorical need for renewed and strengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries in their efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary to lay the foundations for lasting political and social balance and to open new prospects of hope for their peoples .
