Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .

During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The " three protection line " system of ensuring the basic living of the furloughed staff and workers from state-owned enterprises , providing unemployment insurance , and ensuring minimum living standard for residents living in urban areas has been basically established and the social insurance system mainly focusing on basic pension insurance , unemployment insurance , and basic medical insurance for staff and workers living in cities and towns has been initially set up .

The work of " two assurances " continued to be strengthened , and a preliminary system of " three guarantees " for the basic livelihood of the workers of state-owned enterprises , unemployment insurance and minimum subsistence for urban residents was established .  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .

The key cities of people 's air-defense across the country have generally established an air-raid siren test system , formulated and improved urban air-defense plan , and strengthened the people 's air-defense command system .  Various localities have organized and trained a total of several hundred-thousand air-defense workers specialized in dealing with the aftermath of air-raid , and thus created a backbone force capable of performing air-defense task in wartime and the task of disaster control in peacetime .  
Since 1 November , Xiamen has stopped examining and approving farmers ' applications for building new houses and has listed the last batch of 19 administrative villages on the island in its urban residential and comprehensive quarters development plan , and this shows that it has established a new pattern of opening up and quickenedits pace of urbanization and modernization by a large margin . 
The requirements for the " two guarantees " work should be invariably fulfilled , and the principal leaders of the party committees and governments in various localities should continue to take charge of this work firmly and effectively , further enlarge the coverage of social insurance , tighten the fund collection and handover in accordance with the law , achieve the goal of granting old-age pensions by society at large in a comprehensive way , and quicken the tempo of improving and perfecting the system to provide basic living expenses for urban residents .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Beijing will give positive guidance to foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , in participating in the construction in such areas as new high-tech industries , modern service industry , urban infrastructure facilities , environmental protection , transformation of old , dangerous houses in the urban districts , as well as reorganization and transformation of state-owned enterprises .

On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
On the basis of economic development and social progress , it is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents , continuously raise the people 's living standards and life quality , and continuously enable the people to gain better and solid economic , political , and cultural benefits .

In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
On the afternoon of the 17th , Beijing Municipality held its first Mayoral Office meeting since the successful Olympics bid , where it studied the high-tech industrial development plan drawn up by the concerned departments for the " 10th Five Year Plan " and the three-year urban public transportation development plan .

We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
The great majority of people in these new social classes are playing an important role in promoting the scientific and technological progress of the country , activating our urban and rural markets , optimizing the allocation of resources , creating more jobs , meeting the diversified demands of our people , and boosting the development of the national economy .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
A series of policies and measures have been introduced , including increasing the issue of government bonds and suitably increasing money supply , boosting investment in infrastructure construction and the technical transformation of enterprises , guiding private investment , enlarging the scope of consumption and increasing consumer credit , boosting spending on housing and education , increasing peasants ' income through various channels , providing better social security to urban residents , increasing the income of functionaries , and improving the pay and conditions of retirees .  These have produced obvious results .  
China has a large population and vast territory , but its per capita output value is less than $ 800 , still a rather big gap from the world 's average level .  Hence , there is a considerably large development space , and the elevation of the urban and rural residents ' consumer structure will produce a prolonged and powerful pulling effect on the economic growth .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .

They have played an increasingly prominent role in grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , poverty relief , community development , spiritual civilization , and international exchanges and cooperation .

With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .

After removing the influence of price factors , the actual increase in income was 9.3 percent , a rate of growth higher than that for the gross domestic product .  
And last year , according to projections from a sample survey of rural and urban residents , less than five percent of wealthy people held nearly half of the nation 's private savings ( of a total national savings amount of over 600 billion yuan ) .  
The government is extremely concerned about the establishment and perfection of a system of social security .  Last year , a total of 2.81 million urban residents received a minimum living benefit , for a total value of 1.969 billion yuan over 667 cities and 138 counties nationwide .  
A year ago , the Hong Kong media extensively reported on the case of the involvement of Li Youwei 's children in land speculation , saying that Tian X Real Estate Development Company , run by his son , developed villas in Shenzhen Yinhu Holiday Village , which is part of the green area , and that officials responsible for land planning and urban construction granted the land to his son at a price 60 million yuan less than the fixed one .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .  
Its national economy is growing at an annual rate of 9.8 percent , the outlook of its urban and rural areas has improved remarkably , its comprehensive urban service functions are being constantly strengthened , the income of its residents has increased by leaps and bounds and its material and cultural life is becoming richer daily .  
The circular points out : Since the establishment of the national class-A soccer tournament system in 1994 , China has accelerated the socialization and industrialization of soccer matches .  The number of persons who have cared for and watched the soccer matches has unceasingly increased .  Soccer matches has become the component of the cultural life of the broad masses of people and the window of building socialist spiritual civilization in the urban areas .  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
Since the second half of 1998 , the Chinese government has successively issued additional 31 billion yuan of long-term treasury bonds for spending on infrastructure construction , increase of investment , and subsidies in the form of interest payment for technological transformation loans .  In the same period , it has formulated a taxation policy of encouraging investment and export , increased the income of the low-income urban residents by a comparatively big margin , and raised the wages of the staff and workers of institutions .  
At present , we must make continued efforts to guarantee basic living expenses for staff and workers , who have been laid off by the state-owned enterprises , and must pay in full amount and on schedule both the old-age pension to retired personnel and the minimum living expenses to the urban residents .  We should more rapidly build or refine our social security system ; should build both an unemployment insurance system and an old-age insurance system for the staff and workers ;  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
In 1999 , on the basis of the initial arrangement for issuing 50 billion yuan in government bonds , an additional 60 billion yuan in long-term bonds was issued , to be earmarked for boosting investments and interest discounts for technical reforms .  At the same time , tax revenue policies were also formulated to encourage investments and expand exports , increasing the income of low-income urban residents fairly significantly and raising the wages of workers in government offices and public institutions .  
Various policies such as raising the export tax rebate rate , starting to collect interest taxes , promoting steady tax-expense reforms , and raising the income of low income urban residents , etc . , have resulted in significant increases in exports during the first half of the year and in the total retail value of consumables , effectively stimulating consumer demand .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
In particular , the city should pay attention to depending on and applying new scientific and technological achievements to intensify the building of infrastructure , the development of energy resources , and building in an ecological environment .  The city should also vigorously plant trees and grass , endeavor to make its urban environment beautiful , enhance the level and efficiency of development and construction , and make sustained efforts to build itself into a major base that supports the development of Qaidam Basin .  
Therefore , experts have pointed out that , at this stage , China 's reform of the social security system will be modest and undertaken at several levels , moving at a steady but uneven pace and accepting some differences between the urban and rural areas , among different regions , and among different ownership systems .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
He said that in recent years , Shandong 's urban and rural outlook has changed dramatically , its economic construction has been impressive , and its people 's lives have clearly improved .  The province 's social undertakings have made comprehensive development , and its party construction has been strengthened .  
With the coming of the new century , China will enter a new development stage of comprehensive construction of a comfortable society and accelerated progress toward socialist modernization , and urban development is also certain to enter a new period , moving in a direction in line with China 's national conditions .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , our government energetically pushed ahead with the reform of the endowment , unemployment , and medical insurance systems ; made a special point of safeguarding the basic livelihood of employees laid off from state enterprises and ensuring that the pensions for retired employees of enterprises be paid in full , on time ; and developed the " triple-safeguard system , " i.e . the subsistence guarantee system and unemployment insurance system for employees laid off from state enterprises and the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents .  
Those measures significantly strengthened the guarantee mechanism for the basic livelihood of low-income urban dwellers .  By the end of 1999 , the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents had been established in all cities at and above the prefectural level and the seats of county-level people 's governments nationwide .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .  
We should gradually establish and perfect the basic pension insurance system and basic medical insurance system for urban workers , the unemployment insurance system , and the system for ensuring minimum living necessities for urban residents , and speed up the formation of a social security system with a variety of fund sources , regulated security systems , and socialized management and services .  
There are big differences in the level of economic and market development in different regions of China , and in promoting urbanization we must base the effort on this actual condition , act in light of local conditions , and gradually form a realistic and rational urban setup .  We can not impose rigid uniformity .  
Leaders at all levels must unify their thinking and bring it in line with the spirit of the Central Committee , truly grasp the promotion of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system as a task of fundamental importance with a close bearing on the overall situation , see to it that people 's understanding , leadership and measures are in place and that work is carried out where it really matters .  
In view of the complicated and arduous nature of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system and the fact that the two reforms must be well-coordinated and carried out simultaneously , every province , autonomous region and city must assign one leading comrade to take charge of this work , coordinate all quarters concerned and promptly work out solutions to major contradictions and problems encountered in the course of reform .  
It is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection , conscientiously implement the relevant provisions and requirements of the Central Committee , adopt feasible measures in the light of local conditions , and complete the task of basically establishing a medical insurance system for urban workers before the end of this year as planned .  
In the wake of rural economic development , especially with the development of the non-agricultural sectors , those sectors that have attained the highest standard of development have begun to integrate into the urban economy at a faster pace .  This marks the beginning of the transition of the dual , urban-versus-rural , economy from a two-tier to a one-tier developmental pattern , indicating that the dual economy is beginning to merge into a unified economy .  
and attained attention-attracting accomplishments as follows : China has strategically changed the guiding concepts governing civil air defense .  China has simultaneously enhanced both civil air defense facilities and urban construction ; strengthened the security of key targets ;  
The local people 's governments at all levels should scientifically and rationally formulate a settlement plan in accordance with the principle of sharing national defense responsibilities in a balanced way and by taking into account the total number of demobilized servicemen , the total number of staff and workers , the economic results , the employment needs , and other factors concerned in the same year ; should take effective measures to carry out such a plan ; and should secure a first-time job for demobilized servicemen settled in the urban areas .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
Li Lanqing emphasized : The central policy for the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the reform of the medical and health system has been promulgated .  Various localities should seize the time to formulate concrete reform measures in accordance with local conditions and implement them accordingly .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .  
This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
This association has basically established organizations in urban and rural areas , at the grass roots , in industrial enterprises and institutions , and in places where the transient population is concentrated .  Most associations are capable of giving play to their roles in varying degrees .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
Today , people 's consumption in both urban and rural areas has changed from " satisfying the basic needs for food and clothing " to improving the quality of life and seeking all-round individual development .  
It has strengthened comprehensive construction and continuously improved the overall quality and emergency combat ability of officers and soldiers .  At present , Shanghai City has changed its overall air defense plan .  The scope of air defense has been expanded from a central urban area to the periphery of the city .  
Finally , Zhang Zuoji said that actively promoting reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban and township professionals is also an important content for perfecting the social insurance system .  We must advance in equal measure reform of both the medical insurance system and the medical agency and pharmaceutical commodity circulation system , guiding all localities to step up implementation of medical insurance system reform programs , truly strengthening basic management , and stable expanding coverage .  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
As the state-owned enterprise reform and structural readjustment move ahead due to intensified efforts and as our country 's old-age population grows at an accelerating pace , our country is bound to face a heavier task in guaranteeing basic livelihood for laid-off staff and workers or unemployed personnel and in guaranteeing proper social security for old people in urban areas as well .  Only by building or refining the " safety net " in terms of social security will we be able to maintain social stability ; promote social justice ;  
The completion of these projects will add to the cities 18.87 million-ton daily water supply capacity , 8.24 million-ton daily waste water treatment capacity , 31,317-ton solid waste treatment capacity , 7.8 million cubic meters daily gas supply capacity , and 1,585 kilometers of network of water supply and discharge and gas pipelines .  We have added another 1,308 kilometers of new urban roadways , built 21 bridges , and added 86.84 million square meters of heated space .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
Hubei will raise its level of urbanization by hastening the development and improvement of a " pyramid-style urban system " with Wuhan at the center , the five cities of Huangshi , Jingzhou , Yichang , Xiangfan and Shiyan serving as the backbone , a number of modern medium-sized cities serving as the foundation , and a large number of county-level cities and numerous small towns serving as links to spread and boost economic and social development in the whole province .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Beijing must fully take its past into consideration , base itself on the present situation and have the future in mind in its urban planning and development .  While making utmost efforts to protect local historical and cultural relics , it should strive to accelerate the transformation of the old city and strive to make the city more modernized .  
The fifth is to vigorously streamline the administrative structure and cut down the staff , and thoroughly change the practice of setting up institutions according to the principles of " industrial categories " and " departmental management " formed under the previous planned economic structure and try , as far as possible , to set up comprehensive institutions in charge of urban construction , transport , culture , and agriculture in light of the realities .  
Li Peng fully affirmed Guangdong 's major achievements in building material and spiritual civilization .  During the inspection tour , Li Peng had an informal discussion with relevant responsible comrades from the provincial people 's congress to solicit their opinions and suggestions on the NPC Standing Committee 's work report .  He also toured enterprises and neighborhoods to gain first-hand information on enterprise reform and urban construction , and to extend cordial greetings to manufacturing and office workers on the frontlines of production and management .  
In medium-sized and small cities and small towns , by developing various kinds of industrial zones producing local specialty products , we will actively induce and centralize township and town enterprises to establish processing , construction , and service industry with local special flavor .  We will use industrial centralization and development as a driving force to prompt rural population to migrate to urban areas in a reasonable and orderly manner .  
An ironic fact was that some local people even tried to " pick a bone from an egg " by taking advantage of Ma Ying-jeou 's visit to Hong Kong . They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
We should strive to maintain social stability by intensifying our efforts at the comprehensive improvement of public order in the urban and rural areas and strike hard at gangster forces and all kinds of unlawful practices and crimes .  
We have learned from our investigations that pollution in this region is mainly caused by urban sewage and the polluted water discharged by paper mills using straw pulp .  Therefore , so long as we can accelerate the construction of urban sewage treatment plants and intensify efforts in closing down large and small paper mills , the target of meeting the required water standard of Class III along the entire water-delivery line is totally attainable .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
They should see to a sound implementation of the relevant principles and policies adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council ; and ensure that both the minimum subsistence guarantee allowances for urban residents and the basic old-age pension for retirees can be issued at the scheduled time and in full amount without any delay , and ensure that the two kinds of pensions can increase in a rational way along with the country 's economic growth .  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .  It also calls for expanding employment , improving the social security system , optimizing the consumption environment , raising the quality of living , and resolving the food and clothing problems of those people who are still living in poverty .  
Wu Minghui said that an obvious feature of the current system of residence registration , which was developed under the planned economy , especially the system of the unified purchase and marketing of grain , is that it totally separates the urban population from the rural population .  The demarcation is very distinct .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
The basic old-age pension , basic medical care , and unemployment insurance for urban workers as well as the minimum subsistence guarantee system for urban residents will be further improved and perfected , and the registered unemployment rate in urban areas will be controlled below 5 percent .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
Third , the urban and rural structure will be adjusted , the process of urbanization will be advanced steadily and positively , the rate of urbanization in the whole province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
In the next five to 10 years , Guangxi will increase the number of cities , will strengthen the cities ' ability to gather various production factors and promote economic and social development in their surrounding areas .  The size of existing large and medium cities will be appropriately expanded .  The infrastructure facilities there will be improved and strengthened .  The level of urban planning , urban construction , and urban management will be further enhanced .  
At the same time , social funds will be absorbed to replenish the funds for constructing urban infrastructure facilities ; relevant industries will be guided to gather in cities ; urban residence management system will be consolidated and improved .  Relevant policies will be formulated intensively to promote the development of urbanization .

The Principal Environmental Protection Officer , Mr Pang Sik-wing said : " This air pollution level was observed at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represents the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
High level of nitrogen dioxide continued to be recorded at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represented the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
It has enhanced the oxidation of nitric oxide emitted from diesel vehicles into nitrogen dioxide .  It was accumulated in the busy urban roadside with heavy traffic and surrounded by tall buildings .  
The very high pollution level was localised and confined to busy urban streets with very heavy traffic and surrounded by high-rise buildings represented by the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
The conversion of a former illegal hawking and environmental hygiene black spot into a tidy sitting out area provides further proof that co-operation between government departments and private property management can tackle even the most intractable urban blight , a senior Home Affairs Department ( HAD ) official said today ( Saturday ) .  
Very high air pollution level would be localised and confined to busy urban streets with very heavy traffic and surrounded by high-rise buildings .  The general air pollution level would be in the " high " API band , with the forecast API ranging from 60 to 75 .  
" Forty-seven newly completed projects will also be commissioned for use as scheduled .  A series of eye-catching exhibitions and extensive cultural , sports and recreational activities will be launched .  The Department will also enhance its environmental hygiene work to prepare for the arrival of the new millennium , and will provide a pleasant urban environment for people to enjoy , " Miss Chung said .  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .

International speakers had been invited to Hong Kong to discuss what it means to be human and how human values are defined in the twenty-first century , together with the issues of our ( post ) information age , telecommunication and cybersphere , the anthropogenetic domain of built environment and material urban landscape , digital beings in a so-called post-human condition which humans have collectively created and inhabited .  
" Since this is also the first plan for the new millennium , five focus areas have been identified as the Authority 's highlights to be addressed in the coming years , " said a spokesman for the Authority . These five areas are enhancing building quality , meeting elderly housing demand , facilitating greater private sector participation , providing a wider choice for customers and contributing to urban renewal .  
The public , professionals and the property development sector also expressed strong support for a three-pronged approach in urban renewal , including the redevelopment of dilapidated buildings ; the rehabilitation of buildings requiring repairs ; and the preservation of buildings and areas of historical , cultural or architectural interest . 
This is examining the environmental , engineering , financial and operational aspects of alternative plans for the sewage system serving the main urban areas in order to make recommendations on the most sustainable way forward .  
Being a hilly city with a large population , Hong Kong has a substantial portion of its dense urban development on or near to steep hillsides .  Coupled with the torrential summer rainfall , the challenges that Hong Kong is facing with regard to slope safety , particularly the safety of nearby residents , are unique .  
But to stay ahead in the increasingly competitive global knowledge economy , we must continue to upgrade our education system , improve our living environment , beautify and green our city and speed up urban renewal , so that we not only have quality people , but also quality homes to meet rising expectations as society advances . 
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .

Mrs Ng stressed that the conceptual development option had been measured against a comprehensive set of criteria , ranging from land-use planning , urban design , landscape , heritage , social and economic issues to cost , transport and environmental considerations .  
The funded projects cover a wide spectrum including research into real-time bilateral teleoperation of internet based robotic systems , economic reforms and labour market transitions in urban China , studies on dendritic cell functions in chronic Chinese Hepatitis B patients , high performance non-lead piezoelectric single crystal materials , interactions of trace metals and macronutrients in marine plankton , etc .  
Both economic and urban development in Hong Kong made tremendous progress in the 1970s .  Being more affluent , amateur photographers could have more to spare on the improvement of their photographic equipment .  Artistic potential of photography was explored to the full in this period .  
This exhibition puts the light on the ubiquitous modern urban experience and reveals the specific schema of human , object and space .  Also , from the most intimate body to personal everyday life , the artists tend to be more interested in excavating kernels of individuality hidden in daily experience .  
" Recycling Cinema " is a continuation of Ellen Pau 's longstanding interest in exploring different ways to frame the spatial and temporal aspects of mobility and location in an urban context .  In her video series , she investigates the simple visual experience of viewing a coastal highway to contemplate the moods of the mind and the silent pathos of loneliness .  
With this in mind , the SAR Government has tasked itself with several priorities .  In terms of the software of our infrastructure , we have decided to push forward with educational reforms and to develop our human capital ; to promote innovation and technology amongst Hong Kong people and to encourage enterprises to move up the value chain ; to enhance environmental protection and urban renewal to better our living environment ; and to improve the business environment to attract investments .  
First introduced in 2000 by the Transport Department ( TD ) on a trial basis to improve the environment along some of Hong Kong 's most polluted urban areas , the pedestrian scheme has proven itself to be effective not only in improving the air quality but also in cutting down traffic accidents .

The length of time required for the 14 major development projects varies according to their nature . For example , China Steel 's third expansion project can be completed this year , yet only about five kilometers a year can be completed of the Taipei municipal rapid transit system , which will reach 100 kilometers in length , while the urban waste disposal project is an ongoing one .  
As to how to clean up the Tamsui River system , Premier Yu stated that his preliminary view is that the main sources of pollution of the Tamsui River system are pollution caused by urban domestic sewage , industrial waste water , and refuse dumped along the river banks .  
The method of controlling urban domestic sewage is to construct a modernized sewerage system that would collect sewage from buildings , transport it through sewage lines , treat it in treatment plants , and discharge it in a suitably selected location and which would prevent sewage that has not been treated appropriately from flowing into the river .  
The Sagely City is located in Talmage in California . It is far from urban areas , has no resplendent temple of gold and jade , no fancy buildings or ornamentation , and not even the weaving of wanderers generally to be found at Buddhist holy places . It is more like a quiet farm .  
The government hopes that overseas experts and consultants can work together with domestic construction firms and academic institutions from the viewpoints of urban planning , financing , and urban management in exploring the comprehensive utilization of space in the area and in determining urban design control , development methods for public and private lands , development organizations , implementation schedules , and the like in order to promote the comprehensive development of the entire area .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention . These newly planned community districts and zones will spring up everywhere and improve the quality of everyday existence . New edifices will include traditional Chinese architectural features , and space for outdoor activities will also be provided for the members of each community , such as playgrounds , parks , and gardens .  
A plan for the long-term development of Taiwan 's infrastructure has been outlined as follows : To solve the problem of the over-concentration of population in the cities , a mass rapid-transit system has been drawn up for six major urban zones : Taipei , Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung . The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
But with Taiwan 's soaring property prices and the headlong rush of urban development , can these old town houses , draped over Tanshui 's undulating topography on the traditional long rectangular plots so typical of this province , survive ? Some say yes , some no ; as yet we can not be sure .  
Those who are fed up with urban traffic congestion find that driving the east coast roads is a pleasure . On one side are verdant promontories , and on the other is blue sea . What could be nicer than winding you way through this colorful scenery , especially when there are no red lights along the way !  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The earliest Chinese urban plan , from the Zhou dynasty ( 1122 BC to 255 BC ) , states that cities should be square , have three gates on each side and nine main roads running parallel both horizontally and vertically , and provide key sites for various temples and a commercial district .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
Because chelonians are n't picky about their living conditions , with the exception of a few species such as the Indian star tortoise which has strict temperature requirements and often dies a year or two after being brought into captivity , most species of turtles resemble mutant ninja turtles and adapt quite well to sewers , which are designed to carry away urban pollutants . Turtles are tough .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department .

Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before .

" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
In the 1980s , a number of young directors joined Taiwan 's film community . They made a bold break with tradition and gave rise to a new wave in local film . After a harsh winnowing , only Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang remained , the former noted for his excellent grasp of Taiwanese imagery and the latter for his clinical depiction of the urban middle class .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .

Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper .

Though designated a " national production , " the TV series City Ladies , which was co-produced by Taiwan TV drama producer Wu Tsung-te and China International Television Corporation , has been put on hold for a year since it was finished because it depicts urban love stories .

In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking .

But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations .

These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families .

Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The objective is to contribute towards a better understanding of the conditions and trends in human settlements in the region and to support countries in establishing balanced and integrated human settlement systems , improving housing , infrastructure and services and instituting proper management of the urban process .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
Investment lending covers a considerable range of sectors ( industrial restructuring , energy and environment , roads and urban transport and the social sectors ) and aims at supporting private sector development via projects that can help remove bottlenecks , and at improving the efficiency of public sector investments .  
In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
Population growth , both on a national scale and on a more localized level ( such as urban migration ) ; the erosion of the family structure resulting in the deprivation of one of the best stabilizing elements in the lives of children ; and the erosion of societal and spiritual values which also adversely affects the judgements of parents , who may view the child as a factor of production or as an investment for economic reasons rather than an entity vested with substantive rights and inherent dignity , are other causes of the exploitation of children .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures .

In 1994-1995 , following the support provided in the area of health policy and planning as well as in definition of proposals for decentralized projects through bilaterals , WHO 's work focused on the following : definition of a post-war strategy for rehabilitation of the public health sector and sustained development ; definition of possible health-care financing alternative ; technical support and training of nationals in developing a health insurance scheme ; completing policy frameworks on resource allocation and urban health care ; and providing technical support in the areas of health insurance .  
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .

In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .

In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .

In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .

The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
The argument that the construction of a large housing complex in East Jerusalem a city that has been for many centuries , and is today more than ever , the most sensitive spot in the entire world is just a routine urban development project such as those being built in New York , Paris , Cairo , New Delhi or Bogota , is somewhat less than convincing to the international community .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .

It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable .

The reply further pointed out that labour rehabilitation is a compulsory re-education and reform measure taken to prevent and reduce crime and safeguard the social order , and by its nature is not a criminal punishment , and that it applies to urban persons whose habitual anti-social behaviour is incorrigible by other means or whose delinquency , though not so serious as to be deemed criminal , yet clearly transgresses against statutory interdictions and therefore qualified for rehabilitation .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable .

Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .

Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth .

The delegations also cited the report of the Secretary-General , which identified inadequate or unaffordable transport as factors contributing to excessive building and population congestion , causing deterioration of local environments , and noted that inadequate urban transport systems are also associated with increased incidence of accidents and adverse impacts on human health .  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .

The ultimate effect of the modern economic protection , that is regarded as a system , hinges on the questions whether the overall function of the system can be brought into full play and whether the system can provide various major economic targets with enough survival capacity , appropriate production capacity , and rapid after-war recovery capacity under the condition of high-tech wars .  Hence , the protection of economic targets has already developed from the protection of individual factories to the overall protection of urban and industrial sectors .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .

During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
The " three protection line " system of ensuring the basic living of the furloughed staff and workers from state-owned enterprises , providing unemployment insurance , and ensuring minimum living standard for residents living in urban areas has been basically established and the social insurance system mainly focusing on basic pension insurance , unemployment insurance , and basic medical insurance for staff and workers living in cities and towns has been initially set up .

After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .

The key cities of people 's air-defense across the country have generally established an air-raid siren test system , formulated and improved urban air-defense plan , and strengthened the people 's air-defense command system .  Various localities have organized and trained a total of several hundred-thousand air-defense workers specialized in dealing with the aftermath of air-raid , and thus created a backbone force capable of performing air-defense task in wartime and the task of disaster control in peacetime .  
Since 1 November , Xiamen has stopped examining and approving farmers ' applications for building new houses and has listed the last batch of 19 administrative villages on the island in its urban residential and comprehensive quarters development plan , and this shows that it has established a new pattern of opening up and quickenedits pace of urbanization and modernization by a large margin . 
The requirements for the " two guarantees " work should be invariably fulfilled , and the principal leaders of the party committees and governments in various localities should continue to take charge of this work firmly and effectively , further enlarge the coverage of social insurance , tighten the fund collection and handover in accordance with the law , achieve the goal of granting old-age pensions by society at large in a comprehensive way , and quicken the tempo of improving and perfecting the system to provide basic living expenses for urban residents .  
It firmly takes the steady improvement of the living standards , both material and cultural , of the urban and rural populations as the essential demand of socialism , the fundamental goal of economic development , and the meeting point of the effort to properly handle the relations among reform , development , and stability .  It gives priority to resolving the problems that are of widespread concern to the ordinary people ;  
Beijing will give positive guidance to foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , in participating in the construction in such areas as new high-tech industries , modern service industry , urban infrastructure facilities , environmental protection , transformation of old , dangerous houses in the urban districts , as well as reorganization and transformation of state-owned enterprises .

In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
On the afternoon of the 17th , Beijing Municipality held its first Mayoral Office meeting since the successful Olympics bid , where it studied the high-tech industrial development plan drawn up by the concerned departments for the " 10th Five Year Plan " and the three-year urban public transportation development plan .

The great majority of people in these new social classes are playing an important role in promoting the scientific and technological progress of the country , activating our urban and rural markets , optimizing the allocation of resources , creating more jobs , meeting the diversified demands of our people , and boosting the development of the national economy .  
However , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .  The genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .  
A series of policies and measures have been introduced , including increasing the issue of government bonds and suitably increasing money supply , boosting investment in infrastructure construction and the technical transformation of enterprises , guiding private investment , enlarging the scope of consumption and increasing consumer credit , boosting spending on housing and education , increasing peasants ' income through various channels , providing better social security to urban residents , increasing the income of functionaries , and improving the pay and conditions of retirees .  These have produced obvious results .  
China has a large population and vast territory , but its per capita output value is less than $ 800 , still a rather big gap from the world 's average level .  Hence , there is a considerably large development space , and the elevation of the urban and rural residents ' consumer structure will produce a prolonged and powerful pulling effect on the economic growth .  
Since reform and opening up , urban and rural residents have increased their incomes by a relatively big margin , the masses have obtained actual benefits but , on the whole , the people 's living standards are still low , the laid-off staff and workers in cities and towns are leading a relatively difficult life , and more than 30 million people have not resolved the food and clothing problem yet .  Therefore , long-term and painstaking efforts are still needed to enhance the people 's living standards .

With 10 percent of the global arable land , China has managed to meet the basic needs for food and clothing of its population , which is 22 percent of the global population .  The living standard of the urban and rural population is increasing steadily .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .

A year ago , the Hong Kong media extensively reported on the case of the involvement of Li Youwei 's children in land speculation , saying that Tian X Real Estate Development Company , run by his son , developed villas in Shenzhen Yinhu Holiday Village , which is part of the green area , and that officials responsible for land planning and urban construction granted the land to his son at a price 60 million yuan less than the fixed one .  
Third , the legal system for urban and rural planning is unsound and the plans drawn up are lacking in authority .  Some leading cadres have a weak legal concept .  They make decisions as they please and do not act according to plan .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
The party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are standing at the forefront of reform , development , and stability , have a direct link with the vast numbers of workers , peasants , and intellectuals , and directly assume the important tasks of carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies in the grass roots of the urban and rural areas , which has a direct bearing on the image of the party and government among the masses .

Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
Since the second half of 1998 , the Chinese government has successively issued additional 31 billion yuan of long-term treasury bonds for spending on infrastructure construction , increase of investment , and subsidies in the form of interest payment for technological transformation loans .  In the same period , it has formulated a taxation policy of encouraging investment and export , increased the income of the low-income urban residents by a comparatively big margin , and raised the wages of the staff and workers of institutions .  
At present , we must make continued efforts to guarantee basic living expenses for staff and workers , who have been laid off by the state-owned enterprises , and must pay in full amount and on schedule both the old-age pension to retired personnel and the minimum living expenses to the urban residents .  We should more rapidly build or refine our social security system ; should build both an unemployment insurance system and an old-age insurance system for the staff and workers ;  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
In 1999 , on the basis of the initial arrangement for issuing 50 billion yuan in government bonds , an additional 60 billion yuan in long-term bonds was issued , to be earmarked for boosting investments and interest discounts for technical reforms .  At the same time , tax revenue policies were also formulated to encourage investments and expand exports , increasing the income of low-income urban residents fairly significantly and raising the wages of workers in government offices and public institutions .  
Various policies such as raising the export tax rebate rate , starting to collect interest taxes , promoting steady tax-expense reforms , and raising the income of low income urban residents , etc . , have resulted in significant increases in exports during the first half of the year and in the total retail value of consumables , effectively stimulating consumer demand .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
Facts show that so long as people 's thinking and understanding are enhanced , the " double thinking " education will be warmly supported by the broad cadres and masses and be generally carried out in the vast urban and rural areas .  
We should persistently promote economic restructuring amid development and maintain a rapid development amid economic restructuring to comprehensively upgrade our industrial structure , raise the standards and economic efficiency of our agriculture , industry and service trade , make a rational readjustment of the distribution of productive forces , promote a coordinated development of local economy and a beneficial interaction between urban and rural economy , and achieve a sustainable development .  
In particular , the city should pay attention to depending on and applying new scientific and technological achievements to intensify the building of infrastructure , the development of energy resources , and building in an ecological environment .  The city should also vigorously plant trees and grass , endeavor to make its urban environment beautiful , enhance the level and efficiency of development and construction , and make sustained efforts to build itself into a major base that supports the development of Qaidam Basin .  
Therefore , experts have pointed out that , at this stage , China 's reform of the social security system will be modest and undertaken at several levels , moving at a steady but uneven pace and accepting some differences between the urban and rural areas , among different regions , and among different ownership systems .  
Ding Guangen said : Building civilized communities is urgently needed for enhancing the ideological and political work and building a spiritual civilization , for gearing up our urban construction and management , for improving the living environment of residents and safeguarding social and political stability , and for building close party-mass ties and consolidating the foundation of our party as a ruling party .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
He said that in recent years , Shandong 's urban and rural outlook has changed dramatically , its economic construction has been impressive , and its people 's lives have clearly improved .  The province 's social undertakings have made comprehensive development , and its party construction has been strengthened .  
With the coming of the new century , China will enter a new development stage of comprehensive construction of a comfortable society and accelerated progress toward socialist modernization , and urban development is also certain to enter a new period , moving in a direction in line with China 's national conditions .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , our government energetically pushed ahead with the reform of the endowment , unemployment , and medical insurance systems ; made a special point of safeguarding the basic livelihood of employees laid off from state enterprises and ensuring that the pensions for retired employees of enterprises be paid in full , on time ; and developed the " triple-safeguard system , " i.e . the subsistence guarantee system and unemployment insurance system for employees laid off from state enterprises and the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents .  
Those measures significantly strengthened the guarantee mechanism for the basic livelihood of low-income urban dwellers .  By the end of 1999 , the minimum livelihood guarantee system for urban residents had been established in all cities at and above the prefectural level and the seats of county-level people 's governments nationwide .  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .  
We should gradually establish and perfect the basic pension insurance system and basic medical insurance system for urban workers , the unemployment insurance system , and the system for ensuring minimum living necessities for urban residents , and speed up the formation of a social security system with a variety of fund sources , regulated security systems , and socialized management and services .  
There are big differences in the level of economic and market development in different regions of China , and in promoting urbanization we must base the effort on this actual condition , act in light of local conditions , and gradually form a realistic and rational urban setup .  We can not impose rigid uniformity .  
Leaders at all levels must unify their thinking and bring it in line with the spirit of the Central Committee , truly grasp the promotion of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system as a task of fundamental importance with a close bearing on the overall situation , see to it that people 's understanding , leadership and measures are in place and that work is carried out where it really matters .  
In view of the complicated and arduous nature of the reforms of the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the medical and health system and the fact that the two reforms must be well-coordinated and carried out simultaneously , every province , autonomous region and city must assign one leading comrade to take charge of this work , coordinate all quarters concerned and promptly work out solutions to major contradictions and problems encountered in the course of reform .  
It is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection , conscientiously implement the relevant provisions and requirements of the Central Committee , adopt feasible measures in the light of local conditions , and complete the task of basically establishing a medical insurance system for urban workers before the end of this year as planned .  
In the wake of rural economic development , especially with the development of the non-agricultural sectors , those sectors that have attained the highest standard of development have begun to integrate into the urban economy at a faster pace .  This marks the beginning of the transition of the dual , urban-versus-rural , economy from a two-tier to a one-tier developmental pattern , indicating that the dual economy is beginning to merge into a unified economy .  
and attained attention-attracting accomplishments as follows : China has strategically changed the guiding concepts governing civil air defense .  China has simultaneously enhanced both civil air defense facilities and urban construction ; strengthened the security of key targets ;  
The local people 's governments at all levels should scientifically and rationally formulate a settlement plan in accordance with the principle of sharing national defense responsibilities in a balanced way and by taking into account the total number of demobilized servicemen , the total number of staff and workers , the economic results , the employment needs , and other factors concerned in the same year ; should take effective measures to carry out such a plan ; and should secure a first-time job for demobilized servicemen settled in the urban areas .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
Li Lanqing emphasized : The central policy for the basic medical insurance system for urban workers and the reform of the medical and health system has been promulgated .  Various localities should seize the time to formulate concrete reform measures in accordance with local conditions and implement them accordingly .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .  
This will be conducive not only to improving the peasants ' living standards and stabilizing the situation in the rural areas but also to exploiting rural markets and bringing about a sound interaction between industry and agriculture and between the urban and rural economies and a coordinated development of all of them .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
This association has basically established organizations in urban and rural areas , at the grass roots , in industrial enterprises and institutions , and in places where the transient population is concentrated .  Most associations are capable of giving play to their roles in varying degrees .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
Today , people 's consumption in both urban and rural areas has changed from " satisfying the basic needs for food and clothing " to improving the quality of life and seeking all-round individual development .  
It has strengthened comprehensive construction and continuously improved the overall quality and emergency combat ability of officers and soldiers .  At present , Shanghai City has changed its overall air defense plan .  The scope of air defense has been expanded from a central urban area to the periphery of the city .  
Finally , Zhang Zuoji said that actively promoting reform of the basic medical insurance system for urban and township professionals is also an important content for perfecting the social insurance system .  We must advance in equal measure reform of both the medical insurance system and the medical agency and pharmaceutical commodity circulation system , guiding all localities to step up implementation of medical insurance system reform programs , truly strengthening basic management , and stable expanding coverage .  
Over the past few years , our country has made much headway in furthering a social security structural reform in light of such needs as developing a socialist market economy ; has preliminarily established a basic old-age security system , a basic medical security system , an unemployment security system for staff and workers of urban enterprises , and a minimum livelihood security system for urban residents ; and has laid down a basic framework for a social security system .  
As the state-owned enterprise reform and structural readjustment move ahead due to intensified efforts and as our country 's old-age population grows at an accelerating pace , our country is bound to face a heavier task in guaranteeing basic livelihood for laid-off staff and workers or unemployed personnel and in guaranteeing proper social security for old people in urban areas as well .  Only by building or refining the " safety net " in terms of social security will we be able to maintain social stability ; promote social justice ;  
The completion of these projects will add to the cities 18.87 million-ton daily water supply capacity , 8.24 million-ton daily waste water treatment capacity , 31,317-ton solid waste treatment capacity , 7.8 million cubic meters daily gas supply capacity , and 1,585 kilometers of network of water supply and discharge and gas pipelines .

China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
Hubei will raise its level of urbanization by hastening the development and improvement of a " pyramid-style urban system " with Wuhan at the center , the five cities of Huangshi , Jingzhou , Yichang , Xiangfan and Shiyan serving as the backbone , a number of modern medium-sized cities serving as the foundation , and a large number of county-level cities and numerous small towns serving as links to spread and boost economic and social development in the whole province .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Beijing must fully take its past into consideration , base itself on the present situation and have the future in mind in its urban planning and development .  While making utmost efforts to protect local historical and cultural relics , it should strive to accelerate the transformation of the old city and strive to make the city more modernized .  
The fifth is to vigorously streamline the administrative structure and cut down the staff , and thoroughly change the practice of setting up institutions according to the principles of " industrial categories " and " departmental management " formed under the previous planned economic structure and try , as far as possible , to set up comprehensive institutions in charge of urban construction , transport , culture , and agriculture in light of the realities .

In medium-sized and small cities and small towns , by developing various kinds of industrial zones producing local specialty products , we will actively induce and centralize township and town enterprises to establish processing , construction , and service industry with local special flavor .  We will use industrial centralization and development as a driving force to prompt rural population to migrate to urban areas in a reasonable and orderly manner .  
An ironic fact was that some local people even tried to " pick a bone from an egg " by taking advantage of Ma Ying-jeou 's visit to Hong Kong . They argued that the Hong Kong general public 's strong interest in Ma Ying-jeou 's visit was not derived from their concern about the motherland 's reunification and Hong Kong 's urban construction , but was derived from their interest in " seeing the mayor being elected democratically in Chinese society . "  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
We should strive to maintain social stability by intensifying our efforts at the comprehensive improvement of public order in the urban and rural areas and strike hard at gangster forces and all kinds of unlawful practices and crimes .  
We have learned from our investigations that pollution in this region is mainly caused by urban sewage and the polluted water discharged by paper mills using straw pulp .  Therefore , so long as we can accelerate the construction of urban sewage treatment plants and intensify efforts in closing down large and small paper mills , the target of meeting the required water standard of Class III along the entire water-delivery line is totally attainable .  
In urban areas , a sound old-age security system needs to be established , with basic old-age insurance , basic medical insurance , business insurance , social relief , social welfare , and mutual social aid as its major contents .  As for rural areas , they are required to carry out the work towards the aged mainly in the form of family-based old-age care ;  
They should see to a sound implementation of the relevant principles and policies adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council ; and ensure that both the minimum subsistence guarantee allowances for urban residents and the basic old-age pension for retirees can be issued at the scheduled time and in full amount without any delay , and ensure that the two kinds of pensions can increase in a rational way along with the country 's economic growth .  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
It calls for acting in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " attaching prime importance to resolving relevant issues related to people 's immediate interests , including striving to increase the incomes of urban and rural residents , especially low-income people in the urban areas and the incomes of peasants .  It also calls for expanding employment , improving the social security system , optimizing the consumption environment , raising the quality of living , and resolving the food and clothing problems of those people who are still living in poverty .  
Wu Minghui said that an obvious feature of the current system of residence registration , which was developed under the planned economy , especially the system of the unified purchase and marketing of grain , is that it totally separates the urban population from the rural population .  The demarcation is very distinct .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
The basic old-age pension , basic medical care , and unemployment insurance for urban workers as well as the minimum subsistence guarantee system for urban residents will be further improved and perfected , and the registered unemployment rate in urban areas will be controlled below 5 percent .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .

The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
In the past , refuse was invariably used for compost , burned or buried . Compost heaps have no place in an increasingly urban society , and open-air burning has been relinquished because of the air pollution it creates , but the growth of waste in a prosperous , industrialized nation is usually faster than that of the population .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers .

In particular , with population increasingly packed into urban areas , this creates new opportunities for communicable diseases to spread . " 2,000 Dead from Influenza : Looking back at the history of epidemic illnesses , in the era when medicines were still undeveloped and public hygiene was poor , all kinds of diseases spread by bacteria or virus posed an enormous threat to human life .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people .

Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
But with Taiwan 's soaring property prices and the headlong rush of urban development , can these old town houses , draped over Tanshui 's undulating topography on the traditional long rectangular plots so typical of this province , survive ? Some say yes , some no ; as yet we can not be sure .  
Those who are fed up with urban traffic congestion find that driving the east coast roads is a pleasure . On one side are verdant promontories , and on the other is blue sea . What could be nicer than winding you way through this colorful scenery , especially when there are no red lights along the way !  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The earliest Chinese urban plan , from the Zhou dynasty ( 1122 BC to 255 BC ) , states that cities should be square , have three gates on each side and nine main roads running parallel both horizontally and vertically , and provide key sites for various temples and a commercial district .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
Often many different crops are planted in a single small area ; small towns and large urban areas are not clearly defined and often are mixed together ; and there are rapid changes in construction . These make it difficult to interpret satellite images .  
Because chelonians are n't picky about their living conditions , with the exception of a few species such as the Indian star tortoise which has strict temperature requirements and often dies a year or two after being brought into captivity , most species of turtles resemble mutant ninja turtles and adapt quite well to sewers , which are designed to carry away urban pollutants . Turtles are tough .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
As the structure of families and communities changes , the old intimate relations where one would raise the young and care for the old amid the sounds of cocks crowing and dogs barking have been replaced by cold impersonal relations in the urban sea of concrete buildings . As a result , many women have been confined to live lonely lives in their communities .  
Chen Hao-yung of the NIPM says that once a virus develops into an urban virus it becomes very hard to eradicate . Viruses are very simple in structure , and as long as they have live cells to act as their hosts they can continue to reproduce . Hence cities , which have dense human populations and also harbor large numbers of rodents and other pests , are perfect breeding grounds for viruses .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
In the early years of the Republic of China , with constant fighting among the warlords , intellectuals wrote martial arts novels to amuse themselves , and magazine stories grew more and more decadent and extravagant , leading Lu Xun to describe them as " monstrous and evil at heart , and filled with descriptions of romance . " These works invited their urban readers to escape the painful realities of their lives .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
Hsichih is a typical example of rapid city development where urban planning failed to give sufficient attention to water resources , where cultivated hillside land was seriously reduced by construction of homes , and where sections of river in Nankang and Hsichih were reclaimed by being filled in and built upon . This latter process cut out bends of the lower sections of the Keelung River in Taipei City , straightening it without consideration to the drainage problems that would be created in upstream at Hsichih and Keelung .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
According to art academic Chiang Hsun , Impressionism , from which sorrow and suffering and even seriousness all seem to be absent , was a product of the first generation to enjoy the fruits of urban life following the industrial revolution . The painter Renoir was particularly fond of showing nudes posed amid nature , depicted with caressing strokes of the brush .  
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history . As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes-playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart-strings-are still common .  
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion . Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no-one has to worry about getting everything ready . For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year . A bittersweet evening  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
In the 1980s , a number of young directors joined Taiwan 's film community . They made a bold break with tradition and gave rise to a new wave in local film . After a harsh winnowing , only Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang remained , the former noted for his excellent grasp of Taiwanese imagery and the latter for his clinical depiction of the urban middle class .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
Outline : Some Amis who have come from Hualien and Taitung to seek work in the urban areas of northern Taiwan , but who can not forget their ways of living close to nature back home , have chanced to come together and settle on some unoccupied land behind Yuan Ze University in Chungli , Taoyuan County . Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
Though designated a " national production , " the TV series City Ladies , which was co-produced by Taiwan TV drama producer Wu Tsung-te and China International Television Corporation , has been put on hold for a year since it was finished because it depicts urban love stories . It was considered " too frivolous " to be broadcast during the party congress . Wu , worried that it will grow completely stale , has disregarded his mainland partner 's opposition and decided to air it in Taiwan first .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
In the nearly 60 years since the end of World War II , societies around the world have undergone breathtaking transformations . The tide of industrialization has carried hundreds of millions of rural youth away from the land to work in urban factories , bringing about the disintegration of the traditional multi-generational extended family . Without the cohesion and support of the clan , it is a tall order for these young people to build and maintain stable , happy , mutually reliant families .  
Fifty thousand people came to the just-completed Science Exhibition Center during the three days of the exhibition . Adults and children alike personally experienced all kinds of dynamic and static activities , including small-scale interactive simulations , inventions , camps for creative exchanges between urban and rural students , and forums on the process of creative practice .  
He cited examples such as Vienna , where a referendum was held to stop a downtown university from cutting down six trees , and Hawaii , the first place in the US to legislate to protect its urban foliage by passing a law that required permission to cut or move any tree over eight feet tall , whether in a private garden or a public park .  
These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families . " I 've even seen students who have sold sex on the Internet , and others who have been sexually abused in their own homes ! " says teacher Li Man-yun of Taipei 's Peicheng Junior High School . Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .  
The quality of building materials , the increased use of metal , cement , and plastic , and the uninspired colors , all make for a disorderly urban environment . No attempt is made to achieve a harmonious unity . Even on the drawing board , every building competes with every other building for attention .  
In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick . In the democratic era , citizens have formed a close relationship with public spaces , giving them a key role . Public spaces afford people the most immediate aesthetic awareness of their environment . "

This increase took place particularly in places close to the scene of intensified fighting and reflected the growing inability of both rural and urban populations to cope with the daily problems caused by the fighting , the collapse of social services and the unstable economic situation .  
Create and modify programmes and policies that recognize and strengthen women 's vital role in food security and provide paid and unpaid women producers , especially those involved in food production , such as farming , fishing and aquaculture , as well as urban enterprises , with equal access to appropriate technologies , transportation , extension services , marketing and credit facilities at the local and community levels ;  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
As a follow-up to the conclusions of the 1995 annual meeting , civic leaders will receive more training in the planning and design of social policies and a framework will be established for exchanges of information between mayors and entrepreneurs , incorporating operational information about investment projects in the participating cities , with a view to facilitating the creation of a market for strategic urban projects in Ibero-America .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
argument was not worth entertaining because the problems of the shelterless , the slum dwellers and the inhabitants of urban areas with deficient civic amenities were so severe and caused such acute human misery , that they needed to be addressed with the utmost urgency .  
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on the urban transport , communications and energy sectors , and particular attention should be devoted to environmental policies and programmes in the developing countries with a view to improving and developing sustainable transport and communications systems , bearing in mind the respective social , economic and environmental requirements of those countries .  
The report on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries ( A / 50 / 396 ) was valuable overall and responded generally to resolution 48 / 184 of 21 December 1993 ; however it lacked details on specific actions undertaken by United Nations bodies with respect to the role and needs of women living in poverty or the actions taken to improve social services in deprived urban areas .  
Faced with the rapid internationalization of organized crime and the rise in urban crime , violent crime and juvenile delinquency , every country was concerned with safety , which was essential for the sustained development of society .  
Social services have an essential role to play in preventing the abandonment of rural areas and in seeing to it that services are available where people live and during the accelerated development of large urban areas ; they must ensure the functioning of infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , built at high cost but threatened with collapse by a lack of will and of personnel able to maintain and manage them .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
In the past four years the economy recorded an average growth rate of 8.2 per cent , resulting in increased employment opportunities and significantly rising living standards in the country , primarily in urban areas , where private enterprises are flourishing , and in fertile rural areas , where farmers have better incentive to grow and market their produce .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
Our present objective is to achieve adequate shelter for all and especially for the deprived urban and rural poor through an enabling approach to the development and improvement of shelter that is environmentally sound .  
Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The sustainability of the global environment and human life will not be achieved unless , among other things , human settlements in both urban and rural areas are made economically buoyant , socially vibrant and environmentally sound , with full respect for cultural , religious and natural heritage and diversity .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
The raising costs of urban land and other factors prevent the poor and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from gaining access to suitable land , whose location does not pose economic , environmental or health risks to the residents because of its proximity to industrial facilities or susceptibility to natural disasters .  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
Threats and intimidation continued to be directed against individuals and entities working for the protection of human rights by CVDC members and former military commissioners in rural areas and by unidentified groups operating in urban areas .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
Changes in the structure of transportation systems to encourage modal shifting towards inherently more eco-efficient modes , such as rail and inland water for freight and increased urban mass-transit and high speed inter-city rail for passenger travel , would make a major contribution to reducing environmental problems but require a more complex set of policy interventions .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The objective is to contribute towards a better understanding of the conditions and trends in human settlements in the region and to support countries in establishing balanced and integrated human settlement systems , improving housing , infrastructure and services and instituting proper management of the urban process .  
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
In urban areas , it is the poor who most often are forced to live in dense squatter settlements characterized by unsanitary conditions , or near hazardous industrial plants .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
Investment lending covers a considerable range of sectors ( industrial restructuring , energy and environment , roads and urban transport and the social sectors ) and aims at supporting private sector development via projects that can help remove bottlenecks , and at improving the efficiency of public sector investments .  
In general , the urban renewal strategy has developed from solid and concentrated work in limited areas to more widespread work in which publicly subsidized urban renewal is used as a catalyst and locomotive and in which the affected owners and tenants are given a major say in the result .  
Population growth , both on a national scale and on a more localized level ( such as urban migration ) ; the erosion of the family structure resulting in the deprivation of one of the best stabilizing elements in the lives of children ; and the erosion of societal and spiritual values which also adversely affects the judgements of parents , who may view the child as a factor of production or as an investment for economic reasons rather than an entity vested with substantive rights and inherent dignity , are other causes of the exploitation of children .  
The programme is intended for poor people living in rural , urban and peri-urban areas and has the advantage of combining various components designed to mitigate the chief manifestations of poverty : underemployment and unemployment , lack of skills , and precarious living and environmental conditions . 
Following the visits of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a number of the country 's rural and urban areas , during which he noted the inhabitants ' difficult living conditions , the Select Ministerial Council decided to establish a national programme to remedy the situation in districts lacking basic infrastructures . 
Cancelled : ( ii ) compendium on human settlement-related interventions in the control of vector-borne diseases in urban areas ; ( iv ) strategies for environmentally sound energy management in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa ; and ( viii ) compendium of sustainable disposal techniques for septate and pit-latrine waste .  
In 1994-1995 , following the support provided in the area of health policy and planning as well as in definition of proposals for decentralized projects through bilaterals , WHO 's work focused on the following : definition of a post-war strategy for rehabilitation of the public health sector and sustained development ; definition of possible health-care financing alternative ; technical support and training of nationals in developing a health insurance scheme ; completing policy frameworks on resource allocation and urban health care ; and providing technical support in the areas of health insurance .  
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .

Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

The provision of finance for shelter and urban development has been constrained by the absence of an attractive investment climate , a negative regulatory environment , a narrow housing finance base and low levels of savings due to low disposal incomes .  
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
Among the challenges faced by Turkey in achieving women 's equality , the representative identified the disparities in status and opportunities for urban middle-class and rural women ; violence against women in the private domain ; a strengthening of the contribution of the media to the advancement of women , including through an increase in the number of female professionals in this area ; and the revision of educational materials , which continued to portray women in their traditional roles as mothers and wives .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Priority research5 should focus on : coastal areas where populations are growing rapidly and critical resources are being depleted at an accelerated rate , such as on highly urbanized coasts ; soil erosion and desertification , linked with inappropriate land-use practices often brought on by migration patterns ; water scarcity , and misuse and pollution of water resources in both rural and urban areas ; and deforestation resulting from inappropriate shifting cultivation patterns , fuelwood demands , and conversion of forests in upland areas to other uses , linked with demographic pressures among the poorest groups in society .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,

Educated women in the urban areas of northern Afghanistan expressed grave concern over the restrictive measures imposed on women by the Taliban movement , especially in large urban centres which had achieved a certain level of sophistication such as Kabul and Herat , where women have played a prominent role in the culture for centuries .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;

In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Rising inequality , both within and among countries , and the highly uneven translation of economic growth into equitable human development are causes for major concern for national policy makers and the international community as poverty and social exclusion manifest themselves in , and further exacerbate , crime , disease and urban decay .  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .

It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .

It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable .

The reply further pointed out that labour rehabilitation is a compulsory re-education and reform measure taken to prevent and reduce crime and safeguard the social order , and by its nature is not a criminal punishment , and that it applies to urban persons whose habitual anti-social behaviour is incorrigible by other means or whose delinquency , though not so serious as to be deemed criminal , yet clearly transgresses against statutory interdictions and therefore qualified for rehabilitation .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
The 102 visits to project sites by United Nations observers and the extensive information database collected monthly over the last two years by UNICEF and a collaborating partner indicate a shortage of funds under Phases I and II in the 15 governorates to cover the most urgent spare parts needed for all the 210 sophisticated urban and 1,200 rural water treatment plants and 10 sewage treatment plants and for immediate repair and maintenance of the large pipe network system ( both water and sewage ) in an urbanized society ( 70 per cent of the population ) .

Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .

Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth .
