It has been learned that , last year , Sichuan 's procuratorial organs focused on investigating economic criminal cases involving leading cadres at and above the county and departmental levels ' state-owned enterprises , and 122 leading cadres were found to have been involved in major cases , of which 97 were at the departmental or bureau level .  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
The book on the " expositions of Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin on Ideological and Political Work " should be regarded as the basic teaching materials , fitted into the theoretical study for party committees at and above the regimental level and into the political education for the PLA units , and included in the political theoretical classes and study of colleges and universities .  The people should be organized to conscientiously study it .  Leading cadres , especially political cadres , should take the lead in studying and understanding these expositions well .  
Consumer demand is short for three main reasons : 1 .  Since reform and opening , while the absolute value of the income and consumption level of Chinese residents has been growing steadily , the ratio of our society 's gross product that is eventually used for consumption , or the final consumption rate , has been in a falling trend , with our accumulation or savings rate having tended to rise .  
It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
The import of advanced technology and varieties such as mechanized stockraising , enclosed fish-rearing , the processing , storage , and preserving of agricultural produce , foodstuff processing , covering young plants with plastic film , and introduction of fine seed strains has markedly enhanced the level of modernization of China 's agriculture and grain production .  
He stressed : Conducting the " Three Stresses " education at the county and city level is of great significance , because in our party 's organizational structure and the structure of state power , counties and cities are both leading organizations and basic units .  They play a pivotal role in forming a link between the provincial and central authorities on the one hand and the countryside , including townships and towns , on the other hand .  
Because the leadership posts at the county and city level are also schools to foster outstanding leadership talent , and because counties and cities have complete functions just as " the sparrow may be small but it has all the vital organs , " the posts are the most suitable places to temper cadres ; a considerable number of senior and medium-level leading cadres have grown to maturity after being tempered at such posts .  
For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
First of all , state-owned and state-holding enterprises realized a total profit of 96.7-billion yuan in 1999 , up by 77.7 percent on comparable items which represented the best level ever achieved since 1995 when the contract system was put to an end and the system of tax distribution was introduced .

and the major measures should conform to such requirements as strengthening macro-economic control and regulation , readjusting the structure of the economy , making sound arrangements for the state 's key constructions , taking earnest steps to improve the living standards of the people , enhancing the level of employment , providing sound social securities , and bringing about a sustainable growth . "  
The rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .

Wu Yi said : In recent years , with the direct efforts of leaders of the two countries , relations between China and Russia have maintained a steady , healthy and satisfactory trend .  The level of strategic cooperation has been raised steadily with notable results .

Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
A correct evaluation of the nature of growth in the economic returns of Liaoning �s state-owned industries will have a direct bearing on the choice of policy decisions for the next step of the reform of SOEs in Liaoning and even the whole nation .  The policy-making level in Liaoning Province has a sober understanding of this issue .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .  The per capita GDP of the province in 2005 will reach the national average level in 2000 ; and will catch up with the national average level in 2010 , thus becoming an economically strong province in the western region .  
The glorious achievements we have made and the tortuous road we have gone through have proven , from positive and negative sides , that our use of scientific theory as guidance , our use of subjective reality as basis , and the continuous elevation of the Party 's level in policy theories and its ability to master the whole , are very important for the rise and fall of our cause .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .  With the exception of an extremely small number of complicated diseases that need more researches and studies to overcome them , common diseases can be cured by proper treatment .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
The small enterprises should take the road of being " specialized , refined , and unique , " establish their own competitive superiority , set up close ties of cooperation with the large enterprises , and heighten their level of socialized production .  
We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
It is even more important that in the 50 years since the founding of New China , particularly since the start of reform and opening up , the overall strength of our country has been remarkably enhanced , the people 's living standard is approaching a better-off level of moderate prosperity , and we have had a sufficient economic strength to increase our support to the Central Western Region ;  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .

In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .

In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .

The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .

On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
In light of the " three represents " requirements , party committees at and above the army level fully recognized the extremely great importance of changing the leadership style and getting involved with the masses .  They paid special attention to overcoming superficial work style , formalism , and failure to go down to the grassroots , stay there , and provide concrete assistance to the masses .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
in our country , social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and the people 's living standards were all raised to a higher and higher level ; gratifying reports came from all fronts ; our nation 's international status was obviously enhanced .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
For example , last year , when discussing the measures for promoting community construction and management , advancing the construction of new and high-tech industrial bases , and reinforcing the party organizations at the grass-roots level , members of the municipal party committee standing committee were dispatched to do special investigations and research in the fields they took charge of .  This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .  Only by continuously improving itself , and making efforts to improve the mode of its leadership , can a local party committee really ascent a higher plain to look farther ahead and give thought to things more deeply ; and only thus can it better play a role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
On 29 June , Wang Han-ning , " deputy chief of staff and concurrently executive officer " , further pointed out at a news conference : The " Han Kuang-16 exercise " scheduled for mid-August is an annual training program which is directed at a possible enemy " attack on Taiwan " ; it is divided into three main parts : deduction from chessmen maneuvers ; simulated chessmen at and above battalion level in the combat theater , together with drills by a number of actual troops ;  
Participants unanimously held that Chairman Jiang viewed military logistical building in a new era from the angle of time and strategy , applied Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's ideology on military logistical building , scientifically analyzed new contradictions and problems in logistical work under a new situation , and guided the military to great progress in logistical adjustment and reform by integrating theory with reality .  As a result , the level of our logistical building has been raised markedly and a new trail for military logistical building with a Chinese characteristic has been blazed .  
Recently , this reporter went to a place in Hebei for assignment .  Arriving at the office of the county government , this reporter explained the intent of investigating and understanding some conditions reported by farmers .  The director of the county government office who received this reporter let out a long heavy sigh and said : " In recent years , our organizations at the grass-roots level have been weak .  The cadres dare not speak or take any actions .  The farmers are spoiled as a result . "  
They are satisfied only with their selfish desire and small farmer 's mentality .  They merely keep a close watch on the little bit of interests before their eyes , and set themselves against cadres .  It is outright impossible to carry forward undertakings at the grass-roots level . "  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
This is aimed at helping party organizations further check , understand , and use cadres , discover and assist incompetent cadres , and make adjustments at an earlier stage .  Since August 1995 , Qingdao has implemented a probation system to place all newly selected and appointed leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level on probation .  The probation period is one year .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
In order to realize this goal , we must conform to the requirements of " low level and wide coverage " and adhere to the principle of associating individual accounts with comprehensive coordination in society .  Employers and employees should share the expense for medical insurance at a reasonable rate .  On this basis , we must balance the rights and obligations of the insured , ensure the collection of premiums for medical insurance and probe for solutions to balance medical costs that exceed the maximum sum .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
Compared to the same period last year , among the 14 key industries , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronics , light industry , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries saw their profits increased and the power industry maintained a relatively high level of profitability .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
The scale of these building activities is large , and they have broad impact .  They have raised the level of civilization in the cities and the ethical quality of the citizens and played a positive promotional role for the stability of reform and development .  
Cadres at the detachment level are required to master the knowledge and the command skills on more than three arms of the services within the scope of the brigade , and to meet the requirement of " being proficient in the professional work on their own posts , getting to know the work on nearby posts , and gaining an intimate knowledge of the work on related posts " ;  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
To effectively solve this problem , the division has conducted research on simulated high-plateau oxygen-deficient training in light of training troops with science and technology in recent years , and has summed up a complete set of methods for physical training .  As a result , routine training has basically produced the actual results of similar training in places over 4,500 m above the sea level , where only half of the normal oxygen content is in the air .  
Besides , the armored units , the missile units , and other heavy equipment formed organic units to take part in the training for the first time in places over 5,000 m above the sea level on an average in the hinterland of the Kalakunlun Shan . The troops were tempered and their combat capability on plateaus under conditions similar to those of an actual combat was increased .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
It is party leaders who drew up the armed forces ' laws and regulations .  They have shaped and standardized the party 's basic principles for the construction of the armed forces , elevated these principles to the level where they become the will of the state , and used mandatory authority to ensure their implementation .  This is specifically an expression of consolidating and strengthening the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China . The US media have the habit of exposing the negative aspects of China , not reporting or reporting less on the positive ones , because the United States still has the arrogant complex of being a big country .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with . 
seriously implement the general requirements that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily and must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support , and comprehensively promote army building ; resolutely abandon formalism and bureaucracy , make great efforts to encourage the style of seeking truth , doing solid work and going deep into reality , properly grasp all aspects of work , and constantly raise the revolutionization , modernization , and regularization of the armed forces to a new level .  
The number of leading cadres at prefectural and city ( departmental and bureau ) level that received regular legal training topped 176,000 .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
Zhang Shiming , who has been engaged in long-term research on innovative utilization of straw , believes that it is still necessary at present to accelerate the implementation of strengthening the country through science and education , the development of science , and increasing the scientific level of the entire nation .  In this way , it will enable the broad masses of the people to enhance their abilities to ward off the disturbance and destruction caused by the evil cult organization of " Falungong " .  
With the rapid development in the equipment and technical level of the Chinese armored unit , the new generation of the officers and men of the " heroic " tank unit are aiming for the frontier of the world 's high technology .  They , guided by actual combat requirements and relying on existing equipment potentials , have successfully revamped the Chinese army 's first digital tank .  
At present , momentous economic globalization and new technology revolution have raised the economy of mankind to a higher level , and has also provided a rare opportunity for our country 's economy to reach the world advanced level .  On the other hand , with 50 years of accumulation and , especially , development of the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , we have acquired favorable conditions for accelerated development , in both objective and subjective terms .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .  But some institutions above the level of division still adhere to traditional practices and outdated ways of thinking .  They believe that only when they promote a certain number of activities can they receive wide attention and only when they hold a certain number of meetings can they show their great concern .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .  Through 34 hours of hard efforts , the battalion successfully completed its task without harm to a single soldier .  It has demonstrated the high technological and tactical level of anti-chemical warfare troops and their indomitable style and fearless spirit .  
In additional to the meeting between leaders of the highest level of China and the DPRK , our party has continued to maintain high-level contacts with the Vietnamese and the Laos parties .  We also organized two important theoretical discussion activities with the Vietnamese parties , which contributed to improving friendly relations between the ruling parties of the socialist countries .  
Now , China 's ground telemetry stations and its telemetry ships at sea constitute a complete aerospace telemetry network for the boundless outer space .  They can accomplish the telemetry mission for various kinds of satellites and spacecraft .  China 's telemetry technology has reached the world 's advanced level , and China is capable of sharing telemetry resources with international networks .  
At present , China 's social security system is still not sufficiently perfect , the problems of unitary channel for raising social insurance funds , relatively narrow coverage , imperfect rules and regulations , and insufficiently standardized management still exist , and there are also problems in some localities where the " two guarantees " can not be completely put into effect because both funds and work have not come to the required level .  
From an overall perspective , China faces a good domestic and international environment for the development of foreign economic relations and trade next year ; global trade is expected to maintain a certain level of growth , and China 's domestic economy will continue to maintain fairly rapid growth .  
Since the realization of socialism mostly started based on a relatively low level of economic development , in order to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people , we must rapidly transform the backward condition of social productive forces : in a situation where the two systems , socialist and capitalist , coexist , we also need to energetically develop productive forces to give expression to socialism 's superiority .  
The minimum term of office for some ranks has been shortened and the conditions for early promotion and promotion by more than one grade at a time have been moderately relaxed .  The maximum term of office for officers ranking at and above the division level has been fixed , creating conditions for making promotion and demotion easier and for selecting and bring up outstanding young cadres .  
The minimum length of service of officers in peacetime has been stipulated and the upper age limit for the active service of officers ranking at the level of principal regiment commander has been relaxed , so as to give better play to the role of talent and improve the stability of the officer contingent .

Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .

Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?

Feasible and effective measures should be adopted according to the specific conditions of various areas and industries .  Priority should be given to the central and western regions of the country , the main grain producing areas , and areas where peasants ' income remain at a low level .  It is necessary to stop the downward tendency in peasants ' income as soon as possible .  
Hubei will raise its level of urbanization by hastening the development and improvement of a " pyramid-style urban system " with Wuhan at the center , the five cities of Huangshi , Jingzhou , Yichang , Xiangfan and Shiyan serving as the backbone , a number of modern medium-sized cities serving as the foundation , and a large number of county-level cities and numerous small towns serving as links to spread and boost economic and social development in the whole province .  
In the future , the leading bodies of branch offices at and below the provincial level are allowed to select and employ qualified people from the entire society for all their leading posts that are suited for open recruitment .  
He pointed out that the year 2001 is the first year for implementing the 10th Five-year Plan in our country .  We must put making great efforts to promote structural readjustment in a prominent position , speed up industrial reorganization and transformation as well as the optimization and upgrading of structure by firmly depending on reform at a deeper level and technical progress , and strive to make considerable and substantive progress in several fundamental aspects and aspects that have a bearing on the overall situation in several years .

A comparatively feasible way is to do something on the denominator of the stock market profit rate equation .  In other words , the internal reform of stock companies should be intensified , their business results improved , and their profit making ability enhanced , so that stock market profit rates will return to a comparatively rational level .  
Xiang Huaicheng said that compared with other constantly developing regional cooperation organization , especially the European economic and monetary union , differences between Asian countries still exist in terms of history , culture , political system , and the level of economic development , and diversification is an conspicuous problem .  This determines that East Asia cooperation is a long-term arduous task .  It is necessary to choose the way and road for cooperation in light of its own characteristics , and the mode of development of other regional cooperation organizations should not be copied mechanically .  
Besides , the " digital gap " resulted from the rapid development of the modern information technology is further increasing the gap between the developing countries and the developed ones in terms of the level of income and the level of development .  Some developing countries are being pushed farther to the brink [ bi jin yi bu bian yuan hua ] .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
Authoritative figures point out that tariff concessions are a basic obligation on WTO members ; on the basis of mutual benefit and concession , these are aimed at lowering the general level of important and export tariffs , and in particular reducing high tariffs hampering imports , and also at setting the maximum tariffs for certain commodities , that is , constraining tariff rates and not levying tariffs in excess of those limits , so as to promote the free development of international trade .

Net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to growth by 1.3 trillion yuan , about the same level as last year .  
The ninth five-year plan was smoothly completed ; social productive forces and comprehensive national strength have risen to a new level ;  
According to an insider , the CPC top level has decided that the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Public Security must go all-out to deal with Falungong and regard it as the current greatest hostile force threatening state security and social stability .  In addition , in its crackdown on Falungong , the Ministry of State Security will play the main role , instead of an assistant as before , thus showing that Falungong is regarded as the no . 1 enemy of the state and that the crackdown will escalate .  
Before the Spring Festival , in order to have the " study and education " activities aim at more definite objectives , the provincial party committee enlisted 20 cadres at the provincial level , 291 cadres at the prefectural and departmental levels , and 10,686 cadres at the county and section levels to go down to the grassroots units to conduct investigation and study , trying to feel out the mental conditions of the objects for the " study and education " activities and the conspicuous problems that must be resolved .  
In particular , having developed the spirit of defying strong opponents and putting up an indomitable fight , the Chinese good athletes obtained remarkable results in the 27th Olympic Games , which has fully demonstrated the level of China 's athletic competition and the fine mental features of the Chinese people in the era of reform and opening up .  
In the training and management of the athletes , serious attention should be paid to scientifically training their abilities in physique and athletic contests , and heightening their cultural level , mental quality , and moral standard ;  
Moreover , we should base ourselves on China 's realities and conscientiously sum up and utilize our own successful experience in training and managing our athletes on one hand and , on the other hand , persist in opening to the outside world , continue to draw on the good practices of foreign countries which are conducive to raising the level of our athletics , make full use of the modern science and technology to enhance the quality of training , and enable China 's athletics to attain a still greater development in the new century .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Market competition hinges , to a considerable extent , upon the quality and functions of products .  In order to implement the open strategy of pluralistic markets and " walking out , " it is imperative to concentrate our efforts on heightening the quality and grades of export commodities and enhancing their competitiveness , otherwise , it will be very difficult to guarantee the original market shares , and still more difficult to open up new international markets .  As a result , China 's level of opening to the outside world will be seriously impaired .  
It has been recently learned from a relevant department of the Central Organization Committee under the CPC Central Committee : China has basically completed organizational restructuring at provincial level .  China 's provincial governments have reduced 74,000 personnel , and the number of provincial government organizations has been reduced from 55 to 40 .  Party and government departments have internally streamlined and cut 20 percent of their subordinate organizations on average .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
They may be settled in the original places of their spouses or the location of their marriage .  If their spouses have moved with the military units and have been registered residents for four years in Beijing , three years in Shanghai , or two years in Tianjin , Chongqing , a provincial or regional capital , or a city of a sub-provincial level or if their spouses are registered residents in any other cities , they may settle in that city .  
Relying on the grassroots level party organizations , Ningxia clearly pointed out the focus of education , adopted the method of running study classes on the legal system , and conducted meticulous ideological and political education among the infatuated followers .  
In light of the principle of " uniting , educating , and saving the majority and following the law to attack the tiny minority , " the Ningxia party committee and government established the system of party and government chiefs holding overall responsibility and the leaders at each level assuming direct responsibility .  The regional party committee and government also assigned responsibility to the leading cadres at all levels .  Whoever slackens the work of transformation through supervision and education should be held responsible for negligence .

The public security organs confirmed that the dead Falungong diehard [ Xinhua Hong Kong version reads " the dead person " ] was Tan Yihui , male , Han nationality , with junior middle school education level , unmarried , born on 5 August 1975 , who lived at 117 North Jianmin Lane , Changde City , Hunan ; he was a native of Taoyuan County , Hunan , and his identity card number was 432401750805303 .  
Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
We should guarantee the normal operation of political power at the grassroots level and establish a supervising and managing system for the reduction of peasants ' burdens .  We should continue to straighten up wanton collection of fees by middle and primary schools in rural areas , wanton collection of water and power charges in rural areas , apportioning of fees for newspaper , and demanding money and things for activities in order to achieve certain targets .  
However , after over 20 " tigers " at the provincial and ministerial level have been knocked down , the government has also been vigorously promoting clean government and giving important posts to those officials who are honest and clean and competent in fighting corruption .  Therefore , as soon as Zhang Guoguang took up the post of acting provincial governor of Hubei Province , he vowed : Whoever does not fight corruption should step down .  
Several decades of effort have brought dramatic changes to the Chinese countryside , and combined agricultural production capacity has taken several steps at a time consecutively .  After several thousand years , China 's troubling problem of feeding its people has finally been resolved and farmers ' lives overall have attained a level of relative comfort .  
Some awakened " Falungong " followers expressed their belief that " now that we are rid of Li Hongzhi 's spiritual yoke , we feel very relaxed , and feel that life is so beautiful , leaders at every level are so amiable and respectful , the Party and the government are so great and right . "  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
The committee members pointed out : With the successful fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , our nation has basically solved the issue of providing sufficient food and clothing for the 1.3 billion people throughout the country , and the living standards of the people in the main have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .  The leaders of the five countries affirmed the steady development of bilateral trade with China , but also expressed concern over the existing problems .  For example , the volume of trade is not large enough ;  
While increasing their traditional commodity trade , the enterprises will also gradually expand economic and technological cooperation and reciprocal investments , and will especially advance their joint-venture cooperation in the high-tech field .  This will not only enhance the level of economic and trade cooperation and enrich the contents of cooperation , but will also bring about greater economic benefits to both sides .  This time , a batch of Chinese entrepreneurs with substantive economic strength joined the visit , and this won good comments from the five host countries .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure . "  Today , the quality and efficiency of China 's economic development have both been enhanced to an unprecedentedly high level .  
From an international viewpoint , after a country 's GDP has increased to a certain level , it usually will slow down its economic growth to ensure stable and coordinated economic and social development .  
The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Following the central authorities ' guideline , Fujian will take more effective measures to push Fujian-Taiwan economic and trade cooperation to a new level , seriously study the trend and requirements of Taiwan investment , study the plan and development strategy of the transfer of Taiwan 's technology-based industry to outside the island , seriously study measures needed to cope with the transfer of Taiwan 's high-technology industry , and double our efforts to lay down a plan on utilizing Taiwan capital by Fujian 's key industries .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Guangdong must continue to act on Comrade Jiang Zemin 's instructions , namely " creating new strengths and reaching a higher level . "  First of all , Guangdong must give play to its political , institutional , and geographical advantages and speed up changing the government functions and improving the market economic order so as to become the forerunner in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
We should use the information net and other advanced technological means to enhance the level of market management and take further advantage of the competitive strong points of commodity markets , while focusing on cultivating and developing markets for key elements such as capital , technology , and labor , so as to promote the rational flow of the key elements of production .  
Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
China 's current economic foundation has been transformed from a traditional planned economy into a socialist market economy .  Should its upper level not change ?  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
It demonstrated that provincial and ministerial level officials are no longer " above being punished . "  Yet regretfully , big cases keep cropping up , becoming just as Hu Angan , an expert on national conditions , describes it , " more and more rampant , like an infectious disease . "  
At the meeting of the Anhui delegation , deputies Wang Taihua , Meng Fulin , Zhao Shucong , and Xu Li aired their respective views on developing democracy and strengthening the building of the legal system at the grassroots level , increasing peasants ' income and reducing their burden , and improving work style .  
The Henan Provincial Party Committee has decided to start with members of its standing committee , to start with organs under the provincial authorities , and to start with all levels of leading cadres .  Let the higher authorities set an example to their subordinates .  We must guide vast numbers of cadres , so that they would devote their energies to improving their ideological level and work capability ;  
Xu Youfang said : As long as we maintain a sober understanding , fix our positions accurately , take positive action , and make full preparations , we can certainly seize hold of the opportunities brought by the WTO entry , surmount all sorts of possible difficulties , and push the national economic and social development forward to a new level during the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
Third , the urban and rural structure will be adjusted , the process of urbanization will be advanced steadily and positively , the rate of urbanization in the whole province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
Fifth , the structure of the personnel training will be adjusted .  While basic education is consolidated , high school education and tertiary education will be developed greatly .  The rate of tertiary education receivers in Henan Province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
In the next five to 10 years , Guangxi will increase the number of cities , will strengthen the cities ' ability to gather various production factors and promote economic and social development in their surrounding areas .  The size of existing large and medium cities will be appropriately expanded .  The infrastructure facilities there will be improved and strengthened .  The level of urban planning , urban construction , and urban management will be further enhanced .  
The deputies unanimously stated : More attention should be given to building political and legal affairs institutions at the grassroots level in remote border areas , and to heightening overall quality of political and legal affairs workers at the grassroots level as well .  
During the discussion , the deputies unanimously stated : Over the past year , the " two supremes [ the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate ] " have strengthened judicial work in an all-round way ; have intensified legal supervision , deepened reform , or made redoubled efforts to build a contingent ; have pressed ahead with court reform or procuratorate reform at the grassroots level by firmly keeping in mind the overall interests of party and state work ; and have thus made fresh headway in all sorts of work .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .  
The two sides are satisfied with the way their bilateral relations are developing and wish to propel their countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural arenas to develop to a still higher level .  
Wen Jiabao went down to the fields to observe the way crops sown in late autumn were growing and the preparations for plowing and sowing of crops in the spring ; visited peasant households to acquainted himself with the livelihood of the masses ; and had discussions with cadres at grassroots level and farmers to study measures of restructuring agriculture , developing the rural economy , and increasing farmers ' income .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
he heard briefings by leading comrades of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , the Xinjiang Production and construction Corps , and Shaanxi Province on implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region as well as views and suggestions made by them on army units ' support of such development .  He inspected a number of key projects built with aid provided by units of armed forces .  He also took part in voluntary tree planting and met with leading cadres at or above the division level from units stationed in Xinjiang and Shaanxi .  
Ours is a big developing country with a population of nearly 1.3 billion , where the level of economic and social development and the people 's living standards are still rather low ; in such a situation , our country also has a tremendous demand potential and very vast market space .  
With reserves of that size , he said , Hong Kong had a government with no debt ; accumulated fiscal reserves around US $ 48 billion ; a simple tax system and corporate and personal taxes at a level amongst the lowest in the world . 
" The success of this two-pronged approach is evidenced by the fact that we have not only raised sufficient revenue to meet our spending needs but we have also built up a very healthy level of fiscal reserves . 
These four crucial factors which are not going to change include the legal system ; the free entrepreneurial spirit that Hong Kong upholds and a level playing field thus created ; the clean and efficient Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) civil service ; and the free flow of information .  
The spokesman also said the Government is determined to protect the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .  These include the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field , an honest , efficient and politically neutral civil service , a first class economic infrastructure and the free flow of information .  
At the government level , the Financial Services Bureau is responsible for ensuring that the SAR has in place an adequate and efficient policy and legislative framework conducive to a favourable and fair environment for the securities industry and to proper protection for investors .  
Noting that these were but a few examples of Hong Kong 's financial market development in the foreseeable future , he said the Government was committed to ensure that the software and hardware of our financial infrastructure were enhanced and sustained at the world-class level to meet challenges in the coming century . 
The guarantees of a high degree of autonomy contained in the Basic Law , free-market policies , prudent fiscal management , the rule of law , a level playing field , a highly-efficient civil service , and vigorous anti-corruption action were also major factors in Hong Kong 's continued success .  
The four important pillars which underpinned Hong Kong 's economic success before the changeover , which are the rule of law , a level playing field for all who do business in Hong Kong , a corruption-free public service and free flow of information , have all remained to ensure Hong Kong 's continued success as it takes on its new role as China 's premier international financial centre . 
Part of Hong Kong 's success is also as a result of our promotion of free competitive environment , the strict adherence to the rule of law , minimum bureaucracy and a level playing field and a strong commitment against corruption - all provided and supported by an efficient civil service .  
As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
Miss Yue said the negotiations on financial services were protracted and difficult .  She is therefore particularly pleased that the negotiations were concluded with a substantially improved package of offers with a very broad level of participation from both developed and developing members of the WTO .  
" All unemployed local workers who want to join the industry will be encouraged to undergo a half-day practical intermediate trade test targeted at the semi - skilled level to confirm that they possess the level of skills and experience required of a specific trade .

" After careful consideration of all relevant factors , we have concluded that the minimum allowable wage for foreign domestic helpers should remain at the present level of $ 3,860 a month during 1998 , " a government spokesman said .  
" Of this , $ 16.2 billion comes from higher than expected receipts from stamp duty , reflecting the exceptional level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the first half of the financial year . 
Announcing details of the Study on Sustainable Development for the 21st Century ( SUSDEV21 ) at a press conference today ( Monday ) , the Director of Planning , Dr Peter Pun , said : " If Hong Kong is to continue to thrive in the next century , we need to maintain our environmental quality at an acceptable level and safeguard the integrity of our natural resource base and cultural heritage while at the same time continuing to meet development pressure arising from growing social and economic needs .

China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
We are confident that in the coming few years , there will be an adequate supply of public rental flats to keep the average waiting time at the level of around three years .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
The Government will strive to provide an institutional environment that is conducive to market development , in particular , to reinforce Hong Kong 's institutional strengths , such as the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .  
After assessing all these factors , the consultant has confirmed that the overall fire safety level of old public housing estates is comparable to that of Code-complying private buildings of the same age .  Nevertheless , since solid-core doors have longer fire resistance and are now generally used as the standard for fire resistant doors in the industry , replacement of hollow flat entrance doors with fire-resistant ones for flats at " dead ends " should further enhance the fire safety of old public housing estates .  
( c ) whether the level of rents of the Cyberport offices is lower than that of the offices of comparable quality in private commercial buildings ; if so , whether the unfavourable tenancy position of the Cyberport offices is the reason for the Administration 's setting low rents to attract tenants ; whether they have assessed if such a measure will result in a competition for profits with the private sector and deal a blow to the rental market of private commercial offices ; and  
The Heritage Foundation acknowledged that Hong Kong 's virtues included a duty-free port , very low barriers to foreign investment , very low level of restrictions in banking and finance , low level of intervention in wages and prices , strong property rights and a low level of black market activity .  
Mr Leung said that Hong Kong must maintain its institutional strengths , the unique advantage it has over its neighbouring cities .  These strengths are the rule of law , a level playing field , the free flow of information , a low and simple tax regime , and a clean and efficient government .  
The innovative installation and arrangement of exhibits ; the provocative images and erotic charm of the posters ; the bold statements and suggestive messages of the designers ; the technical refinement and advance paper production of the printing industry have brought forth another level of excitement to this exhibition , " said Mrs Chan .  
" In fact , among the countries in geographical proximity and comparable economic development to Hong Kong , local adults boasted a zero per cent in terms of total tooth loss .  The oral health condition of the 12-year-old is regarded as very good .  Their level of tooth decay is actually among the world 's lowest , " Dr Chan said .  
Starting from August 2002 , all government departments have been untied from using services provided by the EMSD Trading Fund and they now have a free choice between using its services and the services of other contractors .  As EMSD is experienced in traffic lights repairs and management and it can provide a number of value-added services , the existing service level agreement signed between TD and EMSD on the basis of trading fund services is more cost effective .  
A TD spokesman said : " The e-ATS , equipped to adjust its output sound level automatically in response to the ambient noise level , will provide adequate sound to guide the visually impaired at the pedestrian crossings while minimizing the interference to the nearby residents . "  
As the output level of ATS is fixed , the visually impaired may find the sound level inadequate when the ambient is noisy and the nearby residents may find the sound level too high when the environment is relatively quiet .  
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .

Quoting the findings of a professional and comprehensive public opinion poll commissioned by Civil Service Bureau in October 2002 , she said : " Over 70 per cent of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80 per cent considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
The Chairman of JUCC , Mr Graeme Large , said during the ceremony that the ongoing function of JUCC since its earliest days in 1970 was to support tertiary level students , faculties and researchers in their pursuit of education , learning and research by providing them with leading edge information and networking technologies to connect speedily and effectively not only within Hong Kong 's academic community , but with educational and research institutions worldwide .  
According to a professional and comprehensive opinion poll we commissioned last October , over 70% of the respondents were satisfied with the performance and service attitude of civil servants , and almost 80% considered that , when compared with the pre-1997 level , the standard of our performance remained unchanged or even improved .  
The improved mechanism would comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments .  
A Transport Department ( TD ) spokesman said today ( February 24 ) : " This special arrangement has proved to be effective in maintaining the number of applications for vehicle and driving licences renewal during the three days before the Budget announcement at more or less the normal level .  There were no abnormal queues , and the arrangement was well received by the public . "  
" We shall in consultation with staff develop , on the basis of the existing mechanism , an improved civil service pay adjustment which should comprise the conduct of periodic pay level surveys to compare civil service pay levels with those in the private sector , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology and an effective means for implementing both upward and downward adjustments , " Mr Wong said . 
According to the Environmental Assessment Report for Tung Wan Option submitted by DSD to the Environmental Protection Department , the inorganic nitrogen level at a distance five metres downstream from the discharge point is predicted to exceed , by over 60 times , the relevant water quality objective for the Southern Water Control Zone in which Tung Wan is situated , but the report claims that the discharge will not have grave impact on the quality of the waters concerned .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
The new mechanism will comprise the periodic conduct of pay level surveys , the conduct of annual pay trend surveys based on an improved methodology as well as an effective means for implementing both upward and downward pay adjustments .  
To secure public acceptance of the results of the pay level survey and the new pay adjustment mechanism , I shall set up a steering committee , comprising members from outside the civil service , to provide independent and impartial advice on the conduct of the pay level survey and other matters related to the development of the improved pay adjustment mechanism .  The steering committee will commence work next month .  
To uphold one of the primary objectives of the SFO of maintaining a level playing field for all securities intermediaries , the guideline sets out clearly that the HKMA will remain the front-line supervisor of registered AIs , which are required to comply with standards equivalent to those applied by the SFC to licensed securities brokers in relation to their regulated activities .

* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years  
Currently , the electro-mechanical audible traffic signals are set to broadcast at fixed sound levels in all directions day and night .  While the sound must be loud enough for the visually impaired to hear during the daytime , the same output level can disturb nearby residents at night .  
Mr Li said the eATS with its new features - - ambient noise responsive output , directional output , and tactile signal - - would not only make road crossings safer for the visually impaired but also reduce noise disturbance to a minimum .  The sound level of the new eATS was decided after consultations with the visually impaired and people who live near signalized crossings .  
Approximately after 7 a.m . on the following day of March 28 , the school succeeded in informing the HKEAA that due to the necessary disinfecting and cleansing required subsequent to one of its students contracting atypical pneumonia , it had decided not to provide its hall as the examination centre for the advanced supplementary level subject of " Chinese Language and Culture " of the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination ( HKALE ) .  
Given the department 's proven ability to adapt and manage changes , a good technological base , and highly motivated and hardworking staff in the office , Mr Jones is confident that the CR could achieve its vision by establishing , by early 2005 , a fully computerized " world-class " Companies Registry which provides a significantly enhanced level of facilities and services , both quantitatively and qualitatively , to its customers .  
At present , if the Stadium is hired out for the holding of musical concerts or variety shows with musical performances , the LCSD will enter an agreement with the hirer , requiring that the hirer should employ professional noise monitoring personnel to set up three receiving points in the nearby residential area for monitoring the noise level .  The hirers are also required to present reports after the events to ensure that the noise levels do not exceed the statutory limit .  
I am confident because Hong Kong continues to enjoy many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
The chopper-wielding thug was subsequently charged with ' wounding with intent ' .  YMTDIV Commander Acting Superintendent Mr Mark Foster commented : " Both officers acted in a thoroughly professional manner and quickly selected the most appropriate level of force to use in the situation prevailing .  Their speed of thought in eschewing the use of revolvers and OC Foam and tackling the chopper-wielder with only their batons is most commendable . "  
" We will continue to provide business starters with a favourable environment , a level playing field , a stable macro economy , low taxes and a simple tax regime , a world-class infrastructure , a sound legal system , and an ample supply of quality human resources .  
In addition , Hong Kong has many competitive advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , people and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
" Since the prevailing weather conditions are favourable to mosquito breeding , all local residents should keep drains free of blockages , make sure all ground surfaces are level and conduct regular inspections to eradicate all breeding grounds for mosquitoes in Tin Shui Wai .  
Additionally , Hong Kong has many comparative advantages , including our rule of law ; free flow of capital , goods and information ; a level playing field ; a cosmopolitan lifestyle ; a transparent and efficient government ; international standards and practices of doing business ; and the list goes on and on .  
" Hong Kong 's success is also buttressed by a sound institutional framework - the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , the free flow of information , and a clean , efficient Administration " , said the Financial Secretary .  
However the sums involved are nevertheless very large , and the frauds leading to these losses have ranged from simple instances of false accounting by individual employees , to large scale intricate deceptions at the corporate level .  
Among Hong Kong 's key attributes are : the rule of law , backed by an independent judiciary ; a level playing field for all businesses , whether local or foreign-owned ; the free flow of capital and a totally convertible currency ; freedom of information ; clean government ; and low taxes .  
This includes a level playing field and unrestricted movement of capital , together with a transparent regulatory structure , an independent legal system and a simple , low tax regime . "  
The foundation of democracy was consolidated through local self-government . Agricultural and industrial production increased and economic construction was expanded . Nine years of free schooling improved the educational level . The rich traditions of Chinese culture were rediscovered and rejuvenated .  
With an area of 64.26 square kilometers , Penghu has an average rainfall of only 1,000 mm . a year , which is not sufficient . To make matters worse , the islands are mostly flat ( highest elevation , Mount Mao is only 73 meters above sea level ) , and the dark igneous basalt rock is porous .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
From the parking lot at the top level , 20 steps lead to the office and activities lounge , and underneath , the dormitory and individual rooms for visitors , and the restaurant . All the buildings overlook the Teh Chi Dam . Visitors are impressed by the graceful and spacious appearance of the Teh Chi Villa . The milky white roof fringed with orange eaves gives the building an ethereal outlook among the surrounding greenery .  
As a result , I discovered , as we rehearsed , that they had made a lot of progress . " The combined performances of the 10 dancers who took part in the 1982 Arts Festival provided a rare opportunity to observe the current level of Chinese dance , and how naturally traditional culture and modern dance training have been combined in a free environment to create a base for its development .  
Many children of upper level cadres were admitted despite their low academic standards , while many outstanding students were rejected . Because my father had run a textile business before the Communists gained power , I was naturally considered part of the capitalist class .  
New construction of buildings and roads is a continual danger to the city 's treasured historical architecture . Tainan County is wide and level , with an area of approximately 68 miles . With the sea on one side and fertile plains on the other , Tainan has long been favored as both a fishing and agricultural center . Its fishery fleet brings in more than 30,000 tons of fish per year .  
Company officials feel that another important reason that returned students left the company is because they " failed to perform well . " According to one high level manager at Nan Ya Plastics , the professional knowledge and ability the returned students possessed were very good , but " studying is one thing and actual work is another . " The failure to perform well hurt their prospects for promotion and the returning students themselves lost interest and were not willing to stay on .  
At the Mandarin Training Center at National Taiwan Normal University , for example , beginning students concentrate on pronunciation and daily conversation , and the main texts used include the elementary school textbooks used in the ROC and picture stories . Intermediate students use Chinese history . Some students also study the Chinese literature textbooks used in middle schools , newspaper prime and radio plays . The scope of advanced classes is broader , and students may choose materials that are appropriate to their level of proficiency and that are related to their research and interests .  
In the first , murderers and brigands are tied to a bronze pole filled with fire . The second contains Blade Mountain . Here those who blasphemed the Buddha or wantonly killed living creatures are forced to climb naked up a mountain of innumerable sharp swords . Punished in the last level , the hell of freezing cold , are husband-killers , adulterers , the unfilial , and those who urged others to gamble .  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
Q : Generally speaking , the characteristics of a developed country include a prosperous society with a high income , a high quality of life , a high level of trained personnel , and high mobility , goals which we are engaged in striving to reach . Mr . Premier , would you please discuss for a moment your individual evaluations and expectations ?  
Master Sheng-yen has two explanations for the turnabout . First , at a time when contemporary man 's living space grows ever smaller and social tensions ever greater , Buddhism offers people explanations for the flux around them and a limitless spiritual space to roam in . And second , as people rise in educational level , they gain a new understanding of Buddhism which they find more acceptable .  
Hsu Kuo-chiang left his Szechuan home at thirteen , and spent half a century serving at the level of a common soldier . Five years ago he entered a veterans ' home , accustomed to life alone .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
The Ministry of Education has made the following revisions : Now , students who have graduated from a public or private high school , or any higher level of education , or passed the Higher Civil Service Examination or Junior-Grade Civil Service Examination and has completed his military duty , or those who are exempt from military duty , may apply to study abroad .  
One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Ancient China was known as " the land of impeccable attire , " and its culture was always closely tied to the high technical level of its textile crafts . Its silk fabrics , for instance , were treasured commodities among people in other countries , and the Silk Road became a symbol of cultural interchange between East and West . At home its precious textiles spurred the development of the art of embroidery .  
In order to maintain rapid economic growth , spur social advancement , develop manpower resources , further culture and understanding , and join the ranks of the advanced nations , the ROC must actively carry out educational reform and promote the concept of lifelong education , spurring the nation and its people to a new educational level .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
In a less active sense , I hope that administrative personnel can be streamlined , that their level of quality can be raised , and that they can be more clean and honest . That is my thinking .  
Besides military work , the large capital investment and cultivation of talent can provide enormous resources for the future development of a complete air industry and for raising the level of domestic industry in general .  
Once public consciousness has been raised to a new level , then hand-in-hand , with heads held high and chests thrust forward , all the citizens of China can join in the march to the future . Before making his oral report on administration to the Executive Yuan , premier Lee Huan instructed the Government Information Office to edit a report entitled " So Proudly We Hail ! Salute to the 21st Century " . A copy of the report was given to each legislator at the time of the administrative report . .  
Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
On the level of Chinese history , it was the main stage of expansion of the Han Chinese to Taiwan and it worth exploring for the light it can shed on the process of development , on relations between the Han Chinese and the aborigines , and on the history of the Cheng clan . And from the viewpoint of world history , it offers a fresh and vivid approach to seventeenth century maritime trade and international relations . "  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
For the type of woman who is keen on studying , has a high level of education and may have held a demanding job prior to marriage , the unchallenging and stultifying nature of humdrum voluntary work holds little appeal . She might prefer to go in for a more intellectual type of voluntary work .  
During their first winter they discovered that the mountain , situated some 2,000 meters above sea level , had at least 1,000 hours a year of temperatures below seven degrees centigrade , making it a rare region of low temperatures in semitropical Taiwan and highly suited for growing temperate-zone crops . "  
In this flourishing market the real estate companies often inflated prices even within a single day , producing a stampede of buyers anxious not to lose out and sending house prices skyrocketing to almost double their previous level .  
Today seven teams with 29 members are active in 12 farming areas . Their agenda includes experimental cultivation of crops such as maize , paddy rice and sorghum ; soil and weather surveys to establish the suitability of crops ; hydrological and topographical surveys to establish data for irrigation and drainage projects ; and social surveys to learn more about the farming population 's willingness to work and their technical level .  
For supplementary legislators , oral interpellations only make up 3% of the total , with 97% being written interpellations . And ten percent of written interpellations are about local affairs , showing that some legislators still have n't settled themselves into being " national level " representatives .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
" The age of the solo aerial combat hero is over , the tendency in the modern air force is towards group tactics requiring a high level of coordination between friendly aircraft . " Commandant Chuang Chung-i goes on to explain that the students ' most common mistake is not giving clear enough instructions , so that an advantage only ten seconds away is lost through delay . " In a real combat situation , that would mean being shot down and killed . "  
Also in this level is a small table screen from the Ch'ien Lung period of the eighteenth century , showing a man and woman who could be either Dutch or English . With curled hair and high noses , the pretty blonde depicted in Chinese linear style surprisingly adopts the posture of a willowy Chinese lady .  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure . However , he only touches on the surface and reins himself in , stopping at a cheerful and upbeat level before delving into deeper concerns .  
The department found in 1990 that the rate of women aged 15 to 49 who lived with their parents or their husband 's parents within five years of being married increased 4.5 percent over 1988 . And the younger the woman and the lower her level of education ( meaning women with more financial difficulties ) , the more likely she was to live with one set of parents .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
Little did people expect that the economy was brittle , and an unprecedentedly severe recession set in . The unemployment rate , including that for high level positions , rose dramatically , and housing prices collapsed . Many people who had had stable incomes were laid off or took paycuts . Moreover , bank interest rates showed a large increase , and monthly payments thus began to exceed people 's budgets .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
High mountains , clear water , slithering fish , skittering shrimp : Shanmeiis primarily situated on a slope at about 500 meters above sea level . The junction of the Tsengwen River and its tributary the Tanayiku River is just nearby . The area is densely packed with trees , with a pervasive sense of nature ; the clear , sweet river water is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation for the villagers .  
" Star " level personalities with attractive faces and sleek bodies would cooperate with a professional photographer to produce a series of carefully calculated shots . These would be published as " personal albums " wrapped in clear plastic ( they could only be thumbed through after purchase ) , and provided as products for the enjoyment of movie stars ' and singers ' fans .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
Building the ideal of " equal and mutually beneficial relations " : In fact , following the inaugural visit of high-level US or European officials by the French Minister of Industry in January of 1991 , in these two years there have been no less than 50 visits by European or American officials ranked at the vice-minister level or above . Most of them came to Taiwan under the rubric of unofficial participation in privately sponsored conferences on bilateral economic cooperation , and did n't play up their visits along the way .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Established during the period of Japanese occupation , the Ho Cheng Group ( HCG ) is an old , well-known native Taiwanese company . In its first 50 years of operations , from the boss to the lowest level of workers , all were pure " fellow Taiwanese . " That is up until 198l , when a seemingly rather naive " mainland lad " broke the provincial circle .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
On the other side of the bridge , the road climbs an embankment and approximately one hour later enters a tunnel and passes through to the quintessential stretch of road skirting the Chulu Cliffs . At a height of 770 meters above sea level , the view is astonishing and vast ; the quality of the road is excellent .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid . After sorting the wheat from the chaff , Bartok incorporated the folk songs into his own works , thus not only creating a unique personal style , but also preserving folk music and raising it to a higher artistic level .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
Shrines are everywhere on the broad yellow ground . There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
Although under the pens of literati since the Tang and Song , this fairy visitor among flowers had been washed clean of all connection with the vulgar mortal world , for the common people the osmanthus symbolized gold and jade , fame and fortune , and success at every level in the imperial examinations . So in the end even the literati could not escape the mundane .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
" Having aboriginal peoples making their own videos involves the problem of interpretation , " says documentary maker Li Tao-ming . In the past , outsiders often arrived with preconceived dichotomies like " mainstream vs . non-mainstream , or privileged vs . disadvantaged . They saw themselves as being in charge of the documentary effort , of being at a higher level than the subjects . This type of thinking must be smashed .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
The books say , for example : " When the qi reaches the fingertips , the fingertips grow warm and begin to tingle , as if there were ants crawling over them . " These idiosyncratic descriptions are enlightening , but might it not be possible to measure these phenomena with scientific instruments ? It is also reported that when one reaches a certain level of proficiency in martial arts , one sometimes experiences uncontrollable twitching and jerky movements , due to spontaneous movement of the qi .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
As the coastal region continued to thrust upward , the shallowest sections of coral reef rose above sea level , resulting in a layer of limestone . This rock has been mined for many years by the cement industry , but has begun to be depleted in recent years .  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly .

A : The original work itself is a highly ambitious novel , and a very successful one too . There is a sort of " sympathetic resonance " in this book between the uncertain social status of homosexuals and the uncertain international status of Taiwan itself . This resonance carries the significance of the novel to a higher level . Notes of a Desolate Man goes beyond mere description of the love lives of homosexuals .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
These ideas affected the ways in which writers chose to present knights-errant in their novels . Says Lin , " At the most fundamental level , knights-errant are supposed to embody moral virtue . So while a writer might allow his hero to be less than perfect in some small ways , he will always stand fast when faced with an issue or choice of consequence . "  
To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift . The problem was that the disaster covered such a vast area and came so quickly . Many mudslides and flash floods came with little or no warning , so that people could only watch helplessly as their loved ones were swallowed up or swept away , to be parted from them forever .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped .

Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history .

" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .

" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
And can one who is so in tune with the beat of the universe be equally engaged on a personal level with those about her ?

But her full social life simply enabled her to pour all the more energy into her dancing , without feeling as though she were missing out in other areas of life .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "

He emphasized that the MOE has consistently opposed the teaching of English at the first and second grade level . Furthermore , he warned that schools who persist in teaching English to first and second graders would automatically be disqualified from receiving any MOE subsidies in the future .

While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .

Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans .

The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .

Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays .

" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation .

Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture .

Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .

Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

In the interests of social and economic development at the global level , the international community must not forget the victims , once it had addressed the urgent political dimensions of such conflict .  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
Each national focal point shall , as well , serve as a conduit for the channelling of international and regional input , information and support to the local and grassroots level in their respective countries ;  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
His delegation encouraged the relevant United Nations agencies to contribute to the SystemWide Action Plan , which would be greatly enhanced by agreement on shared goals leading to concrete operational activities at the field level . 
At the theoretical level , it was more logical for an international judicial body which was impartial , independent and representative of the international community to make such a determination .  
It also confirmed the importance of a complementarity of economic , social , educational and information measures at the national level , including legislative , administrative and penal measures , and of measures taken at the international level .  
From that amount , OPS proposes that the operational reserve be established ( proposed Regulation 8.3 ) with an initial level set at 20 per cent of the annual UNOPS administrative budget , rounded to the nearest hundred-thousand dollars .  
Those services , which included advice and material assistance , were provided through social welfare ministries and bodies , and were not only offered at the national level , but also extended to friendly and fraternal States .  
Given the low level of voluntary contributions , it would also be desirable to prioritize training programmes based on their comparative advantage and to develop high quality programmes in cooperation with relevant national and other institutions .  
A refugee , the Chairman maintained , was the helpless victim of the breakdown of the social contract and blatant evidence of political or diplomatic failure at the regional or international level .  
In the absence of alternative hospital facilities readily accessible to refugees at more economical costs , the continual increase in the cost of services at private contracted hospitals made it impossible for the Agency to maintain its existing level of services without application of strict measures , including rationalization of referrals , reduction of the number of bed-days contracted and introduction of a system of cost-sharing for specialized hospital care .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Among their many and varied activities , United Nations information centres continued to play a pivotal role in promoting the Organization 's major conferences on development questions during 1994 by raising the level of local interest in the issues and keeping the media and public informed .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
Geographically located near the so-called golden triangle , Thailand has consistently supported , at both the global and the regional level , international efforts aimed at the prevention , control and suppression of narcotic drugs .  
Upon signing the agreement on the peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would recognize each other within their internationally recognized borders and diplomatic relations between these two States would be established at the ambassadorial level .  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
Our economy , although subject to the blockade , will grow and will provide for and meet the most pressing needs of our people .  The powerful infrastructure that we have built up over three decades with what some have called the subsidy that Cuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of education and culture and a stable land of peace and order .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
A top priority of the programme has been the objective of eradicating poverty from the world as well as the commitment , on the national level , to take decisive action and on the international level to cooperate in the common endeavour to achieve that objective by focusing , both in policies and in action , on dealing with the root causes of poverty and on satisfying the human needs of all .  
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
In this connection , we are continuing at the State level to formulate plans to minimize the consequences of the accident at Chernobyl improving living standards , increasing medical services and implementing special measures to lower radiation levels in the population with a view to removing limitations on peoples ' lives and activities in the contaminated regions .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
In order to boost such development and lasting stability , there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by the international organizations and specialized agencies within the United Nations system , coupled with broader and more intensive cooperation at a regional level .  
At the international level , it was agreed to focus attention on and support the special needs of countries and regions in which there are substantial concentrations of people living in poverty and which , therefore , face serious difficulties in achieving social and economic development .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
The priority objectives of guaranteeing the social protection of the individual , promoting his social integration and guaranteeing social peace and harmony can not be attained without a firm political will to invest at the national level , but also at the international level , in the well-being of all .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
The Secretary-General of the United Nations , in his report on the three Regional Centres , contained in document A / 50 / 380 of 25 August 1995 , recognized and strongly emphasized the importance of the role that such institutions can play in drawing up , at the regional level , confidence-building measures , measures to strengthen social and political stability and the security of States , and to help in the limitation and neutralization of existing arsenals .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in the Professional category , especially in posts at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and sending forward more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , the specialized agencies and the regional commissions ;  
Supports the request made by the Committee at its twelfth session for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fifteenth session , and recommends that the request made by the Committee at its fourteenth session to hold two sessions in 1996 , each of three weeks ' duration , be considered favourably , within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
At national and provincial levels , water supply and environmental sanitation policies will be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization , while at the county level , programmes will be implemented to increase access to adequate quantities of water , improved latrine construction and hygiene education .  
In addition , the Declaration stated that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development required effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level .  
For others , emphasizing those rights was almost a pretext for relegating to a secondary level rights which constituted the common ethical standard of mankind : the right to life , to freedom of expression , equality before the law , free choice of representatives , etc .  
Even though contraceptive prevalence also rose rapidly over the same period - from 7 per cent to 33 per cent of married women - and the total fertility rate fell from the extremely high level of about eight children to about 5.5 , the number of unwanted births per woman actually increased from approximately one to two births .  
In 1993 , UNFPA organized a thematic evaluation of family planning services in eight countries to assess the quality of such services along six dimensions : choice of methods ; technical competence of service providers ; level of information and counselling available to clients ; nature of interpersonal relations between service providers and clients ; the presence of mechanisms within the programme to promote continued contraceptive use ; and the appropriateness and acceptability of services .  
The paper proposed specific approaches to topics perceived as sensitive or controversial ; called for new ways to select key concepts and set priorities ; and stressed the importance of ensuring that course content was clear and appropriate to both the socio-cultural context of the country and the age level of the students .  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .  
She indicated that the choice of method was directly linked to location ( urban or rural ) and to the level of education , with women living in urban areas and with a high level of education tending to choose modern methods . 
The representative informed the members of the Committee that the Government of the Russian Federation , having realized that the monetarist underpinning of the first wave of economic reform provided only a limited set of social protection measures , had emphasized the provision of a proper level of social protection as the main requirement for the continuation of economic reform .  
Replying to a question on the role of women in economic and social decision-making and the integration of their concerns into economic and social planning , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed the Committee that women in the Russian Federation were not adequately represented at the decision-making level .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , both at the national and the international level , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
At a time when national security should be seen more and more in the context of military and political stability at the regional and international levels , the time had come to apply the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments .  
As indicated elsewhere , there is growing cooperation with non-governmental organizations , building on the role assigned to them in Agenda 21 in relation to activities at the country level , and with centres of excellence and academic institutions , in recognition of the cross-cutting nature of desertification control , involving the social , cultural , economic and physical management of a territory .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
WMO also organized jointly with EPPO and NAPPO symposia and workshops to give practical training in the use of meteorological data in the fight against pest and diseases , in reducing the level of undesired chemicals and in improving the quality of agricultural produce .  
Violence was seen as a vicious circle repeating itself from generation to generation but one that was not irreversible and that could be addressed through multidisciplinary cooperation at the national level , greater condemnation of violence against women and children reflected in criminal justice systems , and programmes to prevent violent behaviour and provide better treatment for victims .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
States participating in regional arrangements or agencies are encouraged to consider the possibility of using or , where appropriate , establishing or improving at the regional level procedures and mechanisms for the early detection , the prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes , in close coordination with the preventive efforts of the United Nations ;  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Supports the request of the Committee at its twelfth and thirteenth sessions for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow for the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions , and recommends that the request made by the Committee for additional meeting time be considered within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
The Secretary-General is committed to a collegial , friendly and positive atmosphere in staff / management relations conducive to quality work at a level of productivity in line with staff qualifications and with the Organization 's changing mandates .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
They noted the general satisfaction expressed by the Inspectors with competitive recruitment examinations , but wished to seek clarification from them regarding the apparent contradiction in paragraphs 65 , 67 , 78 and 79 of the report , which stated , on the one hand , that the quality of staff members recruited through examinations had improved and , on the other , that the general level of candidates was rather low .  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in the Professional category , especially in posts at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and sending forward more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , the specialized agencies and the regional commissions ;  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
The instrument may be designed and established at the national level , specific emission levels set by local authorities , with monitoring and money collecting conducted by regional inspectorates .  
Supports the request made by the Committee at its twelfth session for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions , and recommends that the request made by the Committee at its fourteenth session to hold two sessions in 1996 , each of three weeks ' duration , be considered favourably , within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
The Committee was informed that subsequent to the preparation of the Secretary-General 's report , the Security Council , on 10 February 1995 , approved the deployment of an additional 30 civilian police , increasing the authorized level to 120 ( see S / 1995 / 130 ) .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
The broad mandate outlined in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has sometimes tended to be measured in terms of the number of experts from developing countries working on projects , the frequency of meetings to promote TCDC and the level of procurement from the developing countries , instead of being seen as a rational imperative for ensuring the full integration of TCDC into the wider conception of operational activities in support of the overall development process .  
In the light of current global realities , it is important and timely to reverse this trend and to renew efforts to ensure that the two concepts become more closely linked at an operational level .  
The overexpenditure under this heading was a result of higher requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement ( $ 171,000 ) due to the delayed departure of the Finnish contingent in December 1993 , to additional ration costs ( $ 78,000 ) to replenish UNDOF 's provisions inventory to a level sufficient to sustain operations while newly sought commercial ration contracts were being established , and to slightly higher than anticipated travel costs ( $ 8,000 ) .  
As already discussed , the quality of staff at the higher level is often impressive , but at other levels we are of the belief that quality could be improved through increased training and greater horizontal communication ( including perhaps the publication of an in-house professional periodical ) .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
It will also promote minimization , re-use and environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste and sewage through provision of information strategies , tools and instruments for improved waste management and enhanced capabilities at national and local level for solid and liquid waste management .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
At the national level , United Nations resident coordinators are actively participating in the preparatory activities for the Conference and are assisting in promoting South-South cooperation on urban management at the regional and global levels .  
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
Information services continue to focus on meeting the increasing needs of the media , both at Headquarters and at the local level , for timely , comprehensive , balanced and reliable accounts of the proceedings of meetings of United Nations organs and major important United Nations conferences , as well as of activities of the Organization and the Secretary-General .  
The estimated requirement of $ 393,500 , at maintenance base level , would cover the cost of general temporary assistance for the replacement of staff on maternity leave and sick leave and for additional services during peak workload periods ( $ 373,800 ) ; and overtime and night differential for the retention of clerical and distribution staff and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
A more precise understanding of the desertification issue would involve concerted activities , including consultations with major groups , at the national level in affected countries , and the recognition by Governments of its importance , that is , a cross-sectoral effort involving physical , social , humanitarian and economic factors . 
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .  
The Commission welcomed and encouraged the emerging practice of including representatives of major groups in national delegations to the Commission as an effective way of increasing the participation of such groups at the international level .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
There was great enthusiasm among the countries concerned for this major new initiative for South-South cooperation , which went beyond the objectives of the Caracas Programme of Action inasmuch as it sought , as the Group 's annual meetings progressed , to articulate at the level of heads of Government the economic problems faced by the South and to engage the North in a constructive dialogue .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The denial of drinking water has been particularly devastating , causing an increasing number of Sarajevo 's civilians to fall ill from contaminated water , and the subsequent maladies are approaching epidemic level .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
At its third regular session in 1994 , the Executive Board , inter alia , noted with concern the decreased level of contributions to UNDP and invited Governments to consider increasing their voluntary contributions to UNDP on a more predictable , continuous and assured basis .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .  
Resources from line 1.1.1 would be assigned according to the agreed methodology , and additional resources could be assigned from line 1.1.2 up to an amount roughly comparable to the 1.1.1 level , bearing in mind that , given the availability of good programmes , those resources were intended to provide incentives to improve programme quality in line with decision 94 / 14 .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
UNDP had encouraged resident coordinators to strengthen and establish thematic working groups on HIV and AIDS and to ensure their effective functioning ; invited JCP / UNAIDS and its co-sponsors to attend UNDP training workshops ; participated actively in global - and regional-level activities to develop a strategic plan of action for JCP / UNAIDS ; and was working with staff of JCP / UNAIDS responsible for developing the programme 's approach at country level .  
In developing the standards in appendix II , five principles were followed : ( a ) performance statements were made functional and not equipment-specific ; ( b ) fairness was achieved by establishing a high but equitable level of performance ; ( c ) a firm baseline for a minimum acceptable level of performance was set ; ( d ) the standards must themselves be verifiable in the mission area ; and ( e ) the standards must be at a level and expressed in terms that are acceptable to all Member States .  
As the major equipment rates apply to specifically designed second and third line medical units authorized under the agreement , rates are to be determined based on the development of a standard for the provision of force - level medical support .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
That high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
The authorized staffing level for international and local staff during the period under review reflected a reduction of 28 posts ( 12 international and 16 local staff ) in the number of additional temporary personnel proposed in the cost estimate and amounted to a total of 309 international and 591 local staff .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
The requested reclassifications of three General Service ( Other level ) posts to the Principal level would provide recognition of the additional and difficult functions assigned to very senior staff who have acquired considerable knowledge and experience of a highly complex pension system . 
They concluded that additional staffing was essential to provide the level of management services required for the investment of assets as large as those of UNJSPF , to sustain the global network of direct custodial relationships which have been established , and to enhance the investment decision-making process .  
Review existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
As a result , the Assembly adopted , on 23 December 1993 , resolution 48 / 215 A , in which it : ( a ) approved , on an exceptional basis , the creation of the post of Special Adviser at the Under-Secretary-General level against temporary assistance resources for organizing and coordinating activities related to the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations ; and ( b ) requested the Secretary-General to provide adequate secretariat support for the Preparatory Committee .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .  
In many instances they were headed by or under the patronage of the Head of State or Government , or the first lady of the country ; were established at the senior governmental level ; and often involved several national ministries , with the ministry or authority devoted to family issues , where it existed , usually assuming the lead role .  
A wide array of activities was undertaken at the regional level , including four regional preparatory meetings , with the objective of supporting and supplementing national and local efforts .  
There seems to be a common understanding among the above States that bilateral CSBMs , once agreed , should lead to greater transparency in military activities , thus having a stabilizing effect , especially in border areas , and stimulating contacts between the military of the respective States at the lowest possible level .  
National implementation of international instruments : It was recognized that a gap exists between international instruments and implementation at the national level : the lack of effective implementation of international obligations is due to economic , social and political difficulties inherent in the transition process .  
Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Both the resident coordinator and agency representatives will be held accountable by their respective organizations for the effective and coherent functioning of the system at the country level .  
Paragraph 38 ( b ) of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 specifically stated : " The United Nations system at the country level should be tailored , taking into account the views of the recipient Government , to the specific developmental needs of the country in such a way that they correspond to the ongoing and projected programmes rather than to the institutional structure of the United Nations " .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The activities executed at the regional level by the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific ( PROAP ) at Bangkok serve 40 member States . 4 / The national commissions of UNESCO in the member States themselves form a network of cooperation which is further supported by a number of networks of specialized educational institutions and several thousand key educators in Asia and the Pacific participating in South-South cooperation through a number of mechanisms .  
On a strategic and policy level , the Union 's supreme organ , the Plenipotentiary Conference , meeting at Kyoto in October 1994 , set out its strategic plan for 1995-1999 in resolution 1 of which it considers the subject in the context of the rapidly changing telecommunication environment under three broad headings : restructuring of the telecommunication sector , technological convergence , and globalization .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , each organization should set out the specific actions they will undertake , including goals and targets to realign priorities and redirect resources to meet the global priorities identified in the Platform for Action .  
Upon entry into force of this Interim Accord , the Party of the First Part recognizes the Party of the Second Part as an independent and sovereign State , under the provisional designation set forth in a letter of the Party of the First Part of the date of this Interim Accord , and the Parties shall at an early date establish diplomatic relations at an agreed level with the ultimate goal of relations at ambassadorial level .  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
Equalizing the risk means raising the quantity , quality and , more importantly , compatibility of preventive and control action at an adequate level on a world-wide scale and putting in place mechanisms designed to maintain and improve that level in a consistent and coordinated fashion .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In view of the replies sent to him by Governments , the Special Rapporteur felt that decisive steps should be taken at the international level to establish effective administrative and legal remedies which victims of intolerance or discrimination based on religion could avail themselves of in cases of violations of the rights set forth in the Declaration .  
A key component of its work is to see to it that national institutions play an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
At the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited .

The members and alternate members of the Board would receive , for each day they exercise their functions during scheduled sessions at Headquarters and Geneva , one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of the annual compensation equivalent to the base salary and daily subsistence allowance payable to United Nations staff members at the Director ( D-2 ) level , step 1 , serving at Headquarters and Geneva , respectively .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
NULLThe present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 997 ( 1995 ) of 9 June 1995 , by which the Security Council adjusted and extended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , authorized the gradual reduction of its troop level and requested me to report by 9 August and 9 October 1995 on the discharge of its mandate , the humanitarian situation and the progress made towards the repatriation of refugees .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
In recognition of the vital role of national meteorological services in providing warnings of severe weather events to the community , WMO 's Public Weather Services Programme includes specific projects directed at strengthening the capacities of national meteorological services and in raising the awareness and level of public understanding about the services provided .  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
NULLReview existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
Its objectives are : training of the key stakeholders in understanding the requirements and setting up the processes for the implementation of the Convention at the national level , and provision of substantive training material covering the Convention and providing the framework for wide-reaching in-country training by a country team set up and trained through the programme .  
In the space of only three years , the Convention went from a conceptual to a concrete reality , establishing mechanisms and procedures to carry forward cooperation among States in stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a safe level .  
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
In practical terms , this means raising the level of consciousness about the problem at both the global and the national levels , stimulating dialogue among all concerned and facilitating cooperation between national and international actors .  
Both objectives fulfil a catalytic role by raising the level of consciousness among the pertinent actors , generating functional dialogue with all concerned and fostering a collaborative process involving the primary responsibility of the Government and the complementary or supplementary role of the international community .  
At the field level , a letter dated 31 July 1995 from the Emergency Relief Coordinator assigned responsibility for in-country coordination to the Disaster Management Team headed by the resident representative / coordinator , or any other mechanism established to deal with a specific humanitarian crisis .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
Programmes and projects submitted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 , provided with adequate funding and approved in accordance with established procedures shall be formalized through specific agreements establishing the objectives , degrees of participation and forms of contribution of each participating country , based on its relative level of development .  
It is , however , in relation to national action at the country level - in assisting individual countries to translate the outcomes of the conferences into concrete national policies and programmes , and in providing resident coordinators and country-level teams with coherent system-wide support - that existing inter-agency efforts need to be especially reinforced .  
At a recent meeting at the ministerial level held in London on 20 December 1994 , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom had confirmed their support for the process begun in Brussels , recognized the importance for Gibraltar of the establishment of a sustainable economy , and agreed to cooperate in combating the growing illicit trafficking in the Gibraltar area .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL

For the period starting on 1 May 1995 up to 31 October 1995 , the MINUSAL team was composed of 11 Professionals , headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the assistant secretary-general level , supported by 8 civilian police , 1 internationally recruited General Service staff and 15 local level staff .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
IMO and UNCTAD have joined in a search for solutions , and now consider that the most feasible approach would be to focus on individual ports , with some aspects handled at the national , regional or even global level . 
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .

At the level of the United Nations and its agencies , the strengthening of the capacity of the system to support an integrated , effective follow-up to the Fourth World Conference as part of the overall effort to ensure the coordinated implementation of the results of the series of recent global conferences should be a key objective in pursuing further the ongoing reform process .  
The Committee also decided to strengthen coordinated support for follow-up action at the country level , through inter-agency task forces organized around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .

Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
The work of public administration should be guided by the principle that correct decisions should be taken , without unnecessary delay , and at the lowest possible administrative level as close as possible to the people whom the decisions will affect and that powers and accountability should go hand in hand .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
The region is the ideal framework for an administration characterized by an economic and social dynamic , frank and constructive dialogue between elected representatives and citizens , and coordination and a willingness to act at the operational level of local communities .  
With respect to this and to the general follow-up of the subject , we believe that the United Nations Development Programme , which has been doing work of this kind , must continue to play a primary role in this field , helping to coordinate activities in the field at the inter-agency level and promoting complementary activities at the bilateral level , particularly in State reform in the economic and social fields and in the justice sector .  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
The report pointed out that obvious indicators such as staff size larger than the approved level ( 300 instead of 71 ) , excessive overhead , large suspense account balances , a large number of unpaid bills and excess expenditure were ignored or not effectively followed up for redress .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
There is an urgent need to draw up and put into effect measures and strategies which , on the basis of international cooperation and shared responsibility , will make it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on this phenomenon and to do away with partial and subjective evaluations in rating the level of compliance of each Government in combating drug trafficking , or , still worse , in making use of this rating as a political weapon and pressure tactic .  
With the aim of laying the groundwork for a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development , several international meetings , starting with the Summit held in Miami in 1994 , have expressed support for the decision to hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
We support the efforts of the Angolan Government and the international community to undertake all tasks aimed at bringing about a lasting peace , social stability and the normal functioning of institutions at the national level , without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy the tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they could and should benefit from , given the huge potential of their country .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
For in fact the resources allocated to cooperation for development have fallen , on the pretext that up to now this has achieved nothing for the beneficiary countries , including our countries in Africa , whose priorities , at both national and continental level , have been to relieve absolute , endemic poverty , to eradicate hunger and malnutrition , to overcome disease and illiteracy , and to meet the needs for housing and sanitation .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
If we think only of these two items , 194 trade union organizations asked by their central organ to promote the objectives of employment at the national level and more than 100 parliaments also resolved to take initiatives on the Summit , we realize how this process has been gaining ground in the political and main social sectors in our countries .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In the year and a half since the World Summit for Social Development , many countries have made great efforts in implementing the outcome of the Summit at the national level by designating national focal points , formulating short - , medium - and long-term strategies and plans for social development and starting to take appropriate and concrete measures to implement them .  
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
In our view , the preliminary estimate of resources now approved has provided the Secretary-General with the potential to absorb costs , up to the level of $ 70-million , relating to new and unforeseen mandates in the area of international peace and security , which , it was intended , should be covered by the proposed contingency provision .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Organizations of civil society have been praised for being flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at the grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Her delegation was convinced that , in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Platform for Action , specific and positive policies must be formulated and applied at the national level .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
Such progress reports should avoid the need for additional reporting at the national level ; the Commission may wish to urge close cooperation , coordinated by the United Nations Secretariat , among a wide range of organizations currently engaged in relevant information-gathering and analysis exercises .  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
9 One respondent concurred with the proposal for annual instead of quarterly statistical reporting on international trade in narcotic drugs but added that quarterly reconciliation at the domestic level would have to be maintained .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 . 
On the social level , survivors required immediate assistance in meeting the basic necessities of life , such as food and clothing ; preferential access to social services , such as housing and medical care ; and strengthened psychological rehabilitation services .  
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
A vital element in the development and improvement of the Division is the appointment of a Director at the D-2 level with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large . 
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
In that connection his delegation had reluctantly accepted the failure to establish any of the 27 posts requested by the Secretary-General under the regular budget on the understanding that the number of posts and the level of appropriations under those sections were provisional and would be reviewed during the examination of the support account and that any posts that might be established would be the subject of revised estimates in the context of the first performance report .  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to an integrated and coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system should identify the specific actions they will undertake to meet the priorities identified in the Global Plan of Action .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
Recalling also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets , and the relationship of national manufacturers to their government , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) played a relatively effective role in regulating the use of frequencies and orbits at the international level , adopting a balanced and comprehensive approach to the task that had , on the whole , proved successful in guaranteeing access to the orbit and the spectrum .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
In addition , at the local community level around mine-sites , companies are providing enhancement to existing schooling programmes , health-care programmes - both medical and dental , including preventative care programmes and support through provision of social workers and also providing physical infrastructure such as water-wells , schools , health clinics and recreational facilities .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets and the relationship of national manufacturers to their Governments , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
Some States have established central bodies at the national level to develop a comprehensive approach and coordinate the activities of an increased number of associations involved in action to support victims .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Action at the national level has been coupled by international efforts to promote a culture of good governance and strengthened institutions and to systematize legislative measures to prevent and control the spread of corrupt practices .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
Global statistical surveys and methodologies for data collection and the development of indicators , especially for use at the national level , are crucial for comprehensive and uniform data collection from which global trends can be identified , which are in turn the basis for intergovernmental policy recommendations .  
Prepare a comprehensive report on existing international and regional norms and standards and on ongoing normative and policy efforts at the international level regarding trafficking in women and violence resulting therefrom , and develop options for comprehensive international responses to the issue , including strengthened preventive action against trafficking in women and girls and child prostitution ( DAW / DPCSD , UNESCO , CPCJD , Centre for Human Rights ) .  
It is also expected that regional follow-up will be discussed during the consultative meetings of the regional representatives of ACC members , following the initiative of the Secretary-General , who has requested the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to convene such meetings in order to facilitate a dialogue on the requirements and conditions for improved coordination at the regional level .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
To promote the fundamental principles of maintenance of the rule of law and good governance and to increase the capacity of States to devise and implement effective , integrated and consolidated strategies and measures at the national level , and to put into effect bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels .  
This will result in an increase in bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels , together with the promulgation of more effective strategies and measures at the national level to deal with sophisticated forms of crime ;  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
The Secretary-General trusts that the additional information provided herein will allow the General Assembly to establish the minimum predictable annual level of support account resources needed to meet the backstopping requirements at Headquarters by endorsing , at its second resumed session , his proposals , 1 / which were based on the outcome of the comprehensive review .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
As a comprehensive decision , the legal status must include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , and ecology , including the rise in the sea level and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States .  
In view of the low level of contributions registered during the past biennium , the Board emphasized the Institute 's urgent need to make an active and strong fund-raising effort , to ensure an adequate flow of contributions to its Trust Fund .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
The preconditions included an existing level of experience and education in order to quickly absorb new knowledge ; the organization of existing groups and institutions in a way that enabled the smooth flow of relevant information ; close collaboration between research groups in order to produce the best results ; international cooperation ; and , in particular , cooperation with more experienced partners in order to successfully transfer technology and subsidies from government or other sources .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
The prime objective of the task forces is to assure that adequate support from the headquarters level is provided to the resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams in each country so that they may , in full consultation with national Governments , facilitate a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences ( para . 39 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 ) .  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
The executive secretaries of the regional economic commissions will be asked to produce a product analogous to that requested of the resident coordinator , focusing on regional aspects of the major thrusts of United Nations system activities in the regional level .  
In order to strengthen cooperation at the inter-agency level , ACC established in 1995-three ad hoc inter-agency task forces to provide integrated support for country-level action around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development , with the World Bank serving as lead agency ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods , with the ILO as lead agency ; and ( c ) basic social services for all , with UNFPA as lead agency .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Considering the Security Council sanctions an inalienable and integral part of the international efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia , Ukraine has complied with all United Nations resolutions concerning the obligatory trade and economic embargo against the FRY and has taken appropriate measures on a national level to ensure their observance .  
Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Through the application of a relational and multidisciplinary database , a selection of economic , cultural and social variables is linked to the biophysical condition of forest resources in selected sites at the local level where periodic assessments are conducted to also observe the dynamics of change .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
At the international level , at least three activities are needed to improve coordination : ( a ) harmonization of coordination and cooperation between policy and planning frameworks at the country level to avoid confusion and overlap , ( b ) critical evaluation of emerging approaches to facilitate speedy adoption of feasible solutions and ( c ) easy access to information at international , regional , country and project levels .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .

While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
The majority of the replies stressed that to maintain the momentum for the implementation of the commitments adopted at Copenhagen , concrete initiatives at the national level were required with strong and visible support from the United Nations and the United Nations system and other multilateral institutions .

The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .  
Population growth , both on a national scale and on a more localized level ( such as urban migration ) ; the erosion of the family structure resulting in the deprivation of one of the best stabilizing elements in the lives of children ; and the erosion of societal and spiritual values which also adversely affects the judgements of parents , who may view the child as a factor of production or as an investment for economic reasons rather than an entity vested with substantive rights and inherent dignity , are other causes of the exploitation of children .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .

Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
The members and alternate members of the Arbitration Board would receive for each day they exercise their functions during scheduled sessions at Headquarters and at Geneva , one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of the annual compensation equivalent to the base salary and daily subsistence allowance payable to United Nations staff members at the Director ( D-2 ) level , step I , serving at Headquarters and Geneva respectively .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The privatization of the economy is being completed , the level of inflation has been steadily low , the national currency is stable and liquid , and for the first time in a little more than five years of independence we have registered economic growth . 
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
I am among those who believe that democracy and the establishment of a human rights regime at the planetary level are both irresistible and irrepressible , and that the limits are constituted only by the limits of personal liberty itself that is , when our liberty infringes upon the liberty of our fellow human beings for , after all , we are all social beings .  
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
At the present session of the Commission , the discussion focused on lessons learnt in the course of the ongoing exercise and on the substantive conclusions emerging from it that could guide practical follow-up activities , particularly at the country or field level , involving the United Nations system in a coherent manner in support of national plans and programmes .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Consequently , if the proposals are to apply both at the international level and at the national level , they must be articulated in such a way that those to be implemented at the international level have a counterpart in the standards and mechanisms designed to be applied in the internal system of States .  
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
As regards confidential data on Sammarinese individuals being transferred outside the borders of the Republic , the release of information is conditioned on the prior and motivated authorization of the Guarantor , who will have to verify whether the country to which confidential information is being transmitted ensures the same level of protection of personal data as that established in Sammarinese legislation . 
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
On the political level , active public life was generally closed to them , apart from a few isolated cases of women rulers5 and others who played a part in " town hall " discussions of social issues .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Centre for Human Rights should provide advisory services on the organization at the federal and State level of training courses for teachers in preschool , primary or basic and secondary educational establishments to make them aware of the importance of teaching the principles of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion and belief .  
Educated women in the urban areas of northern Afghanistan expressed grave concern over the restrictive measures imposed on women by the Taliban movement , especially in large urban centres which had achieved a certain level of sophistication such as Kabul and Herat , where women have played a prominent role in the culture for centuries .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
When the applicable portable tank instruction identified in Column 10 of the Dangerous Goods List and described in 4.2.4.2.6 indicates that bottom openings are prohibited there shall be no openings below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit . 
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
While welcoming the existence of government bodies competent to deal with the welfare of children at the national level , the Committee expresses its concern at the insufficient coordination between these bodies as well as between national and local bodies in developing a comprehensive approach to the implementation of the Convention .  
While viewing with interest the extensive delegation to non-governmental organizations of delivery of certain support services to children and their families , the Committee considers that the ultimate responsibility for the quality of such Government _ supported services rests with the State party - be it at the central or local level - and that delegated programmes need careful monitoring and evaluation .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
For purposes of building mutual trust during the first , second and third stages of reintegration , constant contacts shall be established and maintained at the level of unit commanders , contacts among personnel shall be organized and special measures for joint training shall be conducted .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
Given the high level of technical sophistication that might be expected from certification authorities and the high level of trust they were intended to generate , certification authorities should , in normal circumstances , be held liable whenever the issuance of faulty certificates resulted in damages .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
The work of UNIFEM consists of bringing the reality of women 's lives at the local level " upstream " , so that they become a factor in policy-making and economic decisions at the governmental level , in corporate decision-making and within the global consensus forged through United Nations mechanisms .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
In preparation for its special session to review and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly , in paragraph 13 ( b ) of its resolution 50 / 113 of 20 December 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to prepare country profiles providing a concise presentation of progress made and constraints encountered in implementing Agenda 21 at the national level , compiled on the basis of national information received and in close cooperation with the Governments concerned . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
Its development , however , should not delay action , and it may not be needed in countries where major direct or indirect causes have been identified , well understood and documented , or where deforestation is not viewed as a problem at the national level .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel also emphasized the need for efforts to enhance comparability and compatibility between various international and regional processes on the development and implementation of criteria and indicators , and stressed the importance of mutual recognition among sets of criteria and indicators as tools for assessing trends in forest management and conditions at the national level ; and on transparent methods for the measurement of indicators and for the collection , assembly , storage and dissemination of data .  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
The representative explained that the definition of child sex tourism as presently worded was too broad and too vague and thus presented difficulties as regards its application at the national legislative level , particularly in her country which provided for the direct application of international standards .  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments and , at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
The UNSCOM 168 team undertook preparatory work for the December political level talks which included interviews of personnel involved in the storage , movement and destruction , and in accounting of proscribed missile assets declared to have been secretly destroyed in 1991 .  
At another level , the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its concern over the Afghan problem in the final communiqu of the ministerial meeting held at New Delhi earlier this month and expressed the need for the Afghan parties to move towards national reconciliation , in accordance with the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
At the current stage of geological and geotechnical knowledge of the site , there are favourable prospects for the technical feasibility of the proposed tunnels at an acceptable level of assurance , this being understood in the context of the practical needs for detailed information and the practical difficulties of meeting those needs through off-shore surveying .  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
The alert level varied between amber , orange and red during the intervening months , being mostly orange until very recently , when it was reduced to amber in March 1997 .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
At the country level , the General Assembly acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
In paragraphs 39 and 40 of its resolution 50 / 120 , the General Assembly reiterated the resident coordinator 's level of responsibility and authority , making him / her responsible for facilitating the coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the country level , and requesting that the resident coordinator be informed of planned programme activities of the United Nations system organizations at an early stage of formulation .  
Several resident coordinators believe that a more effective collaboration in country operations should be encouraged both by Bretton Woods institutions and the United Nations system organizations at headquarters level , while another group of resident coordinators suggests that the Bretton Woods institutions be associated in the joint programming consultation of the United Nations system , through common participation in periodic meetings on programming and coordination , and regular consultation on planning and strategy issues .  
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Fortunately , the opposing view prevailed , as it would have been rather superfluous and even contradictory to promote human rights monitoring activities at international level in ordinary situations , while at the same time denying their applicability during times of crisis or instability , though aware that it is precisely in such situations that the worst violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms most frequently occur . 
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
Human rights , as a code of values juridically accepted at the international level , can legitimately signal the ethically acceptable or unacceptable limits of economic policy measures and economic functioning .  
[ 43 ] / The main conclusion reached in this study on income distribution at the international level is to signal the need to include cooperation agreements tied to commercial agreements on free trade and economic and commercial cooperation , whether at the international , regional or bilateral level . 
The most complex processes now being experienced by developed societies , including new forms of racism , are a direct consequence of deregulated economic activities at the international level and of an inequitable and " wild " process of globalization .  
This is the most important resource possessed by our country , and the level of scientific development now attained is manifest in the existence of some 60 scientific research centres and an established body of scientists and research-workers that place Cuba on a level comparable with a number of averagely developed industrialized countries .  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The Committee was concerned about the low level of occupational achievement by educated women and male dominance in technical and professional fields , on the one hand , and the concentration of women in the lower-paid service sector , in particular the tourist industry , on the other .  
Also convinced that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievements and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
He agreed that there should not be a single legal definition of indigenous peoples at the international level at this time , although a definition might be required at the national level .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
The balance of the temporary assistance funding ( $ 634,900 ) , the same level as approved for the biennium 1996-1997 , will provide for : ( a ) administrative and technical support during the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Management Information System ( IMIS ) and the further implementation of remaining phases of the Fund 's computer project ; ( b ) assistance during peak workload periods , and ( c ) replacements of staff on maternity and extended sick leaves . 
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
Following a comprehensive review of the structure of the Lessons Learned Unit , and a reassessment of its resource needs , the Secretary-General remains convinced that the functions of the Unit can not be met from the remaining two dedicated posts for the lessons learned function financed from the regular budget ( one-D-1 , one General Service level ) following the anticipated cessation on 31 December 1997 of voluntary funding for other extrabudgetary posts currently available to the Unit .  
If in the near future an assessment , even preliminary , of the danger level for the climate system was successfully concluded , it would be easier to adopt a political decision regarding quantitative targets on reduction and elimination of greenhouse gases and to consider the outline of a protocol or other legal document containing the obligations of the parties to the Convention beyond the year 2000 .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
While everyone accepted that the primary responsibility in that regard lay at the national level , the Summit was an important and timely recognition of the multifaceted nature of food security and of the need to encourage cooperation at the international level to support the efforts of Governments .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
At the international level , the action plan defined a specific set of complementary actions designed to re-establish the necessary priority for improving agriculture and the rural economy , including two high-profile initiatives .  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
Although the level of resentment fluctuates , popular disappointment with the perceived slow pace of implementation of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , and , in particular , erratic food distribution , delays in the arrival of medicines and severe power cuts , continues to be voiced against the United Nations , and a growing number of beneficiaries decline to be interviewed .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Canada , which had played an active role at the Congress , had introduced legislation to punish offenders who sexually exploited children , including those who did so abroad , and , at the international level , unreservedly supported the formulation of an optional protocol to the Convention concerning the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography . 
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
The strengthening of security in the region calls for a comprehensive approach that includes parallel steps to settle conflict situations and eliminate hotbeds of tension , reduce the level of armed presence , strengthen confidence among the Mediterranean States themselves and their mutual understanding with other members of the international community , and develop economic cooperation in the region and with third countries .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
However , it is fundamentally true that the overall monitoring system could only be made comprehensive when the Council is able to conclude that Iraq 's prohibited programmes have been destroyed , removed or rendered harmless and the full extent of the level of technical development achieved in each of the prohibited programmes is known .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
A key component of its work is to assist national institutions in playing an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and to forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
The present report has highlighted the growing role of independent national institutions in promoting and protecting human rights , a factor increasingly recognized as important in ensuring effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
Singapore believed , however , that the guiding principles which would allow for the application of international law without the exercise of political influence and afford States , large and small alike , a level playing field , should include those principles that prohibited discrimination , coercion and reneging on previous agreements as well as those that encouraged the open and candid exchange of information and discouraged misinformation and the introduction of irrelevant considerations .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
It was therefore disturbing to note that the average level of ODA as a proportion of the gross national product ( GNP ) of developed countries had fallen in 1996 to a record low of 0.25 per cent .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
He indicated that in support of the devolution of responsibility to the most effective managerial level , in some carefully defined areas , consolidation provided considerable cost saving and other administrative benefits and could also result in more effective services , including those provided through the establishment of a common services facility , an area in which work was already proceeding . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
Education was free at all levels and compulsory at the primary level , health care was provided free to all sectors of the population without exception , special attention being paid to vulnerable groups , and young people played an important part in the development and execution of development plans . 
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
These UNESCO Chairs play an active role in upgrading the knowledge of basic values of human rights , democracy and peace at the university level and at the same time serve as focal points for promoting education for peace , tolerance and international understanding at all educational levels .  
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
The analysis has identified key characteristics determining MMR achievements such as : ( a ) the level of development in health infrastructure , particularly regarding access to and use of maternal health services ; ( b ) the overall reproductive health and nutritional status of women ; ( c ) educational achievement , women 's age at first delivery , number of deliveries , proportion of unsafe and illegal abortions , and violence against women ; and ( d ) the countrys stage of overall socio-economic development .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
At the international level there is a public information strategy the aim of which might be described as consciousness-raising , including straightforward dissemination of information on the humanitarian consequences of landmine use as well as advocacy designed to assist the process of imposing a global ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
As was indicated at that time , budget implementation during the current biennium would be notably more challenging than in previous bienniums owing to the dynamic efforts required to manage the sharply reduced level of resources within a short budget cycle and within a budgetary structure with limited flexibility or requiring longer lead times to address the necessary savings other than through significant reductions in staff costs .  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
In addition to that proposal , various other topics were mentioned with respect to which it might be worthwhile to explore the desirability and feasibility of work at the international level ; those were : legislative treatment of cross-border insolvency in the banking and financial services sector , preparation of model agreements or practices for cross-border cooperation in reorganizations of insolvent enterprises , conflict-of-laws solutions in cross-border insolvency cases , and the effects of insolvency proceedings on arbitration agreements and arbitral proceedings .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
We are fully aware that at the level of the United Nations , there have been a number of initiatives designed to help address the economic and social problems faced by developing countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty and the impact of those conditions hindering the realization of sustainable economic development .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
Sound political logic and balanced reasoning are required from all of us , primarily with regard to the pivotal equation , that is , finding the golden mean between the level of representation on the reformed Security Council and the imperative need to ensure its effectiveness .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
At the close of the Review Conference , the European Union pledged to continue to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines and to strive towards the goal of their eventual elimination as stated in resolution 50 / 70 O . The Union firmly believes that the international community at every level must intensify its efforts towards eliminating the causes of this international humanitarian disaster as well as getting to grips with its horrific effects . 
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .

Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
That global programme set up through United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the national level in many countries , facilitated the establishment of a network of representative basins , improving understanding of hydrology and water resource management .  
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .

This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors .

Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .

Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps .

Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
The charge for programme support costs for non-reimbursable loans is generally calculated on the basis of requirements for standard common services costs for a staff member at the P-3 / P-4 level , as follows : maintenance and rental of premises , utilities and office supplies ; maintenance of office automation equipment ; telecommunications ; secretarial and administrative support ( generally calculated at five personnel to one General Service staff ) ; and medical services .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women .

It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
In the Turks and Caicos Islands , technical cooperation has been largely aimed at direct interventions with a view to laying the basis for meaningful economic development .  In this connection , assistance was granted for the establishment of an investment agency , the creation of a national insurance scheme , and to improve customs administration and tertiary level education .  
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .

Because multilateral funding is declining and there is a tendency to become more dependent on directed multilateral contributions , WFP is intensifying its efforts to secure resources at the field level by ensuring that donor representatives are well informed of WFP activities and by broadening its donor base for the long term .  
IACWGE has taken steps to ensure that the outputs of the task forces , such as their final reports or the guidelines for resident representatives , fully reflect a gender perspective , including direct or indirect participation in the discussions of case studies at the country level ( see ACC / 1996 / 22 , para . 31 ) ( see also the report of ACC on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up to the major United Nations conferences and summits ( E / 1997 / ) ) .

With regard to the follow-up to Habitat II , ACC , at its first regular session for 1997 , decided that the arrangements should focus on supporting country-level action and coordination and should involve the development of guidelines to orient the resident coordinator system in establishing country-level thematic groups and strengthening implementation and monitoring at the national and local level .  
At the country level , the General Assembly , in paragraph 39 of its resolution 50 / 120 , acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
The report says that a change of this magnitude requires a package of measures that combine : ( a ) the strengthening of tax administration ; ( b ) the expansion of the tax base and the revision of the principal taxes ; and ( c ) the creation of a team that is committed to reform , supported at the highest political level and backed by a solid social consensus .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
They shall take joint actions in international financial and economic organizations with a view to ensuring appropriate funding for projects agreed on at the trilateral level , including requests to make use of the European Union 's integrated international assistance programmes , such as Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) , as well as appropriate programmes within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
As a follow-up to commitment 3 made at the Social Summit to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , 5 the Secretariat organized a one-day seminar on world employment strategy to discuss the Report on World Employment 1996 / 97 issued by the International Labour Office , and to reflect on policies that may contribute to improving employment projects at the national and international level .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
At the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the question of public administration and development had been considered , with a high level of representation and participation ; it was regrettable that the resolution adopted on the subject reflected only partially the valuable ideas and suggestions presented by delegations . 
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
Given that each country was responsible for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the national level , the Philippines had elaborated a national plan of action that dovetailed with all other national economic and social development plans , including programmes for the eradication of poverty , for the environment , for women and for children , with a view to improving the quality of life of the rural and urban population . 
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
These are , in particular : political leaders , members of Government and of parliament and of other elected bodies ; teaching staff at every level of educational systems and those engaged in non-formal education of children and adults ; journalists ; members of the intellectual community as a whole ; religious leaders ; those having managerial functions at various levels ; non-governmental organizations , especially of women and youth .  
The centres would develop train the trainer programmes to train peace promoters in the region concerned and to monitor and support their peace promotion work on a long-term basis , producing ultimately a diverse and flexible network of peace promoters around the world , connected by modern communication technology , for the exchange of information and experience in building a culture of peace at the local and regional level .  
The commitment made at Copenhagen to eradicate poverty in the world also called for action at the international level to ensure that policies and programmes will advance the attainment of agreed developmental goals that are aimed at meeting basic needs for all and eradicating absolute poverty ; the participation of the people concerned is an integral part in this endeavour .  
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
This was an important meeting devoted to follow-up of the Fourth World Conference on Women and was an unprecedented event at the international level since it brought together an equal number of men and women members of parliament from some 80 countries and provided the occasion for innovative debates on ways of ensuring the joint exercise of political responsibilities .  
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
Finally , at the regional level , joint training in investigation techniques ( profiling , search methods , controlled deliveries etc . ) will be organized , and a framework for periodic consultations on operational issues ( trends , concealment methods etc . ) will be set up .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .

Raising awareness and understanding , at the community and individual level , of the need to integrate externalities into economic reasoning , combining this with the sale of a non-traditional good , namely , certified tons of carbon reduced or sequestered ;  
The team recommended that no further verification of Iraq 's current biological weapons full , final and complete disclosure be conducted at the senior international expert level , until Iraq commits itself to provide substantive , new information .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .

At the national level , Egypt reported that it has undertaken a series of legislative as well as administrative steps aimed at curbing terrorism by introducing prevention schemes on the cultural , social , economic and security levels .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
In the ensuing discussion , delegations focused on the following key issues : the biennial support budget ; the level of the operational reserve ; funds from private foundations ; the national execution modality ; and unpaid contributions .  
In addition , it was stated that the fact that some States were parties to an international text prepared at a regional level should not preclude a universal body like UNCITRAL from preparing uniform rules on issues covered by such an international text .  
The overall objective is to provide analysts and decision makers at the national and international level with a sufficient number of relevant , timely and reliable development indicators .  
Such information may relate to the size and type of previous projects carried out by the bidders ; the level of experience of the key personnel to be engaged in the project ; sufficient organizational capability , including minimum levels of construction , operation and maintenance equipment .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Such treatments shall be applied in a determined scale to intermediate developed countries , and in a more favourable manner to countries at a relatively less advanced stage of economic development ; and ( e ) Multiple , to make possible various forms of agreements between member countries , following the objectives and duties of the integration process , using all instruments capable of activating and expanding markets at regional level .  
It is not a legally binding instrument ; it was designed to be a source of conceptual and practical guidance , setting forth desired actions to be taken at the national level and through regional and international cooperation .  
These would involve transferring genocide cases falling within categories 3 and 4 , and possibly also 2 , 12 / to this local communal level of traditional justice , where locally elected and respected members of the community would preside over cases involving other members charged with these offences .  
Another alternative would be to consider the guidelines purely as providing non _ binding standards and criteria at the international level rather than legal rules , but which , once incorporated in domestic law , would be enforceable at the domestic level . 
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
The Administration has reviewed its plans and projected expenditures as reflected in the tenth progress report , and has concluded that they appear to be accurate and the maximum level of assistance that will be required from the main contractor during the transition period and from other contractors for the development of reports will remain within the estimates .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
For the forest sector to become relatively more effective and influential and attract more resources , international and regional institutions and bilateral donors with coordination units at the national level would have to be engaged .  
The lack of political commitment was also identified by a few responses , leading to protracted , artificial and unnecessary international negotiations without any concrete results , especially at the field level .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
" The Security Council considers that a smooth preparation of free and fair presidential elections , for which proper steps should be taken as soon as possible , requires a certain level of political consensus and the opening of a genuine dialogue between all the constituent parties of the National Assembly .

At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
The aim of the latter project is to publish a world report on organized crime every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
The way in which natural resources are managed at the national level expressed in explicit or implicit policies was also identified as a major underlying cause .  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Recognizes also the importance of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including , inter alia , sound macroeconomic and social policies , so as to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
It will therefore be crucial to establish at the international level a conceptual and methodological platform from which to develop further a common understanding and a concerted approach .  
In its assessment of UNDP financial risks , the international consulting firm engaged by the Administrator advised that organizations such as UNDP , which do not have access to the capital markets nor the ability to borrow from banks to cover periodic cash flow needs , should maintain in liquidity the equivalent of 6 to 12 months ' expenditure as a prudent level .  
Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
UNDP is providing support to emerging governance and administrative structures at the highest possible level ( community , district , or regional ) for economic and social rehabilitation and reintegration in both rural and urban settings .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
At international level , our country is due to sign the Patent Cooperation Treaty , although alternative measures do exist to avoid the abuse of patents as well as monopolistic and anti _ competitive commercial practices on the part of patent inventors .  
As for concrete recommendations to combat racial discrimination at the international level , the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the promotion of genuine dialogue , mutual understanding , a culture of tolerance , and enhanced cooperation and participation would contribute to the gradual realization of a global civil society in which the phenomena of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia are doomed to complete eradication . 
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
Not only had India taken institutional , legal and educational measures to strengthen the role of women at the political level , but it had also taken affirmative action to ensure that women filled one third of the seats in all elected local , village and municipal bodies , thereby providing them with the opportunity to exert influence in the formal structures of economic , political and social decision-making .  
Proceeding from strategic objectives formulated in the programmes adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women and from the countrys current state of economic and social development , the Government convened in March 1996 a national forum on women in social development , with a view to upgrading the level of competence , living conditions , education , qualification and culture of Mongolian women and to expanding their involvement in development and progress .  
The fact that the level of cultural and communal services in rural areas has deteriorated and the absence of comfortable settings for work and living are increasingly causing internal migration of the rural population to urban areas .  
In addition , removing pregnancy and maternity benefits from a social insurance scheme and placing them under the Law on Social Care at a level below the minimum standard of living was a major step backward from the previous arrangement .

While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
It keeps the statistical records of complaints received , the types of human rights violated , the acts of violation and those alleged to be responsible for the violations , whether at the national level or for each of the departments in which there are area offices .  
The survey was conducted at the national level using a sample of 10,000 households ( 6,000 urban and 4,000 rural ) , arranged in a random selection in three stages , with probability proportional to size .  
at the national level , there are cases of discrimination against unmarried female pupils and teachers who , because of pregnancy , are expelled from private religious schools or , exceptionally , from State educational institutions on the ground that they may have a bad influence on other pupils .  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
In its report on the programme and administrative practices of the secretariat of ECE dated 7 October 1994 , the Office of Internal Oversight Services recommended that the ECE administrative unit be transformed into a fully fledged executive office headed at a level commensurate with its responsibilities .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .  
In some common law jurisdictions , arbitrators may enjoy a high level of immunity more akin to a judge , while in others a distinction is drawn between those acts of an arbitrator which are adjudicatory , and thus entitled to this high standard of immunity , and those acts which are unrelated to any adjudicatory function and thus subject to civil liability .  
A genuine commitment of all concerned parties at the national as well as the international level is needed to ensure a routine flow of reliable statistics and indicators at the country level , which meets national needs for information , and for the integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences and summits .

At the national level , this entails improving regulatory mechanisms and legislative frameworks , medium - and long-term integrated planning and strategy development , the use of economic instruments for sustainable consumption and production patterns and general awareness-raising and educational activities relating to sustainable development .  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres .

These narrative standards , giving examples of typical duties at each level , assist in indicating how the master standard should be applied in making meaningful distinctions between levels of work within an organization and in assigning proper grade levels to similar functions across organizations .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that the post had been classified internally at the P-5 level in 1992 and that the current classification action had been initiated in view of the managerial responsibilities of the post , which had grown with the increasing use of contractual services , involving an annual average of some 45,000 pages and an annual budget in excess of $ 1-million . 
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .

The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .

The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
A unilateral act formulated by a person who can not be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose and to engage it at the international level is without legal effect unless expressly confirmed by that State .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;

Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
The work of the various thematic groups , organized around specific cross-cutting themes emerging from the international programmes , should now be further integrated to ensure a more comprehensive approach to conference follow-up , facilitating the development of a corresponding integrated follow-up at the national level .  
This will provide an obvious opportunity for country teams , which so desire , to pursue several objectives at the same time lightening the burden on national officials by having fewer evaluations , concentrating on fewer and more important issues and using only one set of procedures ; increasing focus on , and understanding at the national level , of the overall contribution of the United Nations system ; economizing on scarce resources allocated for monitoring and evaluation .  
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .

Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
Where the total net remuneration before promotion of a staff member in the General Service and related categories exceeds that at the Professional level before promotion , established in accordance with subparagraph ( d ) above , a personal transitional allowance in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of subparagraph ( a ) will be paid until such time as it is overtaken by increases in net remuneration at the Professional level .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
Also notes the need to secure the participation of a diverse range of stakeholders drawn from government , non-governmental organizations , academia , centres of excellence , professional bodies and business enterprises in a partnership arrangement aimed at providing an integrated environmental information service at the national level , and encourages Governments to establish these partnerships under a formal agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme ;  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
Among them are retrievable scientific experiment satellites that are in the front rank of advanced technologies in the world , communication broadcasting satellites that have reached the level of medium capacity and geostationary meteorological satellites that have attained the international standards of the early 1990s .  
While the distinction was considered of some use in the interpretation of primary rules in an explanatory , didactic sense , doubts were expressed as to whether it should be included in a codification of the law of State responsibility , and if so , whether it could be made operational at the level of secondary rules .  
If the distinction had become commonplace in international law at the doctrinal level , it would be worthwhile searching for further applications of the concept , for example , by considering areas such as the law of the sea , environmental law and diplomatic law .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
The leaders of the world therefore pledged their political will and their common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries , with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half the 1996 level no later than the year 2015 .  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
Without energetic implementation both at the national and the international level , however , the insight gained will not lead to the aims set ; at a minimum this includes the reduction of the number of undernourished people to half their 1996 level by 2015 .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
It also calls for upgrading the level of knowledge of the multi-ethnic people to create a professional labour force of individuals with the capacity to meet the urgent needs of national development in the immediate future and to solve various social problems concurrently with economic expansion .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
They should be comprehensive in their approach , while allowing for the flexible use of policy instruments in accordance with specific national and sectoral conditions , including those in the rural sector , and should be pursued , as appropriate , at national and international level with a particular focus on :  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
UNHCR has actively worked , at the level of law , to ensure wider acceptance of the notion that persecution may be effected through sexual violence , as well as of the notion that women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society , may be considered as a " particular social group " within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
The fund was established with a base level of US $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .  
At the functional level , UNMIK has established joint civilian commissions ( JCCs ) to facilitate the process of a mediated and controlled transition to integrated public institutions and to address such contentious issues as administration and staffing of various public facilities . 
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
In any legislative , administrative or other measures taken at the national , regional or international level , it should be ensured that the principles listed below are strictly observed :  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
It was also noted in that regard that focal points could be responsible for following-up on the implementation of any joint programmes , conducting direct informal contacts on activities and issues of common interest , investigating and exploring possibilities and means of exchanging information , consultations concerning early signs of potential crises and conflicts and holding periodic consultative meetings between staff at the working level to exchange views .  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
At the inter-agency level , ongoing measures to enhance programme complementarity need to be accompanied by a renewed effort at identifying and focusing on common priority objectives and priority themes ; developing joint arrangements to respond to emerging requirements ; and concerting overall policies and strategies . 
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
The background to this actuarial assumption was described in the report of the Board to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session . 3 At its meetings in 1997 and 1998 , the Committee of Actuaries considered the methodology for determining the level of administrative expenses to be assumed in the actuarial valuations , taking into account that the number of retirees continued to grow at a greater rate than that of active participants . 
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Regarding the new method proposed by the Director-General for mobilizing funds for the implementation of UNIDO services , his delegation felt that the proposed approach would be helpful in raising the level of so-called voluntary contributions and it considered that mobilization efforts would be further assisted through the creation of an informal open-ended working group with the mandate of establishing more effective strategies to that end .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
It was worth noting that the decision had been taken by the Netherlands Embassy in Ethiopia , in close consultation with the Ethiopian authorities , since development experts in the field had concluded that UNIDOs new approach could make a difference at local level , and that the integrated programme would help to promote sustainable industrial development .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
As a share of the combined GNP of the donor countries members of OECD / DAC , total ODA has fallen for five consecutive years , from 0.33 per cent in 1992 the level maintained during the first three years of the decade to 0.22 per cent in 1997 , the lowest ratio recorded since 1970 when the United Nations adopted the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of donor country GNP . 
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
The profile should contain data on non-governmental organization participation such as geographical distribution : national , regional , international ; functional specialization ; size ; duration of existence and so on , as part of a system of frequent data gathering about non-governmental organization activities and their level of cooperation with the United Nations .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Notes with appreciation the efforts of those Governments that have maintained , maintained at a high level or increased their contributions to UNDP , and encourages all Governments in a position to do so to increase their contributions and / or meet their existing commitments to UNDP and to help to put UNDP funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and to reach the annual funding target of $ 1.1-billion ;  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
At the political and diplomatic level , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has enhanced extensive and permanent contacts among the seven lusophone countries , aimed at an effective and coherent approach in the international arena .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
At the current level of knowledge , the problem is still very much open-ended ; the available methodological approaches do not provide straightforward and unequivocal assessments ; and in the absence of sound and indisputable estimates , the level of subjective judgement is often above an acceptable threshold .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
This should be applied not only at the national level but also internationally , since the international decision-making process has become less democratic and transparent , leading to the marginalization of the vast majority of the worlds people .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using special investigative techniques at the international level .  
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using such special investigative techniques in the context of cooperation at the international level .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Apart from universal adherence to the 11 existing international counter-terrorism conventions , along with adherence to various legal instruments adopted at the regional level , new legal instruments are needed to counter specific forms and manifestations of terrorism .  
Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Developed countries should energetically pursue economic policies conducive to the healthy long-term development of all countries and cooperate actively with developing countries in formulating effective policy measures at both the national and the international level .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
UNCTAD should do analytical work and provide a forum for exchanges of experiences at intergovernmental and at expert level on the formulation of policies favourable to the development of the private sector at local , national and regional levels .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
His delegation was surprised at the contradictory approaches taken on national and international issues ; although the principles of democracy , popular participation , the rule of law , responsibility and equity were said to be necessary prerequisites for the rational management of a countrys internal affairs , they were not being applied at the international level . 
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
At the national level , it supported budget and assistance reviews leading to policy dialogue on basic social services ; at the international level , it coordinated United Nations efforts to promote the 20 / 20 Initiative and had assisted the Governments of the Netherlands , Norway and Viet Nam in organizing two international meetings on its implementation , one in Oslo in 1996 and one in Hanoi in 1998 .  
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs encouraged citizens to establish voluntary organizations to meet the needs of individuals and groups at the local level , and there were 142 such charitable societies that received annual subsidies from the Government .

The Communications Unit has an authorized staffing level comprising one Chief of Communications ( P-4 ) , one associate communications officer ( P-2 ) , thirteen Field Service posts ( 5 radio technicians , 1 operator , 3 audio-visual engineers , 1 mechanic , 1 electrician , 1 logistics assistant and 1 switching engineer ) ; seven General Service ( Local level ) posts ( 1 Secretary , 3 switchboard operators , 3 sound technicians ) .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
At subregional level , an Association of Women of West Africa ( currently chaired by Cte dIvoire ) which had been established by countries of the Economic Community of West African States planned to initiate cultural , social , economic and political programmes for advancing the status of women .  
At the legislative level , womens civil status continued to be restricted ; despite the ratification of international instruments , the offending provisions in the laws had not been amended .  
The question of increasing the level of commitment authority granted to the Secretary-General , without the prior concurrence of the Committee , for unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures was raised in a report submitted to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( see A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) .  
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The Special Rapporteur received excellent cooperation from the Government in the way of availability of most of the senior and other responsible officials he sought to meet , up to and including ministerial level .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
To achieve the objective of promoting , on a horizontal and integrated perspective , equality among men and women in measures and actions , in work , employment and at the professional training level , the measures for affirmative action must be considered implicit in the first three pillars referred to above .  
Sharing experiences and information , improving capacity of responding to the specific needs of women within the environment where they operate , improve the quality of the actions developed and , so that they can work in articulation with the Commission , as well as in cooperation with social and economical agents at the councils level , namely employment centres and enterprises for equal opportunity .  
The proper place for paragraph 3 of article 19 is within the context of prevention at the international and not the national level , for the following reasons : firstly , this provision uses words such as States Parties shall cooperate , pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements , exchange information and coordinate administrative and other measures , which clearly indicate the international dimension of its subject matter .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
There continued to be widespread manifestations of disguised and increasingly sophisticated forms of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia in the world , particularly in regions with a high level of economic development , a fact that had been recognized and denounced in various forums .  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
The Advisory Committee notes the statement , in paragraph 4 of the note by the Secretary-General , that general temporary assistance , in addition to being used to replace staff on maternity or sick leave or to ensure adequate staffing during peak workload periods , is used to fund specific positions which are associated with some degree of uncertainty as to the need for them to be retained in the definite future , either at their current level or in their current pattern of grades and categories . 
In its concern for a safe environment , the Council gave instructions for the creation of an effective mechanism to coordinate the action of ministries and other relevant agencies at the national level in each member State in taking proper measures to dispose of medical waste and process radioactive waste and also to coordinate the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
17 .  Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Emphasizing the fact that the realization of the right to development requires effective and efficient development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Also notes that debt relief alone will not lead to poverty reduction , and in this regard , emphasizes the need for an enabling environment as well as for an efficient , transparent and accountable public service and administration , and also emphasizes the urgency of securing an adequate level of funding support for debt relief , in particular the agreement for an overall financing plan for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative ;  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The establishment or maintenance , for religious or linguistic reasons , of separate educational systems or institutions offering an education which is in keeping with the wishes of the pupils parents or legal guardians , if participation in such systems or attendance at such institutions is optional and if the education provided conforms to such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Current international economic relations , being based on a unipolar policy and attempts by many wealthy States to impose an economic system or systems at the international level solely with a view to furthering their own interests , cause severe economic crises in the developing countries and are highly detrimental to the realization of the right to development .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
In particular , the initial proposals submitted in response to the programme framework on childrens health indicate a marked improvement in both the quality of the projects received as well as in the level of cooperation demonstrated by entities of the United Nations system in designing joint submissions .  
Also notes that debt relief alone will not lead to poverty reduction , and in this regard emphasizes the need for an enabling environment as well as for an efficient , transparent and accountable public service and administration , and also emphasizes the urgency of securing an adequate level of funding support for debt relief , in particular the agreement for an overall financing plan for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative ;  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
Each of the two competing and opposing systemic families was faced with a specific , endogenous and major adaptation crisis , with both crises interacting at the international level .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Likewise , on the future of the regional bureaux , I am convinced of the need for strong regional representation at the level of Assistant Secretary-General in New York and I intend to select and recommend to the Secretary-General senior figures to fill the posts that are currently vacant .  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
Participants were professionals at the level of director and senior programme managers associated with or responsible for safety issues in connection with operating airlines of their country ; the countrys maritime agency and port authorities ; the geological survey and land survey departments ; the telecommunications industry ; or the national disaster management board or bureau .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
It is anticipated that the revised programme of work as decided by the ninth session of the Conference can be implemented within the reduced level of resources , utilizing , inter alia , the gains from the efficiency review , which is currently ongoing . "  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
For areas considered non-core ( i.e . , not essential for regulation at the central common system level ) , guidelines set by ICSC could be desirable .  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
My country is fully convinced that States play a great role in activating social development at the local level and in creating an enabling environment , thus implementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing social development on a strong foundation of human rights , non-discrimination , pursuit of equal opportunities and the realization of social justice .  
Bearing in mind a steady tendency towards globalization at the international level , coupled with that of liberalization and economic reform at the national level , it is time to enhance international cooperation based on the principles of non-discrimination , open competitiveness , partnership and mutual benefit .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
While the donor response to the appeals made by the OCHA has improved , the European Union remains concerned at the insufficient level of funding received by OCHA from the regular budget , in particular the uneven balance between regular budget posts and those funded from extra-budgetary sources . 
This hurricane is unusual not only for its lateness and ferocious winds , but also because it spreads its force selectively and has caused sea level rise and huge , mountainous waves that have completely destroyed the coastal area in my country and others , where the population is concentrated . 
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that it is necessary to strengthen and extend every possible form of cooperation among all countries within the framework of mutual respect , respect for international law and the relevant international conventions , in order to ensure , at the international level , the protection and restoration of archaeological , historical and cultural treasures .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
We are creating opportunities to advance by improving the educational level of the population , continuing educational reform , expanding coverage and enhancing quality at all levels , particularly in rural and suburban areas .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
Unfortunately , we all know that the commitments undertaken in the Convention were not sufficient to meet its ultimate objective , which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Create and or encourage the creation and strengthening of institutional mechanisms at all levels , including taking all measures to ensure that national machineries as well as focal points within specific institutions are not marginalized in the administrative structure but supported at the highest possible level of government and entrusted with clearly defined mandates which define their function as a policy advisory body ;  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .  
She deplored the fact that resource allocation and financial decisions were sometimes motivated by ideological choices which were opposed to the principle of universal , free and compulsory education even at the primary level .  
With regard to the development and diffusion of biotechnology , it was emphasized that , while national level research and development efforts were critical in order to ensure , among other things , that local conditions were taken into account , knowledge-sharing through North-South and South-South partnership and networking and regional initiatives were crucial for effective transfer and diffusion of technology .  
Delegation cars bearing United Nations diplomatic plates and identification decals valid for the current session of the General Assembly may be parked on the first level and in a designated area at the southern end of the second level of the garage without charge while representatives are on official business .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52-227 , requested the Secretary-General to include in his tenth progress report a detailed plan of action and information on the final level of resources needed to resolve all outstanding problems so as to make the system fully operational , taking into account , inter alia , the study by the independent experts .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , 6 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and the Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
The independent experts had identified the shortcomings that had made the development of IMIS difficult , including the lack of a corporate information technology plan for the Secretariat , the continuous lack of adequate internal staff , the gross underestimation of the level of effort required for report-writing , and delays in setting up operations support within user offices .  
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
In the press release she published herself on 19 June , at the end of her visit , the Special Rapporteur endorsed this appeal and emphasized the vital nature of preventive action at national , regional and international level to halt the illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which seriously threatened the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
With reference to Paraguay , the Special Rapporteur points out that at the end of her visit to the country , she issued an appeal in which she stressed the importance of preventive measures at national , regional and international level in order to halt the illegal dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which is a serious threat to the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
School curricula , with the exception of those of monastic schools , make no provision for religious instruction or practice ; however , a prayer common to Buddhism and Hinduism is recited daily in all schools , and prayers are said in boarding schools at the secondary level ; no problems are raised by these prayers.The Bhutanese authorities have stated that : 
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Since 1994 , ICEPS has helped to spread information on the main activities implemented and planned by the Economic and Social Council , and , in general , by the United Nations system among actors with which ICEPS maintains regular relations and among institutions interested , at the national level , in United Nations activities but without access to adequate and updated means of information .  
Participants were professionals at the level of director and senior programme managers associated with and or responsible for the operating airlines of their country ; the countrys maritime agency and port authorities ; the geological survey and land survey departments ; the telecommunications industry ; or the national disaster management board or bureau . 
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
Regrettably , it was observed , some of the psycho-social programmes established in the past had separated children from the community and had been designed in such a way that they actually increased the level of trauma and anxiety experienced by the intended beneficiaries .

For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
That crisis had come as a severe shock after years of rapid growth , and had proved that no country was immune to the contagious consequences of global financial market instability , whatever the strength of its economy or its level of economic growth .  
Clearly , the active and growing participation of the developing countries in trade flows required a competitive economy at the national level , but also a favourable international environment .  
Even with improved pumping capacity and disinfectant supply , the operational capacity of many ( and probably most ) treatment plants is simply inadequate to counter the level of bacterial contamination in the raw water intake .  
The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
In order to be effective , DMOs have to be representative of relevant stakeholders at the local level , institutionally established and provided with the necessary human , financial and logistical resources .  
In a sphere which was so complex at the technical level and so delicate at the political level , it was not advisable to adopt an innovative and revolutionary approach .  
Endorse the core set of indicators thus developed as a valuable starting point for countries that may wish to organize and elaborate their own national programmes for the testing , development and use of national level indicators of sustainable development ;  
Activities include improving the quality of education for all children so that learning environments are effective , healthy , protective and gendersensitive , and each child attains a desired level of achievement upon completion of the basic education cycle .  
Although the least developed countries had launched comprehensive economic and social reform programmes , their socioeconomic decline had continued and the gap between the level of their financial resources and their everincreasing needs was widening .  
The Cuban Governments unshakeable political will was reflected in the position achieved by women in Cuban society , their cultural , technical and professional level and their high rates of economic , political and social participation .  
The existing local community offices will be fully integrated into the municipalities and their administrative structures to ensure the continuous provision of equal access to public services at the municipal level and the protection of community rights .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
In addition to conceptual problems , such as the Committees imprecise mandate in this regard , the definition of groups and a possible double counting as this factor affects the level of gross national product ( GNP ) , it is not clear that sufficient and compatible data is available to study this issue comprehensively .  
Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .  
Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
On the national level , Tunisia has found efficient solutions through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy political , economic , social , cultural and educational as well as strengthening the rule of law and government institutions , thereby distancing ourselves from threats of terrorism and violence .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
Four have been successfully completed ; a further four have been incorporated into other ongoing cases ; six have been discontinued ; and a further 10 have been identified as potentially suitable for prosecution at the national level .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
In its resolution 2000 / 64 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite all States to provide practical examples of activities that have been effective in strengthening good governance practices for the promotion of human rights at the national level , including activities in the context of development cooperation between States , for inclusion in a compilation of indicative ideas and practices that could be consulted by the interested States when required .  
Meetings were held with authorities at the local and national level with the purpose of gathering additional information on allegations , and to assist the authorities in their role of promoting human rights by sharing information on allegations collected by the Office .  
Despite the economic war waged against Cuba for nearly four decades , the position achieved by women in society , their cultural , technical and professional level , their high rates of economic , political and social participation , and the radical changes in their attitudes and lives were significant indicators of social progress .  
Objective : To foster a better understanding of the complex process of policy-making at the national level in a rapidly changing global economic environment .  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
Gravely concerned with the illicit manufacturing , stockpiling of , trafficking in , possession and use of firearms and , especially , those used in the commission of violent crimes and their contribution to the high level of instability , prolonged conflict and social dislocation that is evident in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole ,  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
Indeed , there was a strong view put forward during the informal discussions on 26 and 27 February that at this stage , it would only be appropriate to request that the Independent Expert conduct a preliminary study into how such issues are already being addressed at the international level in the development context , to assist the Working Group in its future deliberations as to whether additional work was in fact required .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
They also consider that it is essential to elaborate an integrated scenario for an Arab position in the light of the agreements that will be reached at the meetings of the Arab , African and Islamic environment ministers to be held before the Rio plus 10 conference , given that the unified positions adopted by these ministerial gatherings will have a major impact at the international level .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure , to the maximum extent possible , the survival and development of all children living in Latvia .  
In light of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that , the State party undertake a study on the impact of the Governments budgetary resources allocated for children and their families in order to assess their effectiveness and to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure the full implementation of the economic , social and cultural rights of children to the maximum extent of available resources , in particular at the local level and with respect to children belonging to the most vulnerable groups in society .  
The Committee is concerned that the principles of non-discrimination ( art . 2 of the Convention ) , best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and respect for the views of the child ( art . 12 ) are not fully reflected in the State partys legislation and political , administrative and judicial decisions , as well as in its policies and programmes relevant to children both at the national and the local level .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures , such as the adoption and enforcement of the Programme of Assistance to Families Raising Children , to the maximum extent of its available resources and in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of all children living in Lithuania , without discrimination .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
Emphasizing the urgent need for recognition of the collective and shared responsibility of the international community in addressing the root causes of the drug problem and threats related thereto in a comprehensive manner through an intersectoral approach and coordination at the national , regional and international level ,  
That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
At the operational level , it will be based on regular consultations and information sharing on the priorities established by national Governments and through intergovernmental processes with a view to enabling Africa to derive maximum benefit from the improved coordination of the activities undertaken by the agencies of the United Nations system .  
The increase of $ 141,600 includes the delayed impact of the new posts established in the biennium 2000-2001 and the reclassification of the post of the Chief of the Unit , which is responsible for the implementation of the subprogramme , from the P-5 level to D-1 , to reflect the increased responsibilities of the post and its greater professional interaction at the national , regional , subregional and inter-agency levels .  
The reclassification reflects the substantive nature of the tasks involved , as well as increased responsibilities and greater professional interaction with regional representatives of United Nations programmes and agencies , resident coordinators , high-level government officials at the country level and chief executives and senior staff of the regional economic communities , intergovernmental organizations and NGOs .  
Objective : To promote the development of statistics at the national level and coordinate them at the regional level in order to effectively meet planning , policy-making and administrative requirements for addressing emerging national and regional economic and social priorities .  
Nonetheless , the establishment of such focal points at the national level is a desirable and positive development , as the Commission may wish to reiterate , provided that such an initiative is accompanied by the provision by the national authorities of the minimum required resources , the authority to collect information from the various actors active in the field in the country and the creation of an effective machinery for that purpose .  
The decrease is the net result of the following adjustments : ( a ) the outward redeployment of six posts ( one-P-2 and five General Service ( Other level ) ) to the Library ( Section 2 , General Assembly affairs and conference services ) following the reorganization of that area of activities as detailed above ; ( b ) the conversion of five posts for sound technicians from general temporary assistance to established posts at the General Service level , given the continuous nature of the function .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking ;  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
The following priorities were identified during the operational segment : first , increased priority was to be assigned to demand reduction ; secondly , increased support was to be provided to Governments in countering the threat of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS ; and thirdly , at the regional level , increased attention should be given to countering the drug problem in Africa , without neglecting other regions where UNDCP was currently operating .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Although success indicators have been tailored to individual outputs in all the integrated programmes , it was felt that a more systematic approach was needed to obtain more comparable data and also to promote a better understanding with stakeholders at the country level of the expected benefits of the programme .  
The $ 14.9-million level of net approvals reported under this category takes into account only actual payments received ; future year payments under trust fund agreements signed with donors in 2000 ( and therefore not included in net approvals ) amount to $ 7.9-million .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
The review revealed progress in a number of areas , including administrative reform and state modernization at the central level , capacity-building within national institutions for humanitarian coordination and community empowerment to promote participatory local development in selected provinces , with special emphasis on youth and women .  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999 , decided to convene a high-level international intergovernmental event , involving political decision makers at least at ministerial level , to consider national , international and systemic issues relating to financing for development in a holistic manner in the context of globalization and interdependence .  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
At the tenth session of UNCTAD , held in Bangkok in February 2000 , Governments recognized that ensuring that all countries enjoy the benefits of globalization requires meeting complex policy challenges which arise , particularly at the macroeconomic level , from the growing interdependence of the various spheres of economic activity , including particularly trade , finance and investment , and the downside risks that this interdependence sometimes carries . 
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
The programme , by facilitating greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , on adopting a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on adopting more efficient methods of preventing human rights violations and removing obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Activities include improving the quality of education for all children so that learning environments are effective , healthy , protective and gender-sensitive , and each child attains a desired level of achievement upon completion of the basic education cycle .  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
In the same resolution , the Assembly further decided that the Commission , acting as the Preparatory Committee , should : ( a ) undertake the comprehensive review and assessment of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the other results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ; ( b ) hold three additional sessions , the first and second , to be held in January and March 2002 respectively ; and ( c ) organize the third and final session of the Preparatory Committee at the ministerial level in May 2002 in Indonesia .  
As reported in document DP / 2001 / CRP . 5 , one of the strategies to achieve a higher level of audit coverage has been to encourage government counterparts to use local private audit firms where there is insufficient or limited capacity in the office of the national Auditor General to meet the audit deadline .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
In the light of the achievement of near universal enrolment at the primary level , there has been no need for a concerted effort to establish a system of fundamental education for persons who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education .  
Objectives : ( a ) helping to raise the level of education and training of the Haitian population through improvements to the education system ; ( b ) supporting the economic and social integration of the population through productive employment and social protection ; ( c ) helping to improve the health of the Haitian population in the areas of reproductive health , sexual and child health and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) / AIDS ; and ( d ) promoting the right to basic social services .  
At the international level , determining change over time and producing comparable regional and global assessments require extensive data assessment and analysis , drawing on detailed data source documentation and expert knowledge .  
It is imperative to secure the achievement of the average level of resources identified in MYFF , especially for regular resources , as they enable the efficient programming of resources to meet ICPD goals .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Executive Heads further recognized that , in order to contribute to progress in achieving the development and poverty eradication goals of the Millennium Summit , the system should strive , at the same time , not only to strengthen country level support but also to enhance policy coherence towards the creation of a more supportive international environment .  This implies contributing to reinforcing the role of the multilateral system in the management of globalization an objective that had found strong reaffirmation at the Summit and also strengthening policy coherence within the system itself .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
Concluding comments adopted since the Committee revised its format for concluding comments , at its nineteenth session , include a short introductory section , usually no more than three paragraphs , which address the quality of the report , any other documentation submitted by the State party , the nature of the constructive dialogue with the Committee and the level and composition of the delegation .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
Participants emphasized the importance of traditional and local knowledge and practices to deal with climate variability , and the fact that understanding these and promoting them at the grassroots level constituted an important component in enhancing the adaptive capacity of LDCs to the adverse effects of climate change . 
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
The President also informed members that , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , entities of the United Nations system , including programmes , funds , specialized agencies and regional commissions , with specific expertise in the subject matter of the special session , might make statements in the debate in plenary , provided that they were represented at the highest level .  
By adopting the recommendation of the Commission on Human Settlements acting as the preparatory committee , the General Assembly decided that the last two speaking slots at each plenary meeting , with the exception of the first and last plenary meetings , would be reserved for participants other than Member States , the Holy See , Switzerland and Palestine , provided that were represented at the highest level .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
The sixth and most important step , which will have an immediate , positive impact , is to direct greater investment and efforts towards increasing societal awareness of HIV / AIDS , and to create an international sense of responsibility at the individual level , with greater emphasis on decent behaviour and adherence to moral values and virtues .  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
The PBC had also expressed concern at the negative growth in the operational budget and the reduction of major programmes C and D . Those issues were related : the main reason for the reduction of major programmes C and D was the lower level of technical cooperation delivery expected during 2002-2003 . 
On the other hand , a high degree of consistency at the personal level is evident : individuals who have a more positive view of the quality of the visual and sound information available to them also feel less burdened by remote working conditions , and vice versa .  
After the second experiment , it is evident that , so long as maintaining an acceptable level of quality of service in a new working mode requires additional physical and psychological effort , typical individual workloads expected during on-site work would need to be reduced if remote interpretation were to be used . 
Bearing in mind that corruption and the close social , economic and political links existing between employers of bonded labour and government officials at local level may be responsible for the perpetuation of this abhorrent practice ,  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
However , even the poorest country is bound to ensure the highest level their resources will permit and , at the very least , a basic minimum level of economic , social and cultural rights . 20 The concept of progressive realization can not be used to justify persistent injustice and inequality . 
The consumption of food in sufficient quantity and adequate quality to ensure adequate growth of babies and children , as well as women , elderly and other vulnerable groups , must be monitored at the local level ( communities , municipalities , districts and so on ) by the health and social welfare authorities ;  
The Ministers stressed the continuing need for international community assistance towards the stabilization of the region in peace and security as well as towards the strengthening of democratic institutions , market economies and adequate social protection structures aimed at preventing or overcoming situations of poverty and the attendant evils of despair , crime and overall citizens insecurity which may in turn foster tensions and conflicts at both the national and the international level .  
Having examined draft guideline 2.1.4 ( Absence of consequences at the international level of the violation of internal rules regarding the formulation of reservations ) , [ 8 ] the Special Rapporteur wondered whether article 46 of the Vienna Conventions on defective ratification , which was a pragmatic and balanced provision , should be transposed to reservations and interpretative declarations .  
The Government considers the success of cooperative development is fully dependent on the ability of cooperatives to overcome difficulties , including : the power of local monopolies ; unpredictable legal , administrative , customs and taxation rules ; lack of professionalism in economic and administrative control ; low level of business discipline ; and corruption .  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
Based on experience to date , the current funding level of the operational reserve , targeted at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year , appears sufficient to meet the requirements originally included in the definition of the operational reserve .  
While the share of the national recurrent budget allocated to the health sector has been maintained , on average , at the same level , a lower proportion of the health budget is spent on provincial health services where the majority of the population live .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
It was necessary to promote a broad legal framework that combined adequate recognition of customary law with other instruments of modern law , as well as its adequate protection at the international level .  
In its General Comment No . 5 ( 1994 ) on disability , the Committee defined the rights of persons with disabilities and made explicit reference to their right to physical and mental health , which implied the right to have access to , and to benefit from , those medical and social services that would enable them to sustain and reach their optimum level of independence and functioning .  
Quoting rule 4 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities , 4 the Committee stated that , in addition to the need to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to adequate food , accessible housing and other basic material needs , it was also necessary to ensure that support services , including assisting devices were available for persons with disabilities , so as to assist them in increasing their level of independence in their daily life and in exercising their rights .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The representative of Benin stated that a project to adopt a competition law in his country had been stopped when the West African Economic and Monetary Union , of which Benin was a member , decided on the adoption of a common competition regulation that would supersede competition laws at the national level .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
At the national level , the Service Centre for Human Rights Education , established in 1997 , continues to provide systematic assistance and advice to school teachers on human rights issues , including the development of special projects and of a newsletter .  Anti-racism educational efforts were also reported .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
Position required to address deficiencies in the level of resources dedicated to the Asia and Middle East region : provides support for the chief on financial management of peacekeeping offices in the Asia and Middle East region , actions day-to-day correspondence , monitors status of allotments reports , assists unit with general administrative and clerical functions , responsible for coordinating unit reporting exercises and compilation of information ( IMIS ) for analysis by the chief .  
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
Noting that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
The Refugee Education Trust , an independent fund established in December 2000 with strong support from United Nations agencies , donors , Governments and non-governmental organizations , is a mechanism designed to provide sustainable post-primary education , motivating refugee children to continue and complete primary schooling in the hope that they may return to their communities as teachers , professionals and leaders after obtaining the necessary skills at the post-primary level . 
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Four distinct functional elements are delineated ( peacekeeping best practices and policy , public information , gender and peacekeeping and the Resource Centre ) , for which 19 new posts are requested ( 13 Professional and 6 General Service ( Other level ) ) , in addition to the current staffing of 8 .  
The public expenditure level set under the national budget must ensure that the social and economic sectors are adequately financed , taking into account the absorptive and fiscal capacity of the economy over the medium term .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
The options for determining the level and timing of emissions reductions and limitations include international agreement on emissions and / or concentration levels and on how the effort will be equitably shared , programmes for technological development , national policies to affect the energy mix and associated investments , market-based and regulatory policy instruments , and voluntary action .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
From this perspective and in the light of the international momentum towards achieving universal accession to the Agencys safeguards regime , we are amazed at the position of certain countries that are active and influential in the field of non-proliferation , which occasionally adopt a negative attitude towards the need to attain universal accession to the safeguards system .  This clear contradiction demonstrates the lack of credibility of certain influential countries in dealing seriously with the countries that fail to comply with the principles now enshrined at the international level .  
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .  
The various measures agreed on , particularly the creation at the national , regional and international levels of strategies and plans of action , required widespread support to the countries involved in the struggle as well as the promotion at the international level of legal cooperation and strengthening of cross-border controls .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
For this reason , we are not bound by such wording and concepts contained in that document which , therefore , shall not entail any political or legal consequences and do not oblige us to take any preventive , legislative , judicial , administrative , regulatory or other measures at the national level .  
As reflected in table 1 below , the projected overall level of expenditures is currently expected to amount to $ 78.6-million , representing additional requirements in the amount of $ 975,700 over the provision approved to date for the additional activities , such as the extensive data cleaning and verification essential for the implementation of the payroll module , which were not fully foreseen .

Her delegation remained committed to participation in the special session at the highest political level , and to childrens participation in the planned local , national and international events , which would enhance the visibility of the session .  
Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;

Among the recommendations of the Secretary-General was the strengthening of the mandate of BONUCA in order to enhance its effectiveness and the visibility of its activities by increasing its resource capabilities , strengthening its administrative capacities and making available to the Office a level of resources commensurate with its revised mandate , namely , bringing about political dialogue and national reconciliation , monitoring the security situation , ensuring respect for and the promotion of human rights ; and providing political support for the mobilization of resources with a view to the economic reconstruction of the country .  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
For the first time in my countrys history , free and direct elections were held for the presidency of the Republic and at the local level to ensure administrative decentralization and to safeguard the common partnership of the people in assuming the burdens of comprehensive development .  
To this end , we have been including the subject of civic education in primary and secondary school curricula , and we have been developing large-scale civic campaigns to provide education at the national level about democratic values .  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;

Paragraph 26.9 stated that the level of resource requirements did not include any provision for the information activities associated with special meetings and conferences to be scheduled for the biennium 2002-2003 and that , should the Department of Public Information be required to carry out promotional and informational activities specific to those meetings and conferences , the necessary requirements would be sought through the presentation of statements of programme budget implications .  
To develop local , national and regional capacities through a lasting strategic alliance among all development actors so that advantage can be taken at the local level of the potential of globalization through an exchange of experiences and best practices within and between countries , the promotion of formal and informal education for national and local leaders , and support for applied research and technological innovation at all levels .  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
Recognizing the need to harness synergies and to create cooperation among the various Information and Communication Technologies initiatives , at the regional and global level , currently being undertaken or planned to promote and foster the potential of Information and Communication Technologies for development by other international organizations and civil society ,  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;

Reaffirms that the resident coordinator system is an important vehicle in the effective and efficient functioning of the United Nations system at the country level and a key instrument for the efficient and effective coordination of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system , and requests the United Nations system , including the funds and programmes , the specialized agencies and the Secretariat , to continue to provide support to the resident coordinator system ;  
Notes the progress achieved in the area of common premises and shared services at the country level within the United Nations system , recognizes the need to justify the pursuit of common premises on the basis of the adequate nature and size of the development cooperation programmes and projects , reaffirms the need to take fully into account cost-benefit studies as called for in relevant resolutions , and encourages further implementation of such initiatives , where appropriate , while ensuring that there will be no additional burden imposed on host countries ;  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours . 
Requests the relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including the specialized agencies , programmes , funds and regional commissions , as well as the World Bank and regional development banks , consistent with their respective mandates , to fully support the effective implementation at the national level of the Habitat Agenda and the Declaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in the New Millennium ;  
Together with the problem of anti-missile defence , the laying down in legal terms of the agreements reached on further radical , irreversible and verifiable reductions of strategic offensive weapons , in our opinion , down to the level of 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear warheads for each party is becoming particularly important under these circumstances .  
In the light of the evolving nature of the institutional support provided for the regional action programme in Asia , the Asian national focal points may agree on the modalities of reporting at the regional level , on the understanding that the task managers and hosts of the thematic programme networks of the RAP would draft the chapters of the regional report corresponding to their respective fields of activites .  
The claimant has also demonstrated a well-founded expectation of further business dealings with Iraq under ascertainable terms which were set out , notably , in the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention and in the quarterly billing statements exchanged between the parties , and that a consistent level of profits had been realized from these dealings .  
The denial of these claims in the E2 ( 3 ) instalment , however , reflected the failure of the claims to satisfy the evidentiary requirements of paragraph 11 of Governing Council decision 9 , as it was not established that a consistent level of profitability had been realized from the dealings in question nor that the alleged losses were a direct result of Iraqs invasion and occupation of Kuwait .  
Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
That measure could be based on the level of regular statistical activity within a country , an ongoing critical mass of survey-taking and statistical analysis , and the existence of basic elements of statistical infrastructure .  
However , as statistical capacity develops the technical standards that one may apply to any indicator may be increased : definitions may be refined and the quality of the indicator at a global level improved .  
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .

It has been learned that , last year , Sichuan 's procuratorial organs focused on investigating economic criminal cases involving leading cadres at and above the county and departmental levels ' state-owned enterprises , and 122 leading cadres were found to have been involved in major cases , of which 97 were at the departmental or bureau level .  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
The book on the " expositions of Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin on Ideological and Political Work " should be regarded as the basic teaching materials , fitted into the theoretical study for party committees at and above the regimental level and into the political education for the PLA units , and included in the political theoretical classes and study of colleges and universities .  The people should be organized to conscientiously study it .  Leading cadres , especially political cadres , should take the lead in studying and understanding these expositions well .  
Consumer demand is short for three main reasons : 1 .  Since reform and opening , while the absolute value of the income and consumption level of Chinese residents has been growing steadily , the ratio of our society 's gross product that is eventually used for consumption , or the final consumption rate , has been in a falling trend , with our accumulation or savings rate having tended to rise .  
It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
The import of advanced technology and varieties such as mechanized stockraising , enclosed fish-rearing , the processing , storage , and preserving of agricultural produce , foodstuff processing , covering young plants with plastic film , and introduction of fine seed strains has markedly enhanced the level of modernization of China 's agriculture and grain production .  
He stressed : Conducting the " Three Stresses " education at the county and city level is of great significance , because in our party 's organizational structure and the structure of state power , counties and cities are both leading organizations and basic units .  They play a pivotal role in forming a link between the provincial and central authorities on the one hand and the countryside , including townships and towns , on the other hand .  
Because the leadership posts at the county and city level are also schools to foster outstanding leadership talent , and because counties and cities have complete functions just as " the sparrow may be small but it has all the vital organs , " the posts are the most suitable places to temper cadres ; a considerable number of senior and medium-level leading cadres have grown to maturity after being tempered at such posts .  
For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .

and the major measures should conform to such requirements as strengthening macro-economic control and regulation , readjusting the structure of the economy , making sound arrangements for the state 's key constructions , taking earnest steps to improve the living standards of the people , enhancing the level of employment , providing sound social securities , and bringing about a sustainable growth . "

In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
A correct evaluation of the nature of growth in the economic returns of Liaoning �s state-owned industries will have a direct bearing on the choice of policy decisions for the next step of the reform of SOEs in Liaoning and even the whole nation .

It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .  The per capita GDP of the province in 2005 will reach the national average level in 2000 ; and will catch up with the national average level in 2010 , thus becoming an economically strong province in the western region .  
The glorious achievements we have made and the tortuous road we have gone through have proven , from positive and negative sides , that our use of scientific theory as guidance , our use of subjective reality as basis , and the continuous elevation of the Party 's level in policy theories and its ability to master the whole , are very important for the rise and fall of our cause .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .  
Training program should be enhanced .  We should help grassroots cadres in rural areas raise their awareness and abilities to lead the masses to readjust the economic structure , and to develop the rural economy , help them raise policy level , enhance legal system concept , change work style , particularly help them raise their levels and capabilities on the correct understanding and handling of the people 's internal contradiction in rural areas in the new period .  
Thanks to the achievements of modern science and technology , modern people enjoy a higher level of living standard .  Rapid progress has also been made in medical science .

Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
The small enterprises should take the road of being " specialized , refined , and unique , " establish their own competitive superiority , set up close ties of cooperation with the large enterprises , and heighten their level of socialized production .  
We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
It is even more important that in the 50 years since the founding of New China , particularly since the start of reform and opening up , the overall strength of our country has been remarkably enhanced , the people 's living standard is approaching a better-off level of moderate prosperity , and we have had a sufficient economic strength to increase our support to the Central Western Region ;  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Since reform and opening up , the living standards of the people in our country have been constantly improving and the actual incomes of urban and rural residents rapidly increasing .  With the remarkable improvement in living conditions , the problem of food and clothing for the people in the whole country has been basically resolved and they are now even marching toward the comparatively well-off level .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .

In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
According to a relevant leading official from the Ministry of Public Security , public security organs can fully and promptly prevent and discover security risks and loopholes in the construction and use of computer information systems through standardized , scientific , and fair assessments and supervision .  This will help to raise public security organs ' level of supervision and management of security protection for computer information systems .  
In the past half a century and more , Comrade Chen Yun 's philosophical thinking has helped resolved many major party and state affairs .  This has not only won my respect and admiration , but it has also made me realize deeply that at that time I was able to understand only its " application " aspect and did not approach it from the level of world outlook and methodology .  My understanding of it was very superficial .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
For this purpose , a " key construction project of military academies " will be activated , under which support will be given to the development of selected key areas with concentrated forces : Within 10 years ' time , about 10 military academies and a number of branches of learning are expected to reach or approach the advanced national level , among which some are expected to reach or approach the advanced international level ;  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Externally oriented economic development steered by " special economic zone " economics has played an important supporting role in the rapid rise of the east , and people have now reached a fairly high level of consensus on this point .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
On 18 May , at a report meeting on " three stresses " and " review and reexamination " among leading bodies at the municipal level , Jia Qinglin , member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee , required that party organizations at all levels of the municipality implement the " three represents " requirement set forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin in their firm and correct implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies and in the strict enforcement of party discipline .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
In recent years , although China 's army computer network has developed fairly quickly , the mutual connectivity between agencies at the regimental level and above has been realized in the majority of units .  However , this situation frequently occurs : As soon as operational training meets with emergency circumstances , computers are abandoned and a return to manual operations ensues , and the more fierce the struggle , the more willing one is to return to " re-operating old-style affairs . "  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
In light of the " three represents " requirements , party committees at and above the army level fully recognized the extremely great importance of changing the leadership style and getting involved with the masses .  They paid special attention to overcoming superficial work style , formalism , and failure to go down to the grassroots , stay there , and provide concrete assistance to the masses .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
The PLA General Political Department held a training course for the party secretaries of its directly subordinate units from 10 May to 15 June to conscientiously study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " .  The training course aimed to further improve the ideological level and the ability of leadership of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees , and to enhance the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the leading bodies of party committees .  
Even the leading cadres with workers ' or farmers ' backgrounds had raised their ideological and theoretical proficiency and knowledge and cultural qualities up to a considerable level through their diligent learning .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
Units at the military region level will establish offices composed of various functional departments to take charge of the training of reserve military officers .  Major duties of the offices are to organize and guide their subordinate units to select and train students of regular schools of higher learning , provide military and political training , and examine and recruit these students .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
in our country , social productivity , comprehensive national strength , and the people 's living standards were all raised to a higher and higher level ; gratifying reports came from all fronts ; our nation 's international status was obviously enhanced .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Chairman Jiang emphatically pointed out with a farsightedness : " To earnestly lay a solid scientific and cultural foundation among vast numbers of cadres of our army and raise their knowledge to a higher level is of tremendous significance to enhancing the entire army 's study and understanding of modern science and technology and particularly high-tech knowledge , to promoting the development and use of high-tech weaponry and equipment , and to creating new tactics . "  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
A constant flow of vast numbers of high-quality personnel with modern science and general knowledge into the army will further optimize the knowledge structure and greatly raise the scientific and cultural level of military cadre ranks , and will provide a strong knowledge , science and technology backing for army building .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
For example , last year , when discussing the measures for promoting community construction and management , advancing the construction of new and high-tech industrial bases , and reinforcing the party organizations at the grass-roots level , members of the municipal party committee standing committee were dispatched to do special investigations and research in the fields they took charge of .  This guaranteed that the decisions and arrangements made by the municipal party committee more relevant and pertinent in giving guidance to the concrete work .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .  Only by continuously improving itself , and making efforts to improve the mode of its leadership , can a local party committee really ascent a higher plain to look farther ahead and give thought to things more deeply ; and only thus can it better play a role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level .  
In the second half of 1995 , units at the grassroots level of the South China Sea Fleet stationed in the opening area of the special economic zone reflected that the original experience and methods of ideological and political work seemed to be unworkable now .  
The purpose of the " three stresses " education by positive examples conducted at the grass-roots level is to bring into play the role of grass-roots party organizations as fighting bastions and the role of party members as exemplary vanguards , pool together the strength of the vast numbers of officers and men , and provide a strong organizational and ideological safeguards for all-round construction of our grass-roots units and for meeting the requirements of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration " .  
On 29 June , Wang Han-ning , " deputy chief of staff and concurrently executive officer " , further pointed out at a news conference : The " Han Kuang-16 exercise " scheduled for mid-August is an annual training program which is directed at a possible enemy " attack on Taiwan " ; it is divided into three main parts : deduction from chessmen maneuvers ; simulated chessmen at and above battalion level in the combat theater , together with drills by a number of actual troops ;  
Participants unanimously held that Chairman Jiang viewed military logistical building in a new era from the angle of time and strategy , applied Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's ideology on military logistical building , scientifically analyzed new contradictions and problems in logistical work under a new situation , and guided the military to great progress in logistical adjustment and reform by integrating theory with reality .  As a result , the level of our logistical building has been raised markedly and a new trail for military logistical building with a Chinese characteristic has been blazed .  
Recently , this reporter went to a place in Hebei for assignment .  Arriving at the office of the county government , this reporter explained the intent of investigating and understanding some conditions reported by farmers .  The director of the county government office who received this reporter let out a long heavy sigh and said : " In recent years , our organizations at the grass-roots level have been weak .  The cadres dare not speak or take any actions .  The farmers are spoiled as a result . "  
They are satisfied only with their selfish desire and small farmer 's mentality .  They merely keep a close watch on the little bit of interests before their eyes , and set themselves against cadres .  It is outright impossible to carry forward undertakings at the grass-roots level . "  
Specifically , it is necessary to achieve actual effects in correcting the guiding ideology for work and overcoming the formalism , in enhancing the unit 's level of training the military with science and technology , in strengthening the ideological and political building of the unit , and in resolving the hot and difficult issues which have confounded the grass-roots level over a long period of time .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
This is aimed at helping party organizations further check , understand , and use cadres , discover and assist incompetent cadres , and make adjustments at an earlier stage .  Since August 1995 , Qingdao has implemented a probation system to place all newly selected and appointed leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level on probation .  The probation period is one year .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
Raising the scientific and cultural level of all the people is a huge systematic undertaking , one which requires painstaking planning and organization , and one which can not be left unemphasized , nor worse yet bogged down with the usual sighs of emotion .  
In order to realize this goal , we must conform to the requirements of " low level and wide coverage " and adhere to the principle of associating individual accounts with comprehensive coordination in society .  Employers and employees should share the expense for medical insurance at a reasonable rate .  On this basis , we must balance the rights and obligations of the insured , ensure the collection of premiums for medical insurance and probe for solutions to balance medical costs that exceed the maximum sum .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .  
Leading organs should regard it as their own duty to remove worries and resolve problems for the basic level , work out effective and operable measures , favor the basic level in their policy orientation , extend more timely support to the basic level when needed and refrain from gilding the lily for administrative organs at higher levels , constantly improve the conditions of material and cultural lives in basic-level units , and devote great efforts to creating an environment which can hold people 's hearts .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
Compared to the same period last year , among the 14 key industries , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronics , light industry , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries saw their profits increased and the power industry maintained a relatively high level of profitability .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
The scale of these building activities is large , and they have broad impact .  They have raised the level of civilization in the cities and the ethical quality of the citizens and played a positive promotional role for the stability of reform and development .  
Cadres at the detachment level are required to master the knowledge and the command skills on more than three arms of the services within the scope of the brigade , and to meet the requirement of " being proficient in the professional work on their own posts , getting to know the work on nearby posts , and gaining an intimate knowledge of the work on related posts " ;  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
To effectively solve this problem , the division has conducted research on simulated high-plateau oxygen-deficient training in light of training troops with science and technology in recent years , and has summed up a complete set of methods for physical training .  As a result , routine training has basically produced the actual results of similar training in places over 4,500 m above the sea level , where only half of the normal oxygen content is in the air .  
Besides , the armored units , the missile units , and other heavy equipment formed organic units to take part in the training for the first time in places over 5,000 m above the sea level on an average in the hinterland of the Kalakunlun Shan . The troops were tempered and their combat capability on plateaus under conditions similar to those of an actual combat was increased .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
It is party leaders who drew up the armed forces ' laws and regulations .  They have shaped and standardized the party 's basic principles for the construction of the armed forces , elevated these principles to the level where they become the will of the state , and used mandatory authority to ensure their implementation .  This is specifically an expression of consolidating and strengthening the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
As compared with the same period last year , among 14 major trades , metallurgical , petrochemical , machinery , electronic , light , textile , pharmaceutical , tobacco , and gold industries experienced increased profits .  Power industry continuously maintained a fairly high level of profit .  
In this regard , Zhang Li proposed that facing the situation of China 's accession to the WTO soon , the educational sector at the government level should take the work of research , exposition , and verification as a matter of great urgency , use the experience of the 40 countries that have joined the education trade agreement for reference , set up a special organ to coordinate pertinent departments , and begin the procedure of making initial preparations .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
Through making efforts over the last 20 years or so , we have eventually opened up a most lively , active , and creative ideological and political situation in the history of our party and country and the ideological level and understanding capability of the masses of people have been greatly increased .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
Building up the foundation and devoting effort to implementation are a process of endless circles and spiral ascent , which require repeated effort and effort at repetition .  However , this repetition is not simply a mechanical repetition on a low level ; instead , it requires that we should - - along with the deepening of reform , development of the situation , and the real situation of the units - - continuously adapt ourselves to new issues , study new problems and resolve new contradictions .  
It is a pity that the differences in history , culture and social systems , and the discrepancy in economic development level and values have influenced the Americans in their understanding of China . The US media have the habit of exposing the negative aspects of China , not reporting or reporting less on the positive ones , because the United States still has the arrogant complex of being a big country .  
In particular , efforts should be made to master the basic theory of Marxism and applying its position , viewpoints , and methodology , enhancing the level of proficiency in the theory of Marxism , guarantee the firmness of the political belief and the political position with the proficiency in theory , and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the ideal and belief .  
The ongoing vigilance education among our party and government leading bodies and leading cadres at and above the county level , which uses the negative examples of Hu Changqing , Cheng Kejie , and other major and typical cases as teaching material , is a major move we have taken to ensure the sound implementation of the guidelines put forward by the party Central Committee on running the party strictly .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
The party organizations at all levels must act in light of developments , proceed from the characteristics of leadership work at different levels and in different posts , and actively explore ways of exercising effective supervision over the leading cadres ; they should make efforts to enhance the level of supervision , to ensure that unhealthy trends are promptly and effectively discovered and corrected and that corrupt behavior is promptly exposed and deal with . 
seriously implement the general requirements that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily and must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support , and comprehensively promote army building ; resolutely abandon formalism and bureaucracy , make great efforts to encourage the style of seeking truth , doing solid work and going deep into reality , properly grasp all aspects of work , and constantly raise the revolutionization , modernization , and regularization of the armed forces to a new level .

At present , momentous economic globalization and new technology revolution have raised the economy of mankind to a higher level , and has also provided a rare opportunity for our country 's economy to reach the world advanced level .  On the other hand , with 50 years of accumulation and , especially , development of the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , we have acquired favorable conditions for accelerated development , in both objective and subjective terms .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
They sufficiently respected , trusted and supported brigades and regiments in executing their rights for independently administering grassroots units , and allowed brigades and regiments to have leading roles in devoting efforts to grassroots units .

and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
From ancient wars through cold-weapon wars and hot-weapon wars to modern mechanized wars and high-tech wars , what weapons to use when a country goes to war is not determined by the subjective will of man , but by the level of productive forces prevailing at the time .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .

This reporter has learned from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security that the current sustained growth of national economy can help create jobs ; however , as economic restructuring will be intensified , the number of workers laid off by state-owned enterprises is expected to remain at a fairly high level in 2001 .  Moreover , a noticeable increase in the numbers of new members of the work force and unemployed personnel directly seeking job in the labor market will bring considerable pressure on Chinese cities and country in employment this year .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the PLA training institutions at the postgraduate level built a number of key academies or schools ; developed a batch of key academic disciplines ; and set up a number of key laboratories as well , and this was a major decision made by the Central Military Commission .

It has made breakthroughs on and mastered a number of key technologies , closing our gap with the advanced world level , to develop a number of high-tech industrial growth-points .  It has sharply promoted China 's development of high technology and high-tech industry , providing high-tech support for upgrading traditional industry .  
China 's satellite project was developed under conditions where China 's basic industries were relatively weak , where the science and technology level was rather backward , and where the state finances were limited .  Through a long period of arduous struggle , by the end of the year 2000 , China altogether launched 48 different types of artificial satellites .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .

As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
This is really a sorrowful reality .  At a time when " the overall situation is set and it is not far away , " should we pay attention to the introduction of the WTO regulations and operational mechanism , rather than remaining at the level of shouting slogans , stirring up news , and analyzing advantages and disadvantages ?  Should we adopt a more rational , pragmatic , and scientific attitude ?

When selecting members of leading groups of people 's courts at the grassroots level , intermediate and higher courts should provide conscientious assistance to local CPC committees .  They must make sure to select them from excellent judges .  
At the ceremony of promoting military officers to the military and police rank of general on 21 June , Jiang Zemin made a special emphasis in his speech : In the year of the new century [ as published ] , cadres at the divisional-bureau level in all services and arms as well as all military scientific research institutes are required to attain the level of higher education and the level of possessing modern professional knowledge .

and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .

In addition , in its crackdown on Falungong , the Ministry of State Security will play the main role , instead of an assistant as before , thus showing that Falungong is regarded as the no . 1 enemy of the state and that the crackdown will escalate .  
Before the Spring Festival , in order to have the " study and education " activities aim at more definite objectives , the provincial party committee enlisted 20 cadres at the provincial level , 291 cadres at the prefectural and departmental levels , and 10,686 cadres at the county and section levels to go down to the grassroots units to conduct investigation and study , trying to feel out the mental conditions of the objects for the " study and education " activities and the conspicuous problems that must be resolved .

In the training and management of the athletes , serious attention should be paid to scientifically training their abilities in physique and athletic contests , and heightening their cultural level , mental quality , and moral standard ;  
Moreover , we should base ourselves on China 's realities and conscientiously sum up and utilize our own successful experience in training and managing our athletes on one hand and , on the other hand , persist in opening to the outside world , continue to draw on the good practices of foreign countries which are conducive to raising the level of our athletics , make full use of the modern science and technology to enhance the quality of training , and enable China 's athletics to attain a still greater development in the new century .

The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Market competition hinges , to a considerable extent , upon the quality and functions of products .  In order to implement the open strategy of pluralistic markets and " walking out , " it is imperative to concentrate our efforts on heightening the quality and grades of export commodities and enhancing their competitiveness , otherwise , it will be very difficult to guarantee the original market shares , and still more difficult to open up new international markets .  As a result , China 's level of opening to the outside world will be seriously impaired .  
It has been recently learned from a relevant department of the Central Organization Committee under the CPC Central Committee : China has basically completed organizational restructuring at provincial level .  China 's provincial governments have reduced 74,000 personnel , and the number of provincial government organizations has been reduced from 55 to 40 .  Party and government departments have internally streamlined and cut 20 percent of their subordinate organizations on average .  
According to the " Provisional Procedure , " military cadres at the divisional level and those who are below the battalion level and who have served in the military for less than 20 years will continue to be assigned jobs when transferred to civilian work .  The local party committees and governments concerned should be responsible for arranging jobs for these cadres .  
The amount of the pension should be calculated on the basis of 80 percent of the monthly pay , military-rank pay , plus the standard allowance of the military cadre at the level equivalent to the new civilian job and the total of basic and length-of-service wages in the military .  
They may be settled in the original places of their spouses or the location of their marriage .

Relying on the grassroots level party organizations , Ningxia clearly pointed out the focus of education , adopted the method of running study classes on the legal system , and conducted meticulous ideological and political education among the infatuated followers .  
In light of the principle of " uniting , educating , and saving the majority and following the law to attack the tiny minority , " the Ningxia party committee and government established the system of party and government chiefs holding overall responsibility and the leaders at each level assuming direct responsibility .  The regional party committee and government also assigned responsibility to the leading cadres at all levels .  Whoever slackens the work of transformation through supervision and education should be held responsible for negligence .

Luo Gan said : Over the past year , the procuratorial organs throughout the country conscientiously studied and worked hard to practice General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " continued to set strict demands on their work and the performance of their law enforcement duties , and obviously enhanced the level of fairness in law enforcement and improved the social image of the procuratorial personnel . 
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
We should guarantee the normal operation of political power at the grassroots level and establish a supervising and managing system for the reduction of peasants ' burdens .  We should continue to straighten up wanton collection of fees by middle and primary schools in rural areas , wanton collection of water and power charges in rural areas , apportioning of fees for newspaper , and demanding money and things for activities in order to achieve certain targets .  
However , after over 20 " tigers " at the provincial and ministerial level have been knocked down , the government has also been vigorously promoting clean government and giving important posts to those officials who are honest and clean and competent in fighting corruption .  Therefore , as soon as Zhang Guoguang took up the post of acting provincial governor of Hubei Province , he vowed : Whoever does not fight corruption should step down .  
Several decades of effort have brought dramatic changes to the Chinese countryside , and combined agricultural production capacity has taken several steps at a time consecutively .  After several thousand years , China 's troubling problem of feeding its people has finally been resolved and farmers ' lives overall have attained a level of relative comfort .  
Some awakened " Falungong " followers expressed their belief that " now that we are rid of Li Hongzhi 's spiritual yoke , we feel very relaxed , and feel that life is so beautiful , leaders at every level are so amiable and respectful , the Party and the government are so great and right . "  
For other international human rights treaties it has joined , the United States always made reservation , statements , and understanding to ensure that their implementation would be strictly limited within the scope of the US Constitution and other laws , and could only be applied to the federal level and could not be applied to various states .  As a result , the international covenants are a sheer sheet of meaningless paper in the United States .  
With the unremitting efforts over a long time , the Chinese people 's living standard has been unprecedentedly improved and the human rights and basic freedoms they enjoy have been raised to an unprecedented high level .  The human rights situation has reached its best period in history and this is a fact obvious to all .  
The committee members pointed out : With the successful fulfillment of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , our nation has basically solved the issue of providing sufficient food and clothing for the 1.3 billion people throughout the country , and the living standards of the people in the main have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .  The leaders of the five countries affirmed the steady development of bilateral trade with China , but also expressed concern over the existing problems .  For example , the volume of trade is not large enough ;  
While increasing their traditional commodity trade , the enterprises will also gradually expand economic and technological cooperation and reciprocal investments , and will especially advance their joint-venture cooperation in the high-tech field .  This will not only enhance the level of economic and trade cooperation and enrich the contents of cooperation , but will also bring about greater economic benefits to both sides .  This time , a batch of Chinese entrepreneurs with substantive economic strength joined the visit , and this won good comments from the five host countries .  
Meanwhile , with a view to successfully fulfilling the target of building up a regular , younger , and knowledgeable military , the Central Military Commission has recently selected and promoted from the basic level of all major military regions a group of forty-something cadres with university educational background and above to both the army and divisional levels , as a back-up force for the leading bodies of all major military regions .  
Today , when the 10th Five-Year Plan is formulated , the framework of a socialist market economy has been initially set up , the concept of building a market economy has struck deep roots in the hearts of people , the living standards of our people have basically reached a moderately high level , the supply of most commodities has exceeded their demand , economic globalization has become a major trend , China 's accession to the WTO is just round corner , and international competition is becoming increasingly acute .  
the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure . "  Today , the quality and efficiency of China 's economic development have both been enhanced to an unprecedentedly high level .  
From an international viewpoint , after a country 's GDP has increased to a certain level , it usually will slow down its economic growth to ensure stable and coordinated economic and social development .  
The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .  
We must change the method of simply considering structural adjustment as increasing or decreasing the acreage of crops , and avoid the practice of developing low level and redundant production and the situation of " everyone has the same thing . "  We should pay attention to keeping local characteristics of agriculture and develop and expand " advantageous crops while making improvements in primary production " so as to let peasants gain maximum benefits in the course of structural adjustment .  
Following the central authorities ' guideline , Fujian will take more effective measures to push Fujian-Taiwan economic and trade cooperation to a new level , seriously study the trend and requirements of Taiwan investment , study the plan and development strategy of the transfer of Taiwan 's technology-based industry to outside the island , seriously study measures needed to cope with the transfer of Taiwan 's high-technology industry , and double our efforts to lay down a plan on utilizing Taiwan capital by Fujian 's key industries .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Guangdong must continue to act on Comrade Jiang Zemin 's instructions , namely " creating new strengths and reaching a higher level . "  First of all , Guangdong must give play to its political , institutional , and geographical advantages and speed up changing the government functions and improving the market economic order so as to become the forerunner in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system .  
In view of our country , following the reform and opening up and economic construction for more than 20 years , the productive forces in our country have climbed onto a new stage , the system of socialist market economy has been initially established , the scale and level of opening up to the outside world have been greatly increased , the talented people of science and technology , management , and other specialized professions are growing rapidly , and a number of center cities with relatively stronger competitiveness have emerged in the coastal areas .  
We should use the information net and other advanced technological means to enhance the level of market management and take further advantage of the competitive strong points of commodity markets , while focusing on cultivating and developing markets for key elements such as capital , technology , and labor , so as to promote the rational flow of the key elements of production .  
Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
The system of leading cadres taking the blame and resigning should be comprehensively introduced .  Those leading cadres who are directly responsible for major cases of law or discipline violation should not only be given appropriate disciplinary penalties , but also offer to resign on their own initiative .  If such a person fails to tender his resignation himself , it is suggested that the people 's congress at the same level and its standing committee should dismiss or replace him .  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
County Chief Rou Zi Gu Li Ba Yi of Tashiku Erqiantajike Autonomous County said that within one year of the launching of the great strategy of developing the west , the county had strengthened cooperation with the eastern coastal region and turned ample resources into an economic advantage .  The strategy , he said , has already brought tangible benefits to the impoverished county located 4,000 meters above sea level on the Pamirs plateau that had been singled out to receive special government support .  
China 's current economic foundation has been transformed from a traditional planned economy into a socialist market economy .  Should its upper level not change ?  
We should continue to increase investment in education , ensure the basic need in promoting compulsory education in rural areas , support the construction of foundation facilities for schools of higher learning , develop middle and high level professional education , strengthen vocational and technical training , and encourage people in the society to run schools .  
It demonstrated that provincial and ministerial level officials are no longer " above being punished . "  Yet regretfully , big cases keep cropping up , becoming just as Hu Angan , an expert on national conditions , describes it , " more and more rampant , like an infectious disease . "  
At the meeting of the Anhui delegation , deputies Wang Taihua , Meng Fulin , Zhao Shucong , and Xu Li aired their respective views on developing democracy and strengthening the building of the legal system at the grassroots level , increasing peasants ' income and reducing their burden , and improving work style .  
The Henan Provincial Party Committee has decided to start with members of its standing committee , to start with organs under the provincial authorities , and to start with all levels of leading cadres .  Let the higher authorities set an example to their subordinates .  We must guide vast numbers of cadres , so that they would devote their energies to improving their ideological level and work capability ;  
Xu Youfang said : As long as we maintain a sober understanding , fix our positions accurately , take positive action , and make full preparations , we can certainly seize hold of the opportunities brought by the WTO entry , surmount all sorts of possible difficulties , and push the national economic and social development forward to a new level during the 10th Five-Year Plan period .  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
Third , the urban and rural structure will be adjusted , the process of urbanization will be advanced steadily and positively , the rate of urbanization in the whole province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
Fifth , the structure of the personnel training will be adjusted .  While basic education is consolidated , high school education and tertiary education will be developed greatly .  The rate of tertiary education receivers in Henan Province will be raised to a level close to the national average .  
In the next five to 10 years , Guangxi will increase the number of cities , will strengthen the cities ' ability to gather various production factors and promote economic and social development in their surrounding areas .  The size of existing large and medium cities will be appropriately expanded .  The infrastructure facilities there will be improved and strengthened .  The level of urban planning , urban construction , and urban management will be further enhanced .  
The deputies unanimously stated : More attention should be given to building political and legal affairs institutions at the grassroots level in remote border areas , and to heightening overall quality of political and legal affairs workers at the grassroots level as well .  
During the discussion , the deputies unanimously stated : Over the past year , the " two supremes [ the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate ] " have strengthened judicial work in an all-round way ; have intensified legal supervision , deepened reform , or made redoubled efforts to build a contingent ; have pressed ahead with court reform or procuratorate reform at the grassroots level by firmly keeping in mind the overall interests of party and state work ; and have thus made fresh headway in all sorts of work .  
should firmly and unremittingly tackle problems like impure thinking or erroneous styles among personnel concerned ; and should attach great importance to professional training for judges or procurators at the grassroots level by ensuring the greatest support for them in this regard , and by choosing and assigning the best teachers for them as well .  In order to heighten overall quality of judges or procurators , we must work hard for several years to come .

Currently , the electro-mechanical audible traffic signals are set to broadcast at fixed sound levels in all directions day and night .  While the sound must be loud enough for the visually impaired to hear during the daytime , the same output level can disturb nearby residents at night .  
Mr Li said the eATS with its new features - - ambient noise responsive output , directional output , and tactile signal - - would not only make road crossings safer for the visually impaired but also reduce noise disturbance to a minimum .  The sound level of the new eATS was decided after consultations with the visually impaired and people who live near signalized crossings .

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials .

They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
High mountains , clear water , slithering fish , skittering shrimp : Shanmeiis primarily situated on a slope at about 500 meters above sea level . The junction of the Tsengwen River and its tributary the Tanayiku River is just nearby . The area is densely packed with trees , with a pervasive sense of nature ; the clear , sweet river water is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation for the villagers .  
" Star " level personalities with attractive faces and sleek bodies would cooperate with a professional photographer to produce a series of carefully calculated shots . These would be published as " personal albums " wrapped in clear plastic ( they could only be thumbed through after purchase ) , and provided as products for the enjoyment of movie stars ' and singers ' fans .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
Building the ideal of " equal and mutually beneficial relations " : In fact , following the inaugural visit of high-level US or European officials by the French Minister of Industry in January of 1991 , in these two years there have been no less than 50 visits by European or American officials ranked at the vice-minister level or above . Most of them came to Taiwan under the rubric of unofficial participation in privately sponsored conferences on bilateral economic cooperation , and did n't play up their visits along the way .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Established during the period of Japanese occupation , the Ho Cheng Group ( HCG ) is an old , well-known native Taiwanese company . In its first 50 years of operations , from the boss to the lowest level of workers , all were pure " fellow Taiwanese . " That is up until 198l , when a seemingly rather naive " mainland lad " broke the provincial circle .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs . Dogs were the first domestic animals to be reared by humans , and were not only intimately involved in people 's daily lives on a prac tical level , but were also an indispensable part of life on the spiritual plane .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
On the other side of the bridge , the road climbs an embankment and approximately one hour later enters a tunnel and passes through to the quintessential stretch of road skirting the Chulu Cliffs . At a height of 770 meters above sea level , the view is astonishing and vast ; the quality of the road is excellent .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid . After sorting the wheat from the chaff , Bartok incorporated the folk songs into his own works , thus not only creating a unique personal style , but also preserving folk music and raising it to a higher artistic level .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
In the past , the SEF distinguished between negotiations at the levels of chairman , secretary-general , and vice-secretary-general , and the SEF official of a given level would only negotiate with a mainland counterpart at the same level . Now , in order to increase flexibility , there will not be hard and fast distinctions between the levels . Moreover , in the past there were only negotiations on limited issue areas . Now there will also be sub-units discussing economic and cultural affairs . "  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
Over a thirty year period Taipower steadily developed new power plants until by 1986 , it had accumulated a margin reserve of 50% ( well above the normal level of 20% ) . Taipower was constantly running deficits , and at that point was criticized by the MOEA for wasteful investment . The margin reserve then began to decline as demand increased , until it reached only 4.7% during peak-demand hours last summer .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
At the most basic level , people can get away with this when representing deceased heroes of the past for whom there is no photographic record . But for modern subjects whose photos are available , such inferior work is an insult to viewers , bringing to mind the expression , " It 's easy to portray a ghost , hard to portray a man . "  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Their settlement was very large , and the burial patterns ( e.g . the direction in which the coffins are set ) are regular and orderly . During the test dig , traces were found of holes for pillars for house frames . In some places the cultural level is flat and even , without artifacts . " The dirt has been tramped down firmly and evenly , as if a large number of people walked over it , " says Liu , suspecting that such places may have been areas of collective activities for Tamalin Man .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
The clock tower 's main structure comprised three levels . The upper level bore an armillary sphere , used for astronomical observations ; on the middle level was a celestial globe , which displayed the movements of celestial bodies ; while on the bottom level were wooden mannikins which struck the time of day . The whole formed " a single mechanism , turned by the power of water , without human effort . "  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
Again , Xue Baocha should have made an ideal wife for the son of a family of high standing , but because she is unable to communicate with Jia Baoyu on a spiritual level , although she gains social rank , she finds no sympathetic resonance , but instead only a cold , empty shell .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
In this sort of cultural tradition , even if many contemporary women and their husbands enjoy a substantial level of educational achievement and income , when these women return to their motherinlaw 's house , they still come down a notch , afraid of offending at every turn , making their inlaws unhappy and causing trouble for their husbands .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
Shrines are everywhere on the broad yellow ground . There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
In Western music , perhaps it 's only the composer who is creative , while all the rest are interpreters . In Chinese music , the creators are at every level , and the performers are especially important creators . It is " homogeneous evolution , " " looking for difference in homogeneity , looking for similarity in difference , " " common appreciation of the elite and the popular , stressing commonality over difference . " These seem to be simple , ordinary descriptions , but this is its real nature .  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
Without a degree , they ca n't become teachers . And the special coaching program has been discontinued . Many weightlifting instructors at the primary level are serving in the guise of " substitute teachers . " These primary-level teams are the training ground for " fresh troops " for the national team in the future .  
It is said that his main contribution was to cut down the large trees that shaded the grand avenues for the nouveaux riches , level the dwellings that had stood between them , smooth off the hill tops to make them into gentle slopes , and turn the rectangular lakes and canals into irregular expanses of water and small streams . Then he would make a snaking path on the expanse of grass and let loose a flock of sheep of just the right number .  
In future , a nine-member commission , nominated by the premier and named by the president , and a consultative assembly will oversee whatever activities still remain for the downsized provincial government . County and municipal level executives and assemblies will continue to be popularly elected .  
" If developed according to plan , this will be the best industrial zone in the world , " says Enrique Lai . Fort Davis is blessed by verdant scenery and level terrain ; it is a modern town surrounded by unspoiled wilderness , and yet only fifteen minutes by car from downtown Colon , and ten minutes from the Colon Free Trade Zone .  
Although its strivings have produced no small number of impressive works , many of the generation 's artists have yet to come completely into their prime-particularly in regard to manifesting the " full human potential " sought by traditional literati ink painting . Many of the most famous painters were 80 to 90 years old before attaining a level of maturity that allowed them to express their deepest sentiments in their work at will .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
Although under the pens of literati since the Tang and Song , this fairy visitor among flowers had been washed clean of all connection with the vulgar mortal world , for the common people the osmanthus symbolized gold and jade , fame and fortune , and success at every level in the imperial examinations . So in the end even the literati could not escape the mundane .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
" Having aboriginal peoples making their own videos involves the problem of interpretation , " says documentary maker Li Tao-ming . In the past , outsiders often arrived with preconceived dichotomies like " mainstream vs . non-mainstream , or privileged vs . disadvantaged . They saw themselves as being in charge of the documentary effort , of being at a higher level than the subjects . This type of thinking must be smashed .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Commenting on the results of this most recent meeting of APEC , Sung Chen-chao , a professor in the graduate institute of political economy at National Cheng Kung University , states that APEC has difficulty reaching decisions because it acts by consensus rather than by majority vote . The increase in the number of participating nations means that differences in economic level have also increased . Some of the organization 's less developed members are facing pressures which make it difficult for them to embrace the liberalization of economics and trade .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
The books say , for example : " When the qi reaches the fingertips , the fingertips grow warm and begin to tingle , as if there were ants crawling over them . " These idiosyncratic descriptions are enlightening , but might it not be possible to measure these phenomena with scientific instruments ? It is also reported that when one reaches a certain level of proficiency in martial arts , one sometimes experiences uncontrollable twitching and jerky movements , due to spontaneous movement of the qi .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
As the coastal region continued to thrust upward , the shallowest sections of coral reef rose above sea level , resulting in a layer of limestone . This rock has been mined for many years by the cement industry , but has begun to be depleted in recent years .  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
This led to the questions getting more and more difficult . It was the sole basis for determining educational advancement , but it was completely removed from the basic educational level . What we want to do is to expand the base . " As long as the schools put the emphasis on imparting basic knowledge , then they will be meeting the goal of the reforms .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Relations with the mainland at the highest political level have reached impasse after impasse , and dark war clouds gather over the Taiwan Strait ; yet at the grassroots level , what with trade links , fishing links and intermarriage , the people are inseparably intermingled , and the same is true on the academic , cultural and religious fronts and even in the entertainment and travel industries .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
A : The original work itself is a highly ambitious novel , and a very successful one too . There is a sort of " sympathetic resonance " in this book between the uncertain social status of homosexuals and the uncertain international status of Taiwan itself . This resonance carries the significance of the novel to a higher level . Notes of a Desolate Man goes beyond mere description of the love lives of homosexuals .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
These ideas affected the ways in which writers chose to present knights-errant in their novels . Says Lin , " At the most fundamental level , knights-errant are supposed to embody moral virtue . So while a writer might allow his hero to be less than perfect in some small ways , he will always stand fast when faced with an issue or choice of consequence . "  
To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift . The problem was that the disaster covered such a vast area and came so quickly . Many mudslides and flash floods came with little or no warning , so that people could only watch helplessly as their loved ones were swallowed up or swept away , to be parted from them forever .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped . Underground parking-lots became underground reservoirs , and flooded transformer boxes blew out , cutting off electricity and water supplies to many buildings . In one dreadful incident , someone actually drowned while trying to get downstairs by elevator .  
On a more concrete level , points of consensus included : Mainland investment policy will be guided by the principle " proactive opening , effective supervision . " This marks the end of the era of " no haste , be patient . " In the future , a schedule will be established for allowing investment in mainland China for specific sectors and products .  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
" If Taiwan could elect a president like former British prime minister John Major , whose highest educational attainment was graduation from primary school , perhaps only then will the perverse custom of everyone trying to advance to a higher level of education gradually disappear , " says Chou . With a shake of her head and a sigh , Chou says that the deconstruction of social values will require a great deal of time .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
" Personal e-papers cover everything . It 's hard to imagine sometimes , but there are the minimum number of subscribers for all kinds of bizarre stuff , " says Sean Fu , CEO of the Internet Research Company , Maillist 's parent firm . For example , Maillist has even attracted more than 100 web users from mainland China to set up e-papers , some of which are devoted exclusively to attacking the idea of Taiwan independence , and even these are able to maintain the basic level of a hundred or more subscribers .  
If it is easy to find a free e-paper that is similar , or if the readers do n't really need the content , it is difficult to achieve the level of appeal required to collect fees , " says Hsu . But it can be done . Currently , e-papers at PChome that do the best with subscriber fees are for language learning and industrial reports . The publication with the most subscribers is iThome , a computer report , with about 10,000 .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
Individuals all have their own particular cultural background and value system . For that reason , the idea that prospective mates should come from similar economic and social backgrounds is not medieval . Most books on marriage include detailed " compatibility " checklists covering everything from ethnicity to where the two people live , their economic standing and level of education , how they interact with their own families , their respective personalities , interests and health , and what they hope for out of life .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
And can one who is so in tune with the beat of the universe be equally engaged on a personal level with those about her ? When talk turns to love and friendship , Flor de Loto is unreserved as usual . Popular as a child , she was the object of no little admiration after going to Spain . But her full social life simply enabled her to pour all the more energy into her dancing , without feeling as though she were missing out in other areas of life .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
At the end of April , Huang Jung-tsun reported the latest developments in elementary and junior high school English education to the Legislative Yuan . He emphasized that the MOE has consistently opposed the teaching of English at the first and second grade level . Furthermore , he warned that schools who persist in teaching English to first and second graders would automatically be disqualified from receiving any MOE subsidies in the future . Presumably , if these schools have the resources to hire the extra teachers , then they are not in need of government assistance .  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
In terms of literary value , Wang Dan 's essays do not come up to the same level as his poetry . But for the ordinary reader , in contrast to the more obscure poems the essays seem to offer a more accessible point of entry for understanding the soul of the exile . This is despite the fact that it is quite obvious that Wang carefully works to preserve his private space .  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
The Nationalist government took over from the Japanese the hospitals and basic level public health services . It also began to set up its own health centers in rural townships , while in villages in more remote areas and mountains it set up health offices that were locally responsible for such things as diagnosis and treatment , control of infectious diseases , mother-child health , hygiene education , environmental and school hygiene , etc . The government thus set up a pyramid-shaped public health system .  
It had withdrawn from the United Nations and diplomatic ties with Japan had been severed . Along with the political debate , a wave of nativization swept through every level of Taiwanese society . Within the literary community , a reevaluation of the Modernism it had adopted with Westernization was unavoidable .  
After his understanding of the limits of the tensile and torsional strength of eggs , he used the principle of the screw to fashion an interlocking ring of five eggs . After grasping the unique qualities of eggs , he pushed his skill to a new level by nesting a set of eight different sized eggs each within the other resulting in what looked like the traditional multi-layered balls carved from elephant ivory . He called it " Lost in Dense Clouds . "  
Unlike Hsinchu 's experimental primary and middle schools , which are under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Yuan 's National Science Council , STSIP 's public primary and middle schools are covered by the Tainan County Bureau of Education , and are ranked at the same level as all public primaries , enjoying no special privileges .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
Another said that the main consideration in the quantity and quality of arms sold to Taiwan would be the extent of the Chinese threat , and that in both quantitative and qualitative terms the US would endeavor to help Taiwan maintain a defense capability at a level proportionate to China 's national power .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
Due to Taiwan 's unique geographical position and diverse alpine terrain , as well as the numerous avenues for the immigration of new species-including transport by ocean currents , settlement by migratory birds , the mass migration of species during the ice age when Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were connected-the high level of biodiversity on the island greatly exceeds that of any other place on Earth .  
Although most people think that physicians who perform abortions encourage abortions or benefit from them , according to Jeng Cherng-jye most obstetric gynecologists do not urge their patients to get an abortion . On the contrary , most physicians urge pregnant underage women , be they married or not , to give serious consideration to carrying their pregnancy to term . Sometimes , a doctor will actually succeed in getting through to his patient on an emotional level and persuading her to keep the child .  
While continuing to work in the classical field , Lee also turned his attention to pop music . He could n't stand the schmaltzy love tales that characterized Mandarin pop lyrics , and he always found the music itself excessively influenced by Japanese teeny-bopper styles . Thus he took his background in academic music and plunged headfirst into the vulgar world of pop , determined to refine the genre and bring it to a higher level .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
Last year , he set out on a six-month , two-person expedition down the Amazon to the sea in an unmotorized craft . " I prepared relentlessly , " he said when interviewed by the National Geographic Channel . " We 're not nuts . " His preparations included measuring the depth of water in rapids , estimating when the rise in the water level would reach them after storms upstream , determining what conditions would force them from the river , how to avoid being infected by insect bites , and so on .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) .

Changhua City has a long history , but now it seems to have hit a wall , unable to get beyond its current population level or its geographical limitations , stuck running second to Taichung . But the past was different . Old Changhua once held the spotlight , especially its train station . A popular rest stop in the long north-south train journey , the station made a huge impression on all who visited it , and was the pride of Changhua .  
Rebellious spirit and modern Taiwanese literature aside , Mt . Pakua and the Changhua Big Buddha are the most common images people have of Changhua . Mt . Pakua in particular , thanks to its featuring in history so prominently , and the number of stories it 's involved in : rebelling against the Qing dynasty , fighting the Japanese , being the site of a military base . . . the peak , over 400 meters above sea level , features in many a heroic tale .

It became evident that the association was far more complex than assumed in the past , since it has been established to be contingent upon level of development , social structure and cultural milieu .  
Moreover , at the international level , prospects for achieving adequate , predictable , new and additional financial flows to developing countries for sustainable development are fraught with many challenges .  
They stressed the need for a multisectoral approach and for diagnostic assessment of the current institutional arrangements and human resources capacity at the national level as a basis for formulating strategies for the future .  
These estimates provide for a total of 354 military observers , 6,226 military contingent personnel ( out of an authorized level of 6,625 ) , 128 civilian police observers , 243 international civilian staff , 200 United Nations Volunteers and 500 local staff .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the channelling of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
The potential for achieving universal iodization of processed salt in the region is high and will be pursued vigorously at the national level and through coordinated intercountry initiatives with the support of the Regional Office .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
Inequitable distribution of resources , irrational duplication and overlapping of functions , limited authority at the local level , and uncoordinated efforts between public , private , voluntary and nongovernmental organizations still dominate the urban scene .  
The Netherlands has decided that , as a national objective , the maximum permissible chemical risk level for the public and the environment must not be exceeded by the year 2000 .  
Moreover , at the international level , there is no clear evidence as yet of the provision of adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in particular to developing countries , for sustainable development .  
Capacitybuilding , training , regional and international cooperation and information exchange along with a strong coordinating body at the national level seem to have been common primary requirements by developing countries .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction management and supervisory tasks .  
While the initial methodological work involved should be carried out at the international level , it could be envisaged that experimental applications and statistical data collection and analysis be subsequently undertaken in a regional context .  
The initial requirement would be to bring UNAVEM II rapidly to its previous level of 350 military observers , 126 police observers and 14 military medical staff , with an appropriate number of international and local civilian staff .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
An initial investment in social organization at the local level is followed by financial support to implement certain key communal projects which respond to priority needs identified by rural communities themselves .  
It is estimated that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
It meets annually , at the Heads of Government level , to develop collective responses on a wide range of regional issues , including trade , economic development , civil aviation and maritime issues , telecommunications , energy and political and security matters .  
At the practical level , a multilateral dialogue should be undertaken on issues which all the countries of the region are prepared to take up in the spheres of economic , environmental , cultural and humanitarian cooperation .  
Measures should be taken to ensure wide dispersal of educational facilities across geographical space , at least up to the secondary school level , so that access of all women living in remote and rural areas is fostered .  
Research , understood as " careful search or inquiry , course of critical investigation " , " a systematic search for facts " , 3 / is and should continue to be a basic and generic activity at the same fundamental level as analysis and writing .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
The cooperation currently being developed at the international level in the political and economic fields could only be effective if accompanies by strengthened international policies and actions in regard to social matters .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific , medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand ,  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) has been impeded by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , mainly at the local level , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
In the light of the foregoing and in spite of the amounts held in suspense , starting with General Assembly resolution 34 / 9 E , the financial burden on troop contributors has not so far been alleviated owing to the high level of outstanding contributions .  
Although statements were made at the rhetorical level , to his knowledge there had never been an operational attempt to give content to economic , social and cultural rights , nor to include them in overall strategies or specific objectives pursued .  
The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights had requested States parties to establish basic benchmarks at the national level for achieving essential minimum levels of satisfaction of each individual economic , social and cultural right .  
Concerning the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , it was often stated that the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights was too vague to be of operational significance .  
In the interests of social and economic development at the global level , the international community must not forget the victims , once it had addressed the urgent political dimensions of such conflict .  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
Each national focal point shall , as well , serve as a conduit for the channelling of international and regional input , information and support to the local and grassroots level in their respective countries ;  
At the intergovernmental level , it had become widely recognized that the drug problem could not be tackled on a unilateral or even a bilateral basis but , being global in nature , would require extended and improved international cooperation .  
His delegation encouraged the relevant United Nations agencies to contribute to the SystemWide Action Plan , which would be greatly enhanced by agreement on shared goals leading to concrete operational activities at the field level . 
At the theoretical level , it was more logical for an international judicial body which was impartial , independent and representative of the international community to make such a determination .  
It also confirmed the importance of a complementarity of economic , social , educational and information measures at the national level , including legislative , administrative and penal measures , and of measures taken at the international level .  
From that amount , OPS proposes that the operational reserve be established ( proposed Regulation 8.3 ) with an initial level set at 20 per cent of the annual UNOPS administrative budget , rounded to the nearest hundred-thousand dollars .  
Those services , which included advice and material assistance , were provided through social welfare ministries and bodies , and were not only offered at the national level , but also extended to friendly and fraternal States .  
Given the low level of voluntary contributions , it would also be desirable to prioritize training programmes based on their comparative advantage and to develop high quality programmes in cooperation with relevant national and other institutions .  
A refugee , the Chairman maintained , was the helpless victim of the breakdown of the social contract and blatant evidence of political or diplomatic failure at the regional or international level .  
In the absence of alternative hospital facilities readily accessible to refugees at more economical costs , the continual increase in the cost of services at private contracted hospitals made it impossible for the Agency to maintain its existing level of services without application of strict measures , including rationalization of referrals , reduction of the number of bed-days contracted and introduction of a system of cost-sharing for specialized hospital care .  
In addition , temporary expedients such as putting " cold " surgery on waiting lists , making real reductions in services in some fields , such as paying for surgery and not internal medicine , and reducing the level of reimbursement of patients ' hospital bills and " capping " the total amounts have all been applied .  
Among their many and varied activities , United Nations information centres continued to play a pivotal role in promoting the Organization 's major conferences on development questions during 1994 by raising the level of local interest in the issues and keeping the media and public informed .  
Since national legislation varies from country to country and , in practice , the borderline between licit and illicit arms transfers may not always be apparent , measures conducive to [ harmonizing ] [ achieving common ] laws and / or regulations and procedures , [ as well as the means of enforcing them , ] should be developed at the international level to ensure effective control over the acquisition and transfer of weapons .  
Further , the Assistant Secretary-General noted that the problems produced by rapid urbanization could not be solved by a single level of government ; it required close collaboration between all levels of government and the entire spectrum of civil society .  Of special importance were local authorities , and in that connection , the Assistant Secretary-General made reference to the recently signed " Protocol of Lisbon " between the Centre and prominent international local-government associations .  
At every level local , national , regional , international and global there is an awareness that the United Nations , for all its setbacks , is recognized for having done so much , so well and in such a short span of time .  
We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
Geographically located near the so-called golden triangle , Thailand has consistently supported , at both the global and the regional level , international efforts aimed at the prevention , control and suppression of narcotic drugs .  
Upon signing the agreement on the peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would recognize each other within their internationally recognized borders and diplomatic relations between these two States would be established at the ambassadorial level .  
The point is that , in such cases , there should be a minimum level of safeguards , through the application of a set of agreed , uniform rules and procedures , in order for the imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a manner that strikes a balance between , on the one hand , the interests of the international community and , on the other , the extent of the human suffering endured by peoples on whom the sanctions are imposed .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
The United Nations system has proven to be a major mechanism at the international level , creative enough to put a common vision and a common approach into effect through multilateral cooperation combining collective action with respect for national sovereignty .  
Our economy , although subject to the blockade , will grow and will provide for and meet the most pressing needs of our people .  The powerful infrastructure that we have built up over three decades with what some have called the subsidy that Cuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of education and culture and a stable land of peace and order .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
A top priority of the programme has been the objective of eradicating poverty from the world as well as the commitment , on the national level , to take decisive action and on the international level to cooperate in the common endeavour to achieve that objective by focusing , both in policies and in action , on dealing with the root causes of poverty and on satisfying the human needs of all .  
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
In this connection , we are continuing at the State level to formulate plans to minimize the consequences of the accident at Chernobyl improving living standards , increasing medical services and implementing special measures to lower radiation levels in the population with a view to removing limitations on peoples ' lives and activities in the contaminated regions .  
In our view , the key to improved coordination of humanitarian response at the international level lies in timely information - sharing , effective planning , accountability and transparency .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s recommended a minimum annual level of $ 30-billion in net official assistance in 1992 if an average annual growth of real gross national product of at least 6 per cent was to be achieved by the year 2000 .  
In order to boost such development and lasting stability , there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by the international organizations and specialized agencies within the United Nations system , coupled with broader and more intensive cooperation at a regional level .  
At the international level , it was agreed to focus attention on and support the special needs of countries and regions in which there are substantial concentrations of people living in poverty and which , therefore , face serious difficulties in achieving social and economic development .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
The priority objectives of guaranteeing the social protection of the individual , promoting his social integration and guaranteeing social peace and harmony can not be attained without a firm political will to invest at the national level , but also at the international level , in the well-being of all .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
The Secretary-General of the United Nations , in his report on the three Regional Centres , contained in document A / 50 / 380 of 25 August 1995 , recognized and strongly emphasized the importance of the role that such institutions can play in drawing up , at the regional level , confidence-building measures , measures to strengthen social and political stability and the security of States , and to help in the limitation and neutralization of existing arsenals .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in the Professional category , especially in posts at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and sending forward more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , the specialized agencies and the regional commissions ;  
Supports the request made by the Committee at its twelfth session for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fifteenth session , and recommends that the request made by the Committee at its fourteenth session to hold two sessions in 1996 , each of three weeks ' duration , be considered favourably , within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
First , it would be very useful if each committee responsible for ensuring the implementation of an international human rights instrument , in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights and the necessary experts , issued a document specifying , on the one hand , those legislative norms which were contrary to the provisions of the instrument in question and , on the other hand , those which were most conducive to its implementation at the national level .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
At national and provincial levels , water supply and environmental sanitation policies will be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization , while at the county level , programmes will be implemented to increase access to adequate quantities of water , improved latrine construction and hygiene education .  
In addition , the Declaration stated that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development required effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level .  
For others , emphasizing those rights was almost a pretext for relegating to a secondary level rights which constituted the common ethical standard of mankind : the right to life , to freedom of expression , equality before the law , free choice of representatives , etc .  
Even though contraceptive prevalence also rose rapidly over the same period - from 7 per cent to 33 per cent of married women - and the total fertility rate fell from the extremely high level of about eight children to about 5.5 , the number of unwanted births per woman actually increased from approximately one to two births .  
In 1993 , UNFPA organized a thematic evaluation of family planning services in eight countries to assess the quality of such services along six dimensions : choice of methods ; technical competence of service providers ; level of information and counselling available to clients ; nature of interpersonal relations between service providers and clients ; the presence of mechanisms within the programme to promote continued contraceptive use ; and the appropriateness and acceptability of services .  
The paper proposed specific approaches to topics perceived as sensitive or controversial ; called for new ways to select key concepts and set priorities ; and stressed the importance of ensuring that course content was clear and appropriate to both the socio-cultural context of the country and the age level of the students .  
The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
They considered educative measures and publicity as most important to curb the level of violence against women and asked whether particular programmes existed to deal with the problem of violence against particularly marginalized groups , such as refugee , poor and disabled women .  In reply to further questions , the representatives stated that assault and battery , whether committed inside or outside the home , could be prosecuted without the consent of the victim .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .  
She indicated that the choice of method was directly linked to location ( urban or rural ) and to the level of education , with women living in urban areas and with a high level of education tending to choose modern methods . 
The representative informed the members of the Committee that the Government of the Russian Federation , having realized that the monetarist underpinning of the first wave of economic reform provided only a limited set of social protection measures , had emphasized the provision of a proper level of social protection as the main requirement for the continuation of economic reform .  
Replying to a question on the role of women in economic and social decision-making and the integration of their concerns into economic and social planning , the representative , referring to the fourth periodic report , informed the Committee that women in the Russian Federation were not adequately represented at the decision-making level .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , both at the national and the international level , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Nothing short of a renewed and massive political will , at the national and international level , to invest in people and their well-being will achieve the objectives of social development .  
Certain countries have developed systems of ecological zoning , which they are using as a basis for identification of threatened ecosystems and development of ecological modelling at various levels , from the regional and national to the level of individual natural habitats . 
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
At a time when national security should be seen more and more in the context of military and political stability at the regional and international levels , the time had come to apply the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments .  
As indicated elsewhere , there is growing cooperation with non-governmental organizations , building on the role assigned to them in Agenda 21 in relation to activities at the country level , and with centres of excellence and academic institutions , in recognition of the cross-cutting nature of desertification control , involving the social , cultural , economic and physical management of a territory .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
WMO also organized jointly with EPPO and NAPPO symposia and workshops to give practical training in the use of meteorological data in the fight against pest and diseases , in reducing the level of undesired chemicals and in improving the quality of agricultural produce .  
Violence was seen as a vicious circle repeating itself from generation to generation but one that was not irreversible and that could be addressed through multidisciplinary cooperation at the national level , greater condemnation of violence against women and children reflected in criminal justice systems , and programmes to prevent violent behaviour and provide better treatment for victims .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
States participating in regional arrangements or agencies are encouraged to consider the possibility of using or , where appropriate , establishing or improving at the regional level procedures and mechanisms for the early detection , the prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes , in close coordination with the preventive efforts of the United Nations ;  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
The report recommended four main areas of future focus at the macro level : advising on social objectives and the efficient handling of the economy ; creating productive employment ; revamping the agriculture sector ; and strengthening the national database to measure social progress .  
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Supports the request of the Committee at its twelfth and thirteenth sessions for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow for the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions , and recommends that the request made by the Committee for additional meeting time be considered within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Through various national , regional and global level expert consultations and conferences that involve the public and private sectors and non-governmental organizations , FAO has been increasing the awareness of the challenges and opportunities of modern biotechnologies at various levels .  
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
The Secretary-General is committed to a collegial , friendly and positive atmosphere in staff / management relations conducive to quality work at a level of productivity in line with staff qualifications and with the Organization 's changing mandates .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
They noted the general satisfaction expressed by the Inspectors with competitive recruitment examinations , but wished to seek clarification from them regarding the apparent contradiction in paragraphs 65 , 67 , 78 and 79 of the report , which stated , on the one hand , that the quality of staff members recruited through examinations had improved and , on the other , that the general level of candidates was rather low .  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in the Professional category , especially in posts at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and sending forward more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , the specialized agencies and the regional commissions ;  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
For example , at an Expert Group Meeting , jointly organized by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development and UNDP in New York , on 14 and 15 December 1994 , it was proposed that a Development Watch should be established to assist decision makers , especially those at the national level , to understand the interaction among physical ( environmental ) , social and economic phenomena and the policy options these interactions suggest .  
Replenishments in 1994 should refurbish multilateral commitment potential if the familiar cyclical pattern holds up , but if adequate funds are not forthcoming from donors , the level of the activities of the multilateral agencies could be impaired in later years .  
The instrument may be designed and established at the national level , specific emission levels set by local authorities , with monitoring and money collecting conducted by regional inspectorates .  
Supports the request made by the Committee at its twelfth session for additional meeting time , with adequate support from the Secretariat , so as to allow the Committee to meet once a year for three weeks for its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions , and recommends that the request made by the Committee at its fourteenth session to hold two sessions in 1996 , each of three weeks ' duration , be considered favourably , within the existing level of budgetary resources ;  
Although some representatives stated that the participation of women in decision-making bodies at the national level had increased , many representatives stressed that women were still far from reaching equal power and that more radical policy interventions and strong political will would be required to bring about immediate changes , including changes in the structure and cultures of institutions .  
The Committee was informed that subsequent to the preparation of the Secretary-General 's report , the Security Council , on 10 February 1995 , approved the deployment of an additional 30 civilian police , increasing the authorized level to 120 ( see S / 1995 / 130 ) .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
The broad mandate outlined in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has sometimes tended to be measured in terms of the number of experts from developing countries working on projects , the frequency of meetings to promote TCDC and the level of procurement from the developing countries , instead of being seen as a rational imperative for ensuring the full integration of TCDC into the wider conception of operational activities in support of the overall development process .  
In the light of current global realities , it is important and timely to reverse this trend and to renew efforts to ensure that the two concepts become more closely linked at an operational level .  
The overexpenditure under this heading was a result of higher requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement ( $ 171,000 ) due to the delayed departure of the Finnish contingent in December 1993 , to additional ration costs ( $ 78,000 ) to replenish UNDOF 's provisions inventory to a level sufficient to sustain operations while newly sought commercial ration contracts were being established , and to slightly higher than anticipated travel costs ( $ 8,000 ) .  
As already discussed , the quality of staff at the higher level is often impressive , but at other levels we are of the belief that quality could be improved through increased training and greater horizontal communication ( including perhaps the publication of an in-house professional periodical ) .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
It will also promote minimization , re-use and environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste and sewage through provision of information strategies , tools and instruments for improved waste management and enhanced capabilities at national and local level for solid and liquid waste management .  
The political and humanitarian problems in Africa that attracted so much public attention were a manifestation of a more deep-rooted and structural crisis that required concerted action by all partners in order to address its causes at the most fundamental level .  
At the national level , United Nations resident coordinators are actively participating in the preparatory activities for the Conference and are assisting in promoting South-South cooperation on urban management at the regional and global levels .  
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
Information services continue to focus on meeting the increasing needs of the media , both at Headquarters and at the local level , for timely , comprehensive , balanced and reliable accounts of the proceedings of meetings of United Nations organs and major important United Nations conferences , as well as of activities of the Organization and the Secretary-General .  
The estimated requirement of $ 393,500 , at maintenance base level , would cover the cost of general temporary assistance for the replacement of staff on maternity leave and sick leave and for additional services during peak workload periods ( $ 373,800 ) ; and overtime and night differential for the retention of clerical and distribution staff and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
A more precise understanding of the desertification issue would involve concerted activities , including consultations with major groups , at the national level in affected countries , and the recognition by Governments of its importance , that is , a cross-sectoral effort involving physical , social , humanitarian and economic factors . 
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .  
The Commission welcomed and encouraged the emerging practice of including representatives of major groups in national delegations to the Commission as an effective way of increasing the participation of such groups at the international level .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
There was great enthusiasm among the countries concerned for this major new initiative for South-South cooperation , which went beyond the objectives of the Caracas Programme of Action inasmuch as it sought , as the Group 's annual meetings progressed , to articulate at the level of heads of Government the economic problems faced by the South and to engage the North in a constructive dialogue .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The denial of drinking water has been particularly devastating , causing an increasing number of Sarajevo 's civilians to fall ill from contaminated water , and the subsequent maladies are approaching epidemic level .  
That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
At its third regular session in 1994 , the Executive Board , inter alia , noted with concern the decreased level of contributions to UNDP and invited Governments to consider increasing their voluntary contributions to UNDP on a more predictable , continuous and assured basis .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .  
Resources from line 1.1.1 would be assigned according to the agreed methodology , and additional resources could be assigned from line 1.1.2 up to an amount roughly comparable to the 1.1.1 level , bearing in mind that , given the availability of good programmes , those resources were intended to provide incentives to improve programme quality in line with decision 94 / 14 .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
UNDP had encouraged resident coordinators to strengthen and establish thematic working groups on HIV and AIDS and to ensure their effective functioning ; invited JCP / UNAIDS and its co-sponsors to attend UNDP training workshops ; participated actively in global - and regional-level activities to develop a strategic plan of action for JCP / UNAIDS ; and was working with staff of JCP / UNAIDS responsible for developing the programme 's approach at country level .  
In developing the standards in appendix II , five principles were followed : ( a ) performance statements were made functional and not equipment-specific ; ( b ) fairness was achieved by establishing a high but equitable level of performance ; ( c ) a firm baseline for a minimum acceptable level of performance was set ; ( d ) the standards must themselves be verifiable in the mission area ; and ( e ) the standards must be at a level and expressed in terms that are acceptable to all Member States .  
As the major equipment rates apply to specifically designed second and third line medical units authorized under the agreement , rates are to be determined based on the development of a standard for the provision of force - level medical support .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .  
It can be easier for the Governments of States that share the same cultural values and are confronted with similar economic and development problems to accept at that level the generalization of a number of fundamental principles regarding public administration and , eventually , judicial review on limited matters or cases by an international court established by a treaty .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
That high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
The authorized staffing level for international and local staff during the period under review reflected a reduction of 28 posts ( 12 international and 16 local staff ) in the number of additional temporary personnel proposed in the cost estimate and amounted to a total of 309 international and 591 local staff .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
The requested reclassifications of three General Service ( Other level ) posts to the Principal level would provide recognition of the additional and difficult functions assigned to very senior staff who have acquired considerable knowledge and experience of a highly complex pension system . 
They concluded that additional staffing was essential to provide the level of management services required for the investment of assets as large as those of UNJSPF , to sustain the global network of direct custodial relationships which have been established , and to enhance the investment decision-making process .  
Review existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
As a result , the Assembly adopted , on 23 December 1993 , resolution 48 / 215 A , in which it : ( a ) approved , on an exceptional basis , the creation of the post of Special Adviser at the Under-Secretary-General level against temporary assistance resources for organizing and coordinating activities related to the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations ; and ( b ) requested the Secretary-General to provide adequate secretariat support for the Preparatory Committee .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .  
In many instances they were headed by or under the patronage of the Head of State or Government , or the first lady of the country ; were established at the senior governmental level ; and often involved several national ministries , with the ministry or authority devoted to family issues , where it existed , usually assuming the lead role .  
A wide array of activities was undertaken at the regional level , including four regional preparatory meetings , with the objective of supporting and supplementing national and local efforts .  
There seems to be a common understanding among the above States that bilateral CSBMs , once agreed , should lead to greater transparency in military activities , thus having a stabilizing effect , especially in border areas , and stimulating contacts between the military of the respective States at the lowest possible level .  
National implementation of international instruments : It was recognized that a gap exists between international instruments and implementation at the national level : the lack of effective implementation of international obligations is due to economic , social and political difficulties inherent in the transition process .  
Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Both the resident coordinator and agency representatives will be held accountable by their respective organizations for the effective and coherent functioning of the system at the country level .  
Paragraph 38 ( b ) of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 specifically stated : " The United Nations system at the country level should be tailored , taking into account the views of the recipient Government , to the specific developmental needs of the country in such a way that they correspond to the ongoing and projected programmes rather than to the institutional structure of the United Nations " .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The activities executed at the regional level by the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific ( PROAP ) at Bangkok serve 40 member States . 4 / The national commissions of UNESCO in the member States themselves form a network of cooperation which is further supported by a number of networks of specialized educational institutions and several thousand key educators in Asia and the Pacific participating in South-South cooperation through a number of mechanisms .  
On a strategic and policy level , the Union 's supreme organ , the Plenipotentiary Conference , meeting at Kyoto in October 1994 , set out its strategic plan for 1995-1999 in resolution 1 of which it considers the subject in the context of the rapidly changing telecommunication environment under three broad headings : restructuring of the telecommunication sector , technological convergence , and globalization .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Based on a strong political commitment , create a national machinery , where it does not exist , and strengthen , as appropriate , existing national machineries , for the advancement of women at the highest possible level of government ; it should have clearly defined mandates and authority ; critical elements would be adequate resources and the ability and competence to influence policy and formulate and review legislation .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , each organization should set out the specific actions they will undertake , including goals and targets to realign priorities and redirect resources to meet the global priorities identified in the Platform for Action .  
Upon entry into force of this Interim Accord , the Party of the First Part recognizes the Party of the Second Part as an independent and sovereign State , under the provisional designation set forth in a letter of the Party of the First Part of the date of this Interim Accord , and the Parties shall at an early date establish diplomatic relations at an agreed level with the ultimate goal of relations at ambassadorial level .  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
Equalizing the risk means raising the quantity , quality and , more importantly , compatibility of preventive and control action at an adequate level on a world-wide scale and putting in place mechanisms designed to maintain and improve that level in a consistent and coordinated fashion .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In view of the replies sent to him by Governments , the Special Rapporteur felt that decisive steps should be taken at the international level to establish effective administrative and legal remedies which victims of intolerance or discrimination based on religion could avail themselves of in cases of violations of the rights set forth in the Declaration .  
A key component of its work is to see to it that national institutions play an effective role in the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level and forge close links with international bodies pursuing the same goal .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Implicit in this approach is that women 's ability to compensate at the household level for the decline in output and for changes in the composition and level of aggregate demand is treated as infinitely elastic , obscuring the impact of macroeconomic policy on the human resource base of economic activity .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
At the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited .

NULLAt the bilateral level , the Algerian Government has made sustained efforts to coordinate policies and strategies to combat terrorism , for example by strengthening judicial cooperation , exchanging information , and circulating details of persons who have committed terrorist acts so that they might be arrested , handed over or extradited . 
The members and alternate members of the Board would receive , for each day they exercise their functions during scheduled sessions at Headquarters and Geneva , one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of the annual compensation equivalent to the base salary and daily subsistence allowance payable to United Nations staff members at the Director ( D-2 ) level , step 1 , serving at Headquarters and Geneva , respectively .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
It was noted that the effect of sound and efficient policies at the micro-economic level as well as the impact on individual and small group initiatives can be blunted by inconsistent or unbalanced macroeconomic policies .  
Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
NULLThe present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 997 ( 1995 ) of 9 June 1995 , by which the Security Council adjusted and extended the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , authorized the gradual reduction of its troop level and requested me to report by 9 August and 9 October 1995 on the discharge of its mandate , the humanitarian situation and the progress made towards the repatriation of refugees .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
In recognition of the vital role of national meteorological services in providing warnings of severe weather events to the community , WMO 's Public Weather Services Programme includes specific projects directed at strengthening the capacities of national meteorological services and in raising the awareness and level of public understanding about the services provided .  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
NULLReview existing periodic assessment of forests , including relevant socio-economic and environmental factors , at the global level ; identify shortfalls in present assessments relative to policy considerations ; and recommend practical ways of improving such assessments .  
Its objectives are : training of the key stakeholders in understanding the requirements and setting up the processes for the implementation of the Convention at the national level , and provision of substantive training material covering the Convention and providing the framework for wide-reaching in-country training by a country team set up and trained through the programme .  
In the space of only three years , the Convention went from a conceptual to a concrete reality , establishing mechanisms and procedures to carry forward cooperation among States in stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at a safe level .  
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
In practical terms , this means raising the level of consciousness about the problem at both the global and the national levels , stimulating dialogue among all concerned and facilitating cooperation between national and international actors .  
Both objectives fulfil a catalytic role by raising the level of consciousness among the pertinent actors , generating functional dialogue with all concerned and fostering a collaborative process involving the primary responsibility of the Government and the complementary or supplementary role of the international community .  
At the field level , a letter dated 31 July 1995 from the Emergency Relief Coordinator assigned responsibility for in-country coordination to the Disaster Management Team headed by the resident representative / coordinator , or any other mechanism established to deal with a specific humanitarian crisis .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
Programmes and projects submitted in accordance with the provisions of article 8 , provided with adequate funding and approved in accordance with established procedures shall be formalized through specific agreements establishing the objectives , degrees of participation and forms of contribution of each participating country , based on its relative level of development .  
It is , however , in relation to national action at the country level - in assisting individual countries to translate the outcomes of the conferences into concrete national policies and programmes , and in providing resident coordinators and country-level teams with coherent system-wide support - that existing inter-agency efforts need to be especially reinforced .  
At a recent meeting at the ministerial level held in London on 20 December 1994 , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom had confirmed their support for the process begun in Brussels , recognized the importance for Gibraltar of the establishment of a sustainable economy , and agreed to cooperate in combating the growing illicit trafficking in the Gibraltar area .  
If the level of women 's representation of between 30 and 35 per cent and above is considered to form a critical mass , the Secretariat can be considered to have achieved that status in such occupational groups as political affairs , legal affairs , public information , administration , social affairs , economic affairs , human resources and human rights .  
In his report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , the Secretary-General noted that representation of ACC members was at the senior official level , that this arrangement had led to a substantive dialogue on coordination issues of mutual interest and that he considered that , should the institution of joint meetings continue to be maintained , they should be organized in the future along similar lines ( A / 48 / 639 , para .  NULL  
The Government also described the general legislative measures taken to eliminate racial discrimination in education , the special measures taken to ensure equality and to help the economically disadvantaged , and pointed out its commitment to the goal of providing access to general education for all children , funded by the State at an acceptable level of quality . 
For the period starting on 1 May 1995 up to 31 October 1995 , the MINUSAL team was composed of 11 Professionals , headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the assistant secretary-general level , supported by 8 civilian police , 1 internationally recruited General Service staff and 15 local level staff .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
IMO and UNCTAD have joined in a search for solutions , and now consider that the most feasible approach would be to focus on individual ports , with some aspects handled at the national , regional or even global level . 
We continue to support the multifaceted activity of the Agency in such areas as halting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials , enhancing the level of their physical protection , and preparing an international convention to deal with radioactive wastes .  
From the point of view of international law , the State was an abstract legal entity consisting of a territory , a population and a set of institutions and , although it existed in the legal and political sense at the international level , in essence it was legally neither good nor bad , neither innocent nor guilty .  
In parallel , UNIDO is preparing a manual for self-diagnosis of critical technological needs for sustained competitiveness at the plant level , the core of which could be applied to all developing countries .  
At the level of the United Nations and its agencies , the strengthening of the capacity of the system to support an integrated , effective follow-up to the Fourth World Conference as part of the overall effort to ensure the coordinated implementation of the results of the series of recent global conferences should be a key objective in pursuing further the ongoing reform process .  
The Committee also decided to strengthen coordinated support for follow-up action at the country level , through inter-agency task forces organized around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods ; and ( c ) basic social services for all .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
From that standpoint , high priority should be given to implementation of actions such as explicit incorporation of the aid targets and commitments of the Programme of Action in the donors ' aid budgets , increase in the level of concessional multilateral assistance , operationalization of additional flows to social sector , environmental conservation and eradication of poverty and enhancement of the value of aid through improving aid quality .  
Regional meetings to prepare for the mid-term global review were organized by the relevant United Nations regional commissions in accordance with paragraph 4 ( c ) of General Assembly resolution 49 / 98 , and the substantive inputs provided through the preparatory process at this level were transmitted to the Donor-Recipient Meeting in May-June 1995 and to the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting itself . 
Subject to the approval of that post by the General Assembly , the Secretary-General intends to appoint a Director with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
She requested clarification of the proposed conversion of a temporary D-2 post to established status , and asked why the post of Secretary-General of UNCTAD had been vacant for so long , on what terms the officer-in-charge had been employed , and why some posts had been filled by staff at a lower level receiving special post allowances .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
Regarding preparations at the national level , the Committee took note of the substantial progress achieved since the first substantive session , and further strengthened the best practices initiative on improving the living environment by further refining the criteria for nomination and the format for reporting on best practices .

In the interests of increased savings and the successful implementation of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and given the fact that the outcome thus far had fallen short of expectations , his delegation attached great importance to the ongoing efforts of resident coordinators to ensure closer involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions in operational activities , in particular at the field level . 
To achieve precisely that objective , Botswana had committed itself to promoting universal access to education up to junior secondary level and had adopted in 1994 new policies on education aimed at increasing access to both the secondary and tertiary levels of education .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society , E . 75 .

The members and alternate members of the Arbitration Board would receive for each day they exercise their functions during scheduled sessions at Headquarters and at Geneva , one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of the annual compensation equivalent to the base salary and daily subsistence allowance payable to United Nations staff members at the Director ( D-2 ) level , step 1 , serving at Headquarters and Geneva respectively .  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights . 
Provision for two military observers and 14 temporary posts authorized for OSGA in 1995 ( one-D-2 , one P-5 , two Field Service , one General Service and nine local-level posts ) and an additional three posts : one at the Field Service level for a Communications Officer and two local-level posts , one for a vehicle and generator mechanic and one for an administrative assistant ;

delegation considered that decision unjustified , since it linked the basic level of remuneration in the common system to non-representative remuneration levels in selected subsectors of the United States federal civil service .  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular , the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes with a time-frame for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
The work of public administration should be guided by the principle that correct decisions should be taken , without unnecessary delay , and at the lowest possible administrative level as close as possible to the people whom the decisions will affect and that powers and accountability should go hand in hand .  
The renewed decentralization at the level of urban and rural communes a total of 208 in the entire national territory formed the framework for basic development .  
The region is the ideal framework for an administration characterized by an economic and social dynamic , frank and constructive dialogue between elected representatives and citizens , and coordination and a willingness to act at the operational level of local communities .  
With respect to this and to the general follow-up of the subject , we believe that the United Nations Development Programme , which has been doing work of this kind , must continue to play a primary role in this field , helping to coordinate activities in the field at the inter-agency level and promoting complementary activities at the bilateral level , particularly in State reform in the economic and social fields and in the justice sector .  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
The report pointed out that obvious indicators such as staff size larger than the approved level ( 300 instead of 71 ) , excessive overhead , large suspense account balances , a large number of unpaid bills and excess expenditure were ignored or not effectively followed up for redress .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
There is an urgent need to draw up and put into effect measures and strategies which , on the basis of international cooperation and shared responsibility , will make it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on this phenomenon and to do away with partial and subjective evaluations in rating the level of compliance of each Government in combating drug trafficking , or , still worse , in making use of this rating as a political weapon and pressure tactic .  
With the aim of laying the groundwork for a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development , several international meetings , starting with the Summit held in Miami in 1994 , have expressed support for the decision to hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
We support the efforts of the Angolan Government and the international community to undertake all tasks aimed at bringing about a lasting peace , social stability and the normal functioning of institutions at the national level , without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy the tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they could and should benefit from , given the huge potential of their country .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
For in fact the resources allocated to cooperation for development have fallen , on the pretext that up to now this has achieved nothing for the beneficiary countries , including our countries in Africa , whose priorities , at both national and continental level , have been to relieve absolute , endemic poverty , to eradicate hunger and malnutrition , to overcome disease and illiteracy , and to meet the needs for housing and sanitation .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
If we think only of these two items , 194 trade union organizations asked by their central organ to promote the objectives of employment at the national level and more than 100 parliaments also resolved to take initiatives on the Summit , we realize how this process has been gaining ground in the political and main social sectors in our countries .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In the year and a half since the World Summit for Social Development , many countries have made great efforts in implementing the outcome of the Summit at the national level by designating national focal points , formulating short - , medium - and long-term strategies and plans for social development and starting to take appropriate and concrete measures to implement them .  
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
At the domestic level , the national Government , owing to radical economic reforms , has made progress in the far-reaching process of bilateral cooperation with countries committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
Until these two challenges in particular are addressed , Africa 's capacity to mobilize resources at the domestic level will continue to be stunted , and its reliance on fickle and declining official development assistance and inflows of external resources will be unavoidable .  
On another level , this blockade , which has continued for more than 35 years , constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law , because it has led to unimaginable human suffering among the Cuban civilian population by imposing restrictions on the sovereign right of Cuba to develop economic relations with other countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
A low level of development , poverty , unemployment , the external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations of the world market are some of the major ones .  
Beyond these diplomatic efforts at the international level , however , the most critical requirement is for the parties directly concerned to bridge the political chasm by engaging in candid and open-minded dialogue .  
In our view , the preliminary estimate of resources now approved has provided the Secretary-General with the potential to absorb costs , up to the level of $ 70-million , relating to new and unforeseen mandates in the area of international peace and security , which , it was intended , should be covered by the proposed contingency provision .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
" Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
Several aspects can be determined which identify or refer to people living in poverty : although much attention is given to the problems of the urban poor , in many countries the poor most often live in rural or isolated areas ; they often have large families and low life expectancy ; they survive without benefit of many basic services ; they evidence a low level of participation in economic and political life ; they often lack the basic means for productive employment ; and they generally lack a sense of security in their lives .  
Organizations of civil society have been praised for being flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at the grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Her delegation was convinced that , in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Platform for Action , specific and positive policies must be formulated and applied at the national level .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
A strengthened Centre could not only mobilize public awareness but also provide vital assistance to Governments and non-governmental organizations in the field of advisory services and training with a view to facilitating implementation and understanding of human rights instruments at the national level .  
Such progress reports should avoid the need for additional reporting at the national level ; the Commission may wish to urge close cooperation , coordinated by the United Nations Secretariat , among a wide range of organizations currently engaged in relevant information-gathering and analysis exercises .  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
9 One respondent concurred with the proposal for annual instead of quarterly statistical reporting on international trade in narcotic drugs but added that quarterly reconciliation at the domestic level would have to be maintained .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 . 
On the social level , survivors required immediate assistance in meeting the basic necessities of life , such as food and clothing ; preferential access to social services , such as housing and medical care ; and strengthened psychological rehabilitation services .  
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
A vital element in the development and improvement of the Division is the appointment of a Director at the D-2 level with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
Convinced of the urgent need , at the highest political level , to marshal the global consensus and commitment required for the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all , through the adoption of concerted policies and a plan of action for implementation by Governments , international institutions and all sectors of civil society ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
Although the structural causes of the problems have often to be dealt with at the national and sometimes the international level , progress will depend to a large degree on local authorities , civic engagement and the forging of partnerships at all levels of government with the private sector , the cooperative sector , non-governmental and community-based organizations , workers and employers and civil society at large . 
In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
Working under the guidance of INCB , UNDCP and governments will ensure that narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors needed for medical , scientific and other licit purposes will continue to be available ; diversion of narcotic drugs from international trade into the illicit traffic will continue to be minimal ; and the level of diversion of psychotropic substances from international trade will decrease .  
In that connection his delegation had reluctantly accepted the failure to establish any of the 27 posts requested by the Secretary-General under the regular budget on the understanding that the number of posts and the level of appropriations under those sections were provisional and would be reviewed during the examination of the support account and that any posts that might be established would be the subject of revised estimates in the context of the first performance report .  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to an integrated and coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system should identify the specific actions they will undertake to meet the priorities identified in the Global Plan of Action .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
Reaffirms the importance of the development of effective , independent and pluralistic national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and , inter alia , the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48 / 134 , and recognizes that it is the right of each State to choose the framework that is best suited to its particular needs at the national level ;  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
It is apparent from the comparative data provided that over time , changes in the number , scope , scale and complexity of peace-keeping operations , as well as the considerations outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 above , have affected and rendered less meaningful the pragmatic validity of the current methodology and funding formula for the support account and its ability to generate a sufficient , assured and stable level of resources , which is necessary to support essential backstopping functions at Headquarters .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
However , in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future , we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200 , as provided for in the draft resolution .  
The United States has set itself up as an international judge , invoking its own fanciful interpretation of the relevant provisions of those international treaties , the articles of which possess , all in equal measure , the same importance and legally binding force for those States which , in the first place , through the act of constitutional ratification , transformed those treaties into sources of their domestic legislation and into international obligations , apart from the ethical aspect of their application at the international level . 
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 7 ] / including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
Recalling also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets , and the relationship of national manufacturers to their government , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) played a relatively effective role in regulating the use of frequencies and orbits at the international level , adopting a balanced and comprehensive approach to the task that had , on the whole , proved successful in guaranteeing access to the orbit and the spectrum .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
In addition , at the local community level around mine-sites , companies are providing enhancement to existing schooling programmes , health-care programmes - both medical and dental , including preventative care programmes and support through provision of social workers and also providing physical infrastructure such as water-wells , schools , health clinics and recreational facilities .  
It is understandable that the restoration of such confidence may be impeded by the deep wounds and distrust left by the conflict at the individual human level as well as by current political calculations .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets and the relationship of national manufacturers to their Governments , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
Some States have established central bodies at the national level to develop a comprehensive approach and coordinate the activities of an increased number of associations involved in action to support victims .  
Such reasons include differences in public policy priorities and objectives , which may be based , inter alia , on a country 's view that scientific evidence is not persuasive , is controversial or is lacking ; and the belief that joining or adhering to the required level of environmental standards of the MEA may be expensive ( and a view that there are more pressing problems , environmental or otherwise , that deserve higher priority ) . 
Action at the national level has been coupled by international efforts to promote a culture of good governance and strengthened institutions and to systematize legislative measures to prevent and control the spread of corrupt practices .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
The Office will include four other international Professional staff : a political adviser / special assistant at P-5 level , a legal affairs officer at P-5 / P-4 level , a military advisor at P-4 level and an administrative officer at P-3 level .  Its support staff will consist of 10 international and locally recruited General Service staff and 2 security officers .  
Global statistical surveys and methodologies for data collection and the development of indicators , especially for use at the national level , are crucial for comprehensive and uniform data collection from which global trends can be identified , which are in turn the basis for intergovernmental policy recommendations .  
Prepare a comprehensive report on existing international and regional norms and standards and on ongoing normative and policy efforts at the international level regarding trafficking in women and violence resulting therefrom , and develop options for comprehensive international responses to the issue , including strengthened preventive action against trafficking in women and girls and child prostitution ( DAW / DPCSD , UNESCO , CPCJD , Centre for Human Rights ) .  
It is also expected that regional follow-up will be discussed during the consultative meetings of the regional representatives of ACC members , following the initiative of the Secretary-General , who has requested the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to convene such meetings in order to facilitate a dialogue on the requirements and conditions for improved coordination at the regional level .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
To promote the fundamental principles of maintenance of the rule of law and good governance and to increase the capacity of States to devise and implement effective , integrated and consolidated strategies and measures at the national level , and to put into effect bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels .  
This will result in an increase in bilateral and multilateral arrangements at the regional and international levels , together with the promulgation of more effective strategies and measures at the national level to deal with sophisticated forms of crime ;  
The space research activities in Morocco , related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring , were characterized by an active , realistic and long-term policy at both the national level ( coordination , information , training and project formulation ) and the international level ( participation in forums , international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects ) .  
Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national Governments , it is of primary importance to continue to enhance international collaborative efforts to promote a high level of nuclear safety world wide .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
The Secretary-General trusts that the additional information provided herein will allow the General Assembly to establish the minimum predictable annual level of support account resources needed to meet the backstopping requirements at Headquarters by endorsing , at its second resumed session , his proposals , 1 / which were based on the outcome of the comprehensive review .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
The statements made by the Secretary-General to date that no additional mandates can be absorbed have been based upon an assumption that budgeted cost levels and exchange rates will be fulfilled and that the level of real resources ( number of posts , vacancy rates , etc . ) assumed under the $ 2.6-billion appropriation will also evolve as anticipated and that efficiency gains now identified would be applied to achieving the mandated budget reduction of $ 154-million .  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
The political and professional debate has in recent years focused , and is likely to continue to focus , on a number of major questions : the relationship between a high level of social provision and individual incentives to work and national competitiveness ; the extent to which individual and family responsibility might be undermined by social provision ; the relative efficiency of public and private provision and of various mixes of the two ; how to divide responsibility among different levels of government ; and how to keep costs in check .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
The United Nations also has to promote procedural safeguards , institutions of accountability and representation , and a culture of democracy , without which rapid political and social change may undermine traditional mediating practices , open avenues to crime and disruption and have seriously destabilizing effects on society and the future of democratization .  NULLAt the international level , the universality of the United Nations is a key asset .  
As a comprehensive decision , the legal status must include the regulation of questions of navigation , the use of biological and mineral resources , and ecology , including the rise in the sea level and the definition of the jurisdictional limits of the littoral States .  
In view of the low level of contributions registered during the past biennium , the Board emphasized the Institute 's urgent need to make an active and strong fund-raising effort , to ensure an adequate flow of contributions to its Trust Fund .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
The preconditions included an existing level of experience and education in order to quickly absorb new knowledge ; the organization of existing groups and institutions in a way that enabled the smooth flow of relevant information ; close collaboration between research groups in order to produce the best results ; international cooperation ; and , in particular , cooperation with more experienced partners in order to successfully transfer technology and subsidies from government or other sources .  
The subprogramme , which is implemented by the Division for Environment Management and Social Development , provides assistance in conceptualizing , formulating and implementing action-oriented , people-centred programmes at the national level emphasizing the interface between natural resources , environmental management and social development through operational projects and substantive contributions to relevant global conferences and intergovernmental bodies .  
Recalling that ( , while ) the main responsibility for the formulation and implementation of the strategies , policies , programmes and actions required to ( combat / eradicate ) poverty rests primarily at the national level ( , there is also an urgent need for stronger international cooperation and the support of international institutions to assist countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide basic social protection and services ) ( , they can not be successfully achieved without the collective commitment and efforts of the international community ) ,  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
A significant enhancement and strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights leading to increased effectiveness of international machinery , improved respect of human rights at the national level , through , inter alia , universal ratification of basic international human rights treaties and the incorporation of those standards into the domestic legislation of States ;  
The prime objective of the task forces is to assure that adequate support from the headquarters level is provided to the resident coordinators and the United Nations country teams in each country so that they may , in full consultation with national Governments , facilitate a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences ( para . 39 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 ) .  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
The executive secretaries of the regional economic commissions will be asked to produce a product analogous to that requested of the resident coordinator , focusing on regional aspects of the major thrusts of United Nations system activities in the regional level .  
In order to strengthen cooperation at the inter-agency level , ACC established in 1995-three ad hoc inter-agency task forces to provide integrated support for country-level action around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development , with the World Bank serving as lead agency ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods , with the ILO as lead agency ; and ( c ) basic social services for all , with UNFPA as lead agency .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
This high level of attrition at a stage when continuing learning is both optimal and desirable represents , from an educational and manpower planning perspective , a wasted national opportunity to expand and strengthen the human resource pool for the enhancement of national productivity .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Maintenance of " old habits " is reinforced , in addition to spiritual and cultural traditions , through a low level of social and geographical mobility , strong social control exerted by communities and - paradoxically - the socialist system enforcing uniformity in society .  
Considering the Security Council sanctions an inalienable and integral part of the international efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia , Ukraine has complied with all United Nations resolutions concerning the obligatory trade and economic embargo against the FRY and has taken appropriate measures on a national level to ensure their observance .  
Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Through the application of a relational and multidisciplinary database , a selection of economic , cultural and social variables is linked to the biophysical condition of forest resources in selected sites at the local level where periodic assessments are conducted to also observe the dynamics of change .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
At the international level , at least three activities are needed to improve coordination : ( a ) harmonization of coordination and cooperation between policy and planning frameworks at the country level to avoid confusion and overlap , ( b ) critical evaluation of emerging approaches to facilitate speedy adoption of feasible solutions and ( c ) easy access to information at international , regional , country and project levels .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
He reported that minimum requirements for ECOMOG to carry out its responsibilities included an acceptable level of communication between units and bases ; availability of power generation facilities , especially in remote areas ; and additional trucks and air support to ensure adequate mobility of troops .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
It was also suggested to include in the statute such specific grounds for the excusing and disqualification of judges as : that the judge is the injured party or a relative of the accused or of the injured party , or a national of a complainant State or of a State of which the accused is a national , or that the judge has acted as a witness , representative , counsel , public prosecutor or judge at the national level in the case involving the accused .  
It is anticipated that the revised programme of work as decided by the ninth session of the Conference can be implemented within the reduced level of resources , utilizing , inter alia , the gains from the efficiency review , which is currently ongoing .  
Regarding the proposed United Nations humanitarian programme for Somalia , the United Nations agencies at the country level have embarked on an inter-agency analytical and consultative process with a view to defining and reaching consensus on the role of the United Nations in the country over the medium-term , reflecting a common system-wide vision and outlining a set of broad objectives and strategies .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
While the United Nations system has an essential and complementary role to play in supporting Governments in their efforts to eradicate poverty , the primary responsibility for the assessment of poverty situations and for the formulation , strengthening and implementation of national poverty eradication plans and programmes lies with Governments and requires a strong political commitment at the national level .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
The majority of the replies stressed that to maintain the momentum for the implementation of the commitments adopted at Copenhagen , concrete initiatives at the national level were required with strong and visible support from the United Nations and the United Nations system and other multilateral institutions .  
Some Governments have launched initiatives to eradicate poverty , such as stimulating job creation and growth , maintaining an effective safety net consisting of a comprehensive social security system , universal health care and community and education services , and providing adequate housing ; others have adopted national targets to reduce the level of poverty by a certain year .  
Pledging to carry out practical reforms , consistent with the specific situation in each country , they aimed to achieve a high level of employment and widely shared prosperity , and reforms of the tax and social system to ensure that " work pays " , particularly for the least well-off ; lowering social security charges , which place a burden on low-skilled jobs , in countries with high indirect labour costs ; and improving public employment agencies ;  
The Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its October 1995 session , in order to ensure that the United Nations system effectively provides support for the integrated implementation at the country level of the action programmes that emerged from the World Summit for Social Development and other recent United Nations conferences , established inter-agency task forces , respectively , on basic social services for all , chaired by UNFPA ; employment and sustainable livelihoods , chaired by ILO ; and the enabling environment for economic and social development , chaired by the World Bank .  
In its resolution 50 / 161 , the General Assembly reaffirmed the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level .  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to ensure effective coordination of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and adequate consideration of human settlements needs in all activities of the United Nations system , and to include the implementation of the Habitat Agenda in the agenda of the ACC machinery , and in the mandates of the thematic task forces that are promoting an integrated and coordinated follow-up , at the inter-agency level , of the outcomes of recent global conferences .  I , resolution 1 , annex II .  
This unique and unprecedented formula of coordinated inter-institutional , international cooperation at the regional level in support of national Governments in their endeavour to observe the mandatory measures taken by the Security Council was identified as the main reason for the effectiveness of sanctions in the case of the former Yugoslavia .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
In many countries , although scarcity is less of a problem at the national level , overuse of groundwater , contributing to waterlogging and salinity , has become a major problem in specific regions , such as northern China , western and southern India and parts of Mexico . 
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The political leadership now has the opportunity to ensure that , in particular through the functioning of common institutions at the national level , all three communities can work towards the consolidation of a sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law , respect for the human rights of all peoples and the development of a representative democracy .  
The problems associated with formidable structural adjustment difficulties and economic reforms , declining flow of already low level of development resources , extremely low export capacity , compounded by limited market access , crushing debt burden , low level of human development , environmental degradation etc . , continue to impede seriously the development efforts of the least developed countries .

A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
Calls upon all the parties to cooperate fully , and in good faith , in the prompt formation and functioning of all of the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair local elections at the municipal level in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ,  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
" The actuarial equivalent of one third of the maximum benefit that would be payable to a participant retiring at the normal retirement age , on the same date as the participant , with a final average remuneration equal to the pensionable remuneration on that date for the top step of level P-5 on the scale of pensionable remuneration appended to article 54 . "  
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
The pivotal role of regional organizations in democratizing development should be enhanced by opening channels to the regional level for the views of those at the local level , and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles to the flow or volume of assistance ; the United Nations regional economic and social commissions are well placed to contribute to such an effort .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
I see the Assembly performing on a continuing basis the role that the special international conferences have been playing in recent years , addressing comprehensively , and at the highest political level , the major global issues facing the international community , and fostering national and international commitments .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had the Czech Republic been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
Member States included in the groups set out in paragraphs 3 ( c ) and ( d ) of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions , shall be credited with the full amount by which their aggregate contributions for the financing of peacekeeping operations during the period in question exceeded the aggregate level that would have applied had Slovakia been included in one of the groups of Member States set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 43 / 232 , as adjusted by subsequent resolutions ;  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
The members and alternate members of the Arbitration Board would receive for each day they exercise their functions during scheduled sessions at Headquarters and at Geneva , one three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth of the annual compensation equivalent to the base salary and daily subsistence allowance payable to United Nations staff members at the Director ( D-2 ) level , step I , serving at Headquarters and Geneva respectively .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The privatization of the economy is being completed , the level of inflation has been steadily low , the national currency is stable and liquid , and for the first time in a little more than five years of independence we have registered economic growth . 
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
I am among those who believe that democracy and the establishment of a human rights regime at the planetary level are both irresistible and irrepressible , and that the limits are constituted only by the limits of personal liberty itself that is , when our liberty infringes upon the liberty of our fellow human beings for , after all , we are all social beings .  
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
In another context , and at the level of the private sector , Egyptian businessmen have not held back initiating a number of economic projects with their Palestinian counterparts designed to enhance the efficiency of the Palestinian economy and save it from the consequences of the destructive closures imposed on it at random by Israel .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
While my delegation is deeply concerned about the problem of nuclear disarmament , at a practical level it is also convinced of the need for urgent and decisive action to curtail the illicit trafficking in small arms .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
At the present session of the Commission , the discussion focused on lessons learnt in the course of the ongoing exercise and on the substantive conclusions emerging from it that could guide practical follow-up activities , particularly at the country or field level , involving the United Nations system in a coherent manner in support of national plans and programmes .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
Consequently , if the proposals are to apply both at the international level and at the national level , they must be articulated in such a way that those to be implemented at the international level have a counterpart in the standards and mechanisms designed to be applied in the internal system of States .  
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
In some cities in Europe , campaigns to encourage communities to separate waste at the household level have been so successful that there is insufficient capacity to recycle all the waste collected by municipal authorities and , because of increased supply , the market price for recycled materials has dropped drastically .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Violence against women , especially domestic violence , appears to be pervasive , and systematic and serious efforts are required to address this problem , at the legislative level and through practical measures such as a comprehensive awareness-raising and education campaign for the public in general , and in particular for law enforcement agencies such as the police , lawyers and judges .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
As regards confidential data on Sammarinese individuals being transferred outside the borders of the Republic , the release of information is conditioned on the prior and motivated authorization of the Guarantor , who will have to verify whether the country to which confidential information is being transmitted ensures the same level of protection of personal data as that established in Sammarinese legislation . 
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
The Plan includes clear objectives , target audience ( organized and unorganized elements of society ) , strategies ( trainers training , organization of networks , integration of human rights in all educational curricula , utilization of village-level officials to reach out to the community level , promotional campaigns including artistic and cultural activities , development of monitoring and evaluation systems , etc . ) and programmes , including the creation of a human rights training , documentation and research centre ( the Human Rights Academy ) .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
On the political level , active public life was generally closed to them , apart from a few isolated cases of women rulers5 and others who played a part in " town hall " discussions of social issues .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
Although the number of boys enrolled in primary school is roughly equal to that of girls , the drop-out rate among girls is so much higher that the initial benefit is lost .  Teenage pregnancies and marriages , the inadequacy of recovery structures , impoverished parents , the girls ' lack of a sense of reality , and backward prejudices towards them are among the main causes of girls ' low level of education , which is reflected in a very high illiteracy rate .  
The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Centre for Human Rights should provide advisory services on the organization at the federal and State level of training courses for teachers in preschool , primary or basic and secondary educational establishments to make them aware of the importance of teaching the principles of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion and belief .  
Educated women in the urban areas of northern Afghanistan expressed grave concern over the restrictive measures imposed on women by the Taliban movement , especially in large urban centres which had achieved a certain level of sophistication such as Kabul and Herat , where women have played a prominent role in the culture for centuries .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
When the applicable portable tank instruction identified in Column 10 of the Dangerous Goods List and described in 4.2.4.2.6 indicates that bottom openings are prohibited there shall be no openings below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit . 
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
While welcoming the existence of government bodies competent to deal with the welfare of children at the national level , the Committee expresses its concern at the insufficient coordination between these bodies as well as between national and local bodies in developing a comprehensive approach to the implementation of the Convention .  
While viewing with interest the extensive delegation to non-governmental organizations of delivery of certain support services to children and their families , the Committee considers that the ultimate responsibility for the quality of such Government _ supported services rests with the State party - be it at the central or local level - and that delegated programmes need careful monitoring and evaluation .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
For purposes of building mutual trust during the first , second and third stages of reintegration , constant contacts shall be established and maintained at the level of unit commanders , contacts among personnel shall be organized and special measures for joint training shall be conducted .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
Given the high level of technical sophistication that might be expected from certification authorities and the high level of trust they were intended to generate , certification authorities should , in normal circumstances , be held liable whenever the issuance of faulty certificates resulted in damages .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
It was generally felt that it would be of little avail for the purpose of protecting the end-users to require the certification authority to follow adequate procedures for establishing the accuracy of the information , or properly identifying the holders of private keys , and at the same time to allow the certification authority to avoid liability by issuing certificates that fell below the minimum level of information required to be contained in a certificate .  
The work of UNIFEM consists of bringing the reality of women 's lives at the local level " upstream " , so that they become a factor in policy-making and economic decisions at the governmental level , in corporate decision-making and within the global consensus forged through United Nations mechanisms .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
At the national level , frameworks need to be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of trade liberalization so as to be able to design and implement effective policies to address any unintended negative consequences .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
In preparation for its special session to review and appraise the implementation of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly , in paragraph 13 ( b ) of its resolution 50 / 113 of 20 December 1995 , requested the Secretary-General to prepare country profiles providing a concise presentation of progress made and constraints encountered in implementing Agenda 21 at the national level , compiled on the basis of national information received and in close cooperation with the Governments concerned . 
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
Its development , however , should not delay action , and it may not be needed in countries where major direct or indirect causes have been identified , well understood and documented , or where deforestation is not viewed as a problem at the national level .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel also emphasized the need for efforts to enhance comparability and compatibility between various international and regional processes on the development and implementation of criteria and indicators , and stressed the importance of mutual recognition among sets of criteria and indicators as tools for assessing trends in forest management and conditions at the national level ; and on transparent methods for the measurement of indicators and for the collection , assembly , storage and dissemination of data .  
The resettlement and integration verification area would consist of the Chief ( P-5 ) , one-P-4 to liaise with the international and national institutions responsible for the resettlement of displaced persons , one P-3 ( local ) to deal with the legal aspects of repatriation and documentation of ex-combatants , one military liaison officer , and one civilian police observer , supported by three Local level staff .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
The representative explained that the definition of child sex tourism as presently worded was too broad and too vague and thus presented difficulties as regards its application at the national legislative level , particularly in her country which provided for the direct application of international standards .  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments and , at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;

While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .

Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;

An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .

Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
At the internal level , the relation between the Government and its citizens is based , as I said before , on constitutional legitimacy ; on equality among all citizens , whether male or female ; on equality in rights and obligations of men and women alike ; on the freedom of individuals and groups ; on the freedom of association to parties , trade unions and civilian community organizations ; on freedom of the press ; and on the protection of human rights .  
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider fully the Alliance of Small Island States ( AOSIS ) draft protocol during the ongoing negotiations , especially at the forthcoming Kyoto conference , in order to pursue the greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or other legal instrument .  
In this respect the 1996 report of the World Bank notes that the burden of debt in many of the least developed countries has reached such a level that it is virtually impossible for them to continue with their economic reforms , which are of crucial importance ; and that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that in 1996 official development assistance , which can reduce the effect of indebtedness , fell to its lowest level in real terms in 23 years .  
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
The issues he articulated the imperative of development cooperation based on common concerns ; shared values ; solidarity and responsibility to each other ; the need for more resolute action at the international level to address the problem of widening global inequalities and marginalization are issues that require broad debate . 
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
We share the views of the representative of the Getty Information Institute on the need to rely on some standardized , basic method of exchanging information on stolen cultural property and on the importance of having precise information about such property , as well as the conclusion that only through closer cooperation between private organizations and the public sector , at both the national and the international level , will we be able to curb this illicit traffic . 
Sound political logic and balanced reasoning are required from all of us , primarily with regard to the pivotal equation , that is , finding the golden mean between the level of representation on the reformed Security Council and the imperative need to ensure its effectiveness .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
At the close of the Review Conference , the European Union pledged to continue to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel landmines and to strive towards the goal of their eventual elimination as stated in resolution 50 / 70 O . The Union firmly believes that the international community at every level must intensify its efforts towards eliminating the causes of this international humanitarian disaster as well as getting to grips with its horrific effects . 
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission adopted resolution 1994 / 45 , entitled The question of integrating the rights of women into the human rights mechanism of the United Nations and the elimination of violence against women , in which inter alia , it called for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status of women and the human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms .  
UNDCP is assisting the Government in establishing a permanent institution at the national level responsible for raising funds and planning , coordinating , implementing and monitoring technical cooperation in alternative development projects in the country .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
At the international level , priority should be given to the successful completion of the ongoing inter-governmental negotiations for a global framework convention which would seek to establish an agreed set of general principles and rules governing all international watercourses and to apply and adjust those principles and rules to the unique conditions of each international watercourse and the needs of the States concerned .  
That global programme set up through United Nations inter-agency cooperation and underpinned by strong support at the national level in many countries , facilitated the establishment of a network of representative basins , improving understanding of hydrology and water resource management .  
There is a need for better designed projects at the national level , with particular attention being paid to environmental impact and economic performance , together with policies aimed at creating an environment that encourages private-sector investment ( internal and external ) and donor support .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
At the very minimum , the mandate requires the services of two regular human rights officers , adequate administrative support , and a commensurate level of secretarial expertise .  
Even in some low-income countries that are pursuing sound policies , their low level of development - characterized by structural rigidities , weak institutions and administration , poorly functioning markets and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure - have prevented a rapid and strong response to reform efforts , which may delay the provision of relief under the initiative . 
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
The Council also expressed grave concern about the excessive level of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including the introduction of sophisticated weaponry .  
Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120 , with a desirable mid-point of 115 , for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply , on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time ;  
The risk to an individual or to a coherent group of individuals should be limited to a maximum tolerable level above which risks are considered unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances such as saving life .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
Israel reported that at the criminal supervisory level , a well-equipped and highly mobile " environmental patrol " , staffed by trained personnel authorized with police officers ' powers , operated within the Ministry of the Environment .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
IMO forwarded a document entitled " Status of international conventions relating to marine pollution of which IMO is depositary or responsible for secretariat duties " , which provided information of relevance to the issues of concluded bilateral and multilateral treaties , including legislation to ensure their implementation , and information on the status of implementation of international conventions at the national level .  
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
The effort has attracted strong and high _ level political support from a large number of countries ; it is overwhelmingly supported by the public , leading NGOs and a growing band of senior military figures .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
The intense work undertaken during the interim period has laid some of the needed foundations for the necessary convergency between the efforts of affected country Parties and developed country Parties , thus paving the way for gradual progress at the field level of the arid lands marginalized by ecological degradation and poverty .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
With regard to project activities , the Committee was informed that a reserve is maintained for each project in accordance with United Nations administrative instructions ( ST / AI / 285 ) for technical cooperation trust funds , which stipulates in Part IV , B , that " a cash reserve at the level of 15 per cent of the annual estimated expenditures " is to be maintained during the implementation of the trust fund activities to cover eventual shortfalls and will be utilized to meet the final expenditure of the trust fund , including liquidating liabilities .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Further action at the international level includes recent decisions of the UNEP Governing Council and of IFCS at its second session to prepare for the expeditious conclusion of conventions on prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , bearing in mind the need for a comprehensive approach to the control of such pollutants , including necessary international mechanisms to assist developing countries and economies in transition in implementing such conventions .  
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
While it was recognized that an enabling environment for women 's participation in the economy was required at the national level , it was also noted that the international level should not be overlooked because of its impact on women and the national economic situation .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments , and at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;

While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
Successful efforts at the regional level demonstrate the feasibility of this undertaking and constitute proof of the ability of the international community to arrive at common concepts and to devise generally acceptable methods and strategies that would form the basis of improved and effective international cooperation .  
A technical seminar will be organized in October l997 , supported by the Government of the Netherlands and the European Union , on the theme of " Preventing and combating the illegal employment of foreigners in selected OECD countries : effectiveness of national policies and action for cooperation at the international level " .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
Concerned that implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform for Action remains far from the objectives set forth in the two documents and , therefore , calls once again for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status and human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms ;  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aiming at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Although his Government was encouraged by the level of dialogue that it had developed with Cuba , it remained concerned about the lack of respect for the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens , as illustrated recently by the treatment of independent journalists in Cuba and the arrests of four human rights activists .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
The charge for programme support costs for non-reimbursable loans is generally calculated on the basis of requirements for standard common services costs for a staff member at the P-3 / P-4 level , as follows : maintenance and rental of premises , utilities and office supplies ; maintenance of office automation equipment ; telecommunications ; secretarial and administrative support ( generally calculated at five personnel to one General Service staff ) ; and medical services .  
Although the Advisory Committee appreciated that the overall level of peacekeeping activity would decline as more and more missions were liquidated , it had concluded that there were a number of shortcomings in the Secretariat 's analysis of the workload of peacekeeping missions , for it had had difficulty relating the Secretary-General 's proposals for net additional posts to the actual or projected workload .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
The agreed conclusions on women in power and decision-making placed an emphasis on conflict resolution , peace and security matters , and the promotion of gender balance at all levels of national diplomatic service , including the ambassadorial level . 4 For example , Governments and the United Nations system were called upon to promote women 's active and equal participation as governmental and non-governmental representatives , special rapporteurs and envoys in all of their initiatives and activities , including as mediators for peacekeeping and peace-building . 
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
If it is committed by any State body or official , acting within its / his authority or ultra vires , it is considered to be an act by the State ( regardless whether it is suitable for discussion at the international level ) . 
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
It concluded that the resource targets , including existing operational practices and levels of financing and operational and administrative costs , were not based on quantifiable needs of recipient countries , and that there were no workable methods available at the global level .  
In the Turks and Caicos Islands , technical cooperation has been largely aimed at direct interventions with a view to laying the basis for meaningful economic development .  In this connection , assistance was granted for the establishment of an investment agency , the creation of a national insurance scheme , and to improve customs administration and tertiary level education .  
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
In view of the experience gained during the events of August 1996 and the subsequent prolonged state of alert , I have requested the contributors of infantry units to increase their strength by a total of 63 personnel all ranks , bringing UNFICYP 's strength to its authorized level .  28 .  Mr . Han Sung-Joo requested that his appointment as my Special Representative for Cyprus not be extended beyond its expiration in April 1997 .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
Also , because meetings are not scheduled in Vienna throughout the year and permanent capacity is not fully utilized , and in view of the possible introduction of remote interpretation , it is proposed to maintain permanent interpretation capacity at the minimum level consistent with required language combinations .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Because multilateral funding is declining and there is a tendency to become more dependent on directed multilateral contributions , WFP is intensifying its efforts to secure resources at the field level by ensuring that donor representatives are well informed of WFP activities and by broadening its donor base for the long term .  
IACWGE has taken steps to ensure that the outputs of the task forces , such as their final reports or the guidelines for resident representatives , fully reflect a gender perspective , including direct or indirect participation in the discussions of case studies at the country level ( see ACC / 1996 / 22 , para . 31 ) ( see also the report of ACC on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up to the major United Nations conferences and summits ( E / 1997 / ) ) . 
As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
With regard to the follow-up to Habitat II , ACC , at its first regular session for 1997 , decided that the arrangements should focus on supporting country-level action and coordination and should involve the development of guidelines to orient the resident coordinator system in establishing country-level thematic groups and strengthening implementation and monitoring at the national and local level .  
At the country level , the General Assembly , in paragraph 39 of its resolution 50 / 120 , acknowledged the role of the resident coordinators in facilitating , in full consultation with national Governments , a coherent and coordinated United Nations follow-up to major international conferences at the field level .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
The enormous challenges facing the housing sector and human settlements at the global level required new and more efficient modalities of international cooperation , including the dissemination of the " best practices " , as well as the political will of States to adopt appropriate measures in that area .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
It was agreed at Rio that the developed countries were to bring the level of their official development assistance to the nominal level of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and that sufficient resources were to be mobilized by each country and by the international community , including both the public and private sectors , for the survival of our planet Earth .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
The report says that a change of this magnitude requires a package of measures that combine : ( a ) the strengthening of tax administration ; ( b ) the expansion of the tax base and the revision of the principal taxes ; and ( c ) the creation of a team that is committed to reform , supported at the highest political level and backed by a solid social consensus .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
They shall take joint actions in international financial and economic organizations with a view to ensuring appropriate funding for projects agreed on at the trilateral level , including requests to make use of the European Union 's integrated international assistance programmes , such as Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) , as well as appropriate programmes within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
At the operational level , the United Nations Special Commission has continued its tasks of verifying the destruction of Iraq 's proscribed weapons and capabilities and of operating a system of ongoing monitoring of its compliance with its obligation not to acquire such weapons or capabilities in the future ( see S / 1997 / 301 , annex ) .  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
As a follow-up to commitment 3 made at the Social Summit to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , 5 the Secretariat organized a one-day seminar on world employment strategy to discuss the Report on World Employment 1996 / 97 issued by the International Labour Office , and to reflect on policies that may contribute to improving employment projects at the national and international level .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
Side by side with measures to introduce new information technologies , for example using the Internet and CD-ROMs to offer comprehensive information about the United Nations and its work to a wider audience , it was essential to continue supporting and using various traditional mass media such as printed matter , radio and television , bearing in mind the diversity and different level of development of countries around the world .  
At the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the question of public administration and development had been considered , with a high level of representation and participation ; it was regrettable that the resolution adopted on the subject reflected only partially the valuable ideas and suggestions presented by delegations . 
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
Given that each country was responsible for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the national level , the Philippines had elaborated a national plan of action that dovetailed with all other national economic and social development plans , including programmes for the eradication of poverty , for the environment , for women and for children , with a view to improving the quality of life of the rural and urban population . 
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
At the national level , that decision had been expressed in the processes of trade liberalization , privatization , macroeconomic stabilization , modernization of the public sector , combating corruption , reduction or elimination of public deficits and more efficient use of public resources .  At the international level , MERCOSUR was a basic element in the strategy for dynamic integration of the economies of its members into the global context and for peace-building in the region .  
In that connection , his delegation was deeply concerned that , using the pretext of freedom , democracy or the environment , laws were being promulgated and unilateral restrictions were being imposed which undermined free trade and violated international law and the trading practices negotiated at the multilateral level . 
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
The new initiatives announced by the Bretton Woods institutions in April 1996 provided a framework for easing the burden of external debt and , coupled with assistance to debtor countries in implementing structural adjustment programmes , might help to bring debt to an acceptable level , to regain investor confidence and to reverse the negative development trends in that group of countries . 
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
These are , in particular : political leaders , members of Government and of parliament and of other elected bodies ; teaching staff at every level of educational systems and those engaged in non-formal education of children and adults ; journalists ; members of the intellectual community as a whole ; religious leaders ; those having managerial functions at various levels ; non-governmental organizations , especially of women and youth .  
The centres would develop train the trainer programmes to train peace promoters in the region concerned and to monitor and support their peace promotion work on a long-term basis , producing ultimately a diverse and flexible network of peace promoters around the world , connected by modern communication technology , for the exchange of information and experience in building a culture of peace at the local and regional level .  
The commitment made at Copenhagen to eradicate poverty in the world also called for action at the international level to ensure that policies and programmes will advance the attainment of agreed developmental goals that are aimed at meeting basic needs for all and eradicating absolute poverty ; the participation of the people concerned is an integral part in this endeavour .  
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
This was an important meeting devoted to follow-up of the Fourth World Conference on Women and was an unprecedented event at the international level since it brought together an equal number of men and women members of parliament from some 80 countries and provided the occasion for innovative debates on ways of ensuring the joint exercise of political responsibilities .  
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
Further , the humanitarian considerations that the Holy See applies to economic sanctions were articulated by His Eminence Angelo Cardinal Sodano , Secretary of State , who stated that the Holy See hoped that the Security Council would be better informed about the negative effects , on a humanitarian level , deriving from the application of sanctions imposed on a State in strict application of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
Finally , for module four , covering demand reduction , the following areas will be of main interest : establishment of a subregional coordination mechanism at policy and operational levels ; harmonization of legislation ; promotion of information exchange at the subregional level ; assessment of illicit demand and sharing of experience in prevention and treatment ; joint training activities ; and harmonization of licit control of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors .  
Finally , at the regional level , joint training in investigation techniques ( profiling , search methods , controlled deliveries etc . ) will be organized , and a framework for periodic consultations on operational issues ( trends , concealment methods etc . ) will be set up .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
In tandem with the premium that new permanent members will enjoy as incumbents , this low level of support required will virtually ensure the automatic extension of new permanent members , rendering a periodic review meaningless .

At the national level , over the past 10 years , his Government had substantially increased domestic resources for development financing , but it continued to need external resources , both private and official , in order to sustain current growth rates .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .

The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .

We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
A critical test of the seriousness of our rededication to the implementation of Agenda 21 in 1997 will be the extent to which we can obtain a firmer commitment from developed countries to reverse the decline in official aid flows and to reach the accepted United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product , and to replenish and significantly increase the level of the Global Environment Facility funds .  
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .

Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
For the forest sector to become relatively more effective and influential and attract more resources , international and regional institutions and bilateral donors with coordination units at the national level would have to be engaged .  
The lack of political commitment was also identified by a few responses , leading to protracted , artificial and unnecessary international negotiations without any concrete results , especially at the field level .

Likewise , when we are aware of the zeal with which alleged terrorists are tracked down , in every corner of the globe , it is difficult to understand why , despite the tireless appeals launched by the overwhelming majority of States , nothing significant has ever been carried out at the national level to prevent the recruitment and use of mercenaries , which , as has been proved , contributes to the flouting of the rules of international humanitarian law . 
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .

On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
As for the acts committed ( factor a above ) , the historical and evidentiary record suggests cases of murder ( rising to the level of extermination of political opposition ) , forced labour , torture and other inhumane acts .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
It keeps the statistical records of complaints received , the types of human rights violated , the acts of violation and those alleged to be responsible for the violations , whether at the national level or for each of the departments in which there are area offices .  
The survey was conducted at the national level using a sample of 10,000 households ( 6,000 urban and 4,000 rural ) , arranged in a random selection in three stages , with probability proportional to size .

Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Therefore the primary focus of operational activities must continue to be at the country level , with national Governments assuming the main responsibility for coordinating development assistance programming , which , in turn , must be based on the national development plans and priorities of those countries .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .

In some common law jurisdictions , arbitrators may enjoy a high level of immunity more akin to a judge , while in others a distinction is drawn between those acts of an arbitrator which are adjudicatory , and thus entitled to this high standard of immunity , and those acts which are unrelated to any adjudicatory function and thus subject to civil liability .  
A genuine commitment of all concerned parties at the national as well as the international level is needed to ensure a routine flow of reliable statistics and indicators at the country level , which meets national needs for information , and for the integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences and summits .

These narrative standards , giving examples of typical duties at each level , assist in indicating how the master standard should be applied in making meaningful distinctions between levels of work within an organization and in assigning proper grade levels to similar functions across organizations .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that the post had been classified internally at the P-5 level in 1992 and that the current classification action had been initiated in view of the managerial responsibilities of the post , which had grown with the increasing use of contractual services , involving an annual average of some 45,000 pages and an annual budget in excess of $ 1-million .

The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Such a categorical rejection would create more confusion in respect of the applicable law in case of actual damage or harm occurring across international borders or at the global level because of activities pursued or permitted by States within their territory or other areas under their exclusive jurisdiction and control .  
A unilateral act formulated by a person who can not be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose and to engage it at the international level is without legal effect unless expressly confirmed by that State .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
As a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , Malaysia was committed to improving the situation of children at the domestic level , and for that purpose had promulgated laws and formulated programmes , such as the seventh Malaysia plan , designed to further improve the education system , inculcate good values among children and parents and create a society in which care and love for children were given strong emphasis .  
In Nairobi , the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meeting with Sudanese women of various ethnic , religious and political backgrounds who , within their respective organizations and through the implementation of different projects involving and empowering women at the grass-roots level , are making their own valuable contribution towards the common goal of peace-making and building in the Sudan .  
At the international level , a main objective of development assistance should be to support national efforts for sustained human capital formation .  
On 9 March 1999 , the oil overseers informed the Security Council Committee that during the second half of phase V the increase in the total level of exports , accompanied by the corresponding exports from both the north and the south of Iraq , had led to an increase in the share of crude oil exported from Mina al-Bakr .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
The work of the various thematic groups , organized around specific cross-cutting themes emerging from the international programmes , should now be further integrated to ensure a more comprehensive approach to conference follow-up , facilitating the development of a corresponding integrated follow-up at the national level .  
This will provide an obvious opportunity for country teams , which so desire , to pursue several objectives at the same time lightening the burden on national officials by having fewer evaluations , concentrating on fewer and more important issues and using only one set of procedures ; increasing focus on , and understanding at the national level , of the overall contribution of the United Nations system ; economizing on scarce resources allocated for monitoring and evaluation .  
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
The serious intent of the Indonesian Government to fulfil its commitment is also evidenced by the establishment of a special task force at the ministerial level on 11 May 1999 , to monitor and ensure the safe and peaceful implementation of the popular consultation to be held under United Nations auspices .  
I urge the Council to endorse the electoral support plan submitted by MINURCA , which is based on the minimum that is required , in the difficult circumstances prevailing within the Central African Republic , to ensure an acceptable level of observation of the freedom and fairness of the election process .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
Efforts have included a series of guides to the strategic planning process for a national response to HIV / AIDS which is a flexible tool designed to meet the dual requirement of use at a central and at a district or community level .  
The evaluation highlights the advantages of the reproductive health approach in HIV / AIDS prevention and identifies among its key recommendations the need to strengthen technical capacity at the country level to promote a focused , appropriate and efficient response to the epidemic ; to make condom provision even more central to HIV / AIDS strategies ; and to strengthen further activities for young people .  
Results confirm that despite continuing challenges , progress has been made by UNAIDS and its co-sponsors at the country level and that the theme groups on HIV / AIDS provide an effective way of coordinating financial and technical support to the national response to AIDS , encouraging teamwork and providing a forum for advocacy and interaction with bilateral agencies , non-governmental organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS .  
Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
Where the total net remuneration before promotion of a staff member in the General Service and related categories exceeds that at the Professional level before promotion , established in accordance with subparagraph ( d ) above , a personal transitional allowance in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of subparagraph ( a ) will be paid until such time as it is overtaken by increases in net remuneration at the Professional level .  
The Secretary-General may , in exceptional and compelling circumstances , authorize a reasonable increase in the travel subsistence allowance to be paid to a staff member who is required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that his or her additional living expense be established at a rate substantially higher than that contemplated in setting the allowance rate for his or her level .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
Also notes the need to secure the participation of a diverse range of stakeholders drawn from government , non-governmental organizations , academia , centres of excellence , professional bodies and business enterprises in a partnership arrangement aimed at providing an integrated environmental information service at the national level , and encourages Governments to establish these partnerships under a formal agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme ;  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
Among them are retrievable scientific experiment satellites that are in the front rank of advanced technologies in the world , communication broadcasting satellites that have reached the level of medium capacity and geostationary meteorological satellites that have attained the international standards of the early 1990s .  
While the distinction was considered of some use in the interpretation of primary rules in an explanatory , didactic sense , doubts were expressed as to whether it should be included in a codification of the law of State responsibility , and if so , whether it could be made operational at the level of secondary rules .  
If the distinction had become commonplace in international law at the doctrinal level , it would be worthwhile searching for further applications of the concept , for example , by considering areas such as the law of the sea , environmental law and diplomatic law .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
The leaders of the world therefore pledged their political will and their common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries , with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half the 1996 level no later than the year 2015 .  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
It sets out the normative content of the human right to adequate food , the corresponding obligations including State obligations at the national level and at the international level , the responsibilities of international organizations , and regulation of economic enterprises and other actors .  
Without energetic implementation both at the national and the international level , however , the insight gained will not lead to the aims set ; at a minimum this includes the reduction of the number of undernourished people to half their 1996 level by 2015 .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
employ personnel which possesses the expert knowledge , experience , and qualifications necessary for the offered services , in particular competence at the managerial level , expertise in electronic signature technology and familiarity with proper security procedures ; they must also exercise administrative and management procedures and processes that are adequate and which correspond to recognised standards ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
It also calls for upgrading the level of knowledge of the multi-ethnic people to create a professional labour force of individuals with the capacity to meet the urgent needs of national development in the immediate future and to solve various social problems concurrently with economic expansion .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The second governmental track is guarantees of basic education , especially for girls and female adolescents inside and outside cities and in rural areas , as it has been proved that increasing the educational level of women greatly influences their approach to family planning , their sexual behaviour , their health condition in general , the health of their children and family and their first pregnancy , among other elements .  
They should be comprehensive in their approach , while allowing for the flexible use of policy instruments in accordance with specific national and sectoral conditions , including those in the rural sector , and should be pursued , as appropriate , at national and international level with a particular focus on :  
These include ( a ) strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing distortions so as to encourage private sector investment ; ( b ) improving the quality of government spending in order to invest in basic social services and raise the level of human capital ; and ( c ) rationalizing the assistance provided by external donors .  
The view was expressed that the decision on ratification as well as on rationalization and adaptation of the human rights machinery at the national level was the prerogative of individual sovereign countries rather than an initiative taken by the departments concerned .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
UNHCR has actively worked , at the level of law , to ensure wider acceptance of the notion that persecution may be effected through sexual violence , as well as of the notion that women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society , may be considered as a " particular social group " within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention .  
Plans of action have been established at country operational level , focussing on key areas requiring protection and assistance measures ; sexual exploitation and violence ; under-age military recruitment ; education ; and unaccompanied minors and adolescents ; all of which are fundamental to addressing the needs of girls more effectively .  
The fund was established with a base level of US $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
While sharing the concern expressed by some delegations at the third annual sessions 1997 and 1998 that the 4 per cent level of the reserve may be too low , the Executive Director has concluded that the first priority for UNOPS in the current and next bienniums is the restoration of the operational reserve to its level as presently prescribed .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .  
At the functional level , UNMIK has established joint civilian commissions ( JCCs ) to facilitate the process of a mediated and controlled transition to integrated public institutions and to address such contentious issues as administration and staffing of various public facilities . 
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
Takes note of the efforts already made to strengthen field-level coordination and the role of the resident coordinator system , and encourages further steps towards greater collaboration , at the field level , by ensuring well _ functioning , highly participatory and active country teams , and full consultation with the Governments concerned , while respecting the specific identities and mandates of United Nations operational activities ;  
In any legislative , administrative or other measures taken at the national , regional or international level , it should be ensured that the principles listed below are strictly observed :  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
It was also noted in that regard that focal points could be responsible for following-up on the implementation of any joint programmes , conducting direct informal contacts on activities and issues of common interest , investigating and exploring possibilities and means of exchanging information , consultations concerning early signs of potential crises and conflicts and holding periodic consultative meetings between staff at the working level to exchange views .  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The NGO community , which has contributed enormously to strengthening the human rights regime , especially regarding civil and political rights , is now moving enthusiastically to operate at the grass _ roots level to deliver economic , social and cultural rights .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
At the inter-agency level , ongoing measures to enhance programme complementarity need to be accompanied by a renewed effort at identifying and focusing on common priority objectives and priority themes ; developing joint arrangements to respond to emerging requirements ; and concerting overall policies and strategies . 
Among the issues that require detailed discussion are the division of labour between the United Nations and ECOWAS , the need to provide a credible level of security throughout the country ( including the rebel-controlled areas ) , the appropriate size and composition of the required neutral peacekeeping force , the deployment of units to the various regions of the country and arrangements for logistical support .  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
The background to this actuarial assumption was described in the report of the Board to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session . 3 At its meetings in 1997 and 1998 , the Committee of Actuaries considered the methodology for determining the level of administrative expenses to be assumed in the actuarial valuations , taking into account that the number of retirees continued to grow at a greater rate than that of active participants . 
In its 1998 report to the General Assembly , the Board agreed with the view taken by the Committee of Actuaries that the administrative expenses to be included in the valuations should be based on the level of resources required to administer the Fund ( excluding investment costs which are a charge against investment income ) , as contained in its approved budgets , rather than by establishing a predetermined ratio between the administrative expenses and the level of pensionable remuneration .  
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Regarding the new method proposed by the Director-General for mobilizing funds for the implementation of UNIDO services , his delegation felt that the proposed approach would be helpful in raising the level of so-called voluntary contributions and it considered that mobilization efforts would be further assisted through the creation of an informal open-ended working group with the mandate of establishing more effective strategies to that end .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
It was worth noting that the decision had been taken by the Netherlands Embassy in Ethiopia , in close consultation with the Ethiopian authorities , since development experts in the field had concluded that UNIDOs new approach could make a difference at local level , and that the integrated programme would help to promote sustainable industrial development .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
With regard to trust , proper legal and regulatory instruments were required at the international level , which would need to be adapted to national specificities .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
The gender relationships associated with other characteristics of LDCs were also discussed : weak infrastructure , environmental degradation , low level of and access to technology , high of unemployment , a small tax base and restricted government revenues / expenditures ; inability to attract full FDI , problems of government , high rates of capital flight and the effects of exogenous factors , such as natural disasters .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
The sustainability of the recent growth performance of the least developed countries would also depend on increasing the level of gross domestic saving and gross domestic investment , the supply of critical skills and consolidation of political and macroeconomic stability .  
At the national level , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups continued to be the principal means of policy dialogue , for coordinating the aid efforts of development partners and mobilizing the required resources for the implementation of the development programmes of the least developed countries concerned .  
As a share of the combined GNP of the donor countries members of OECD / DAC , total ODA has fallen for five consecutive years , from 0.33 per cent in 1992 the level maintained during the first three years of the decade to 0.22 per cent in 1997 , the lowest ratio recorded since 1970 when the United Nations adopted the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of donor country GNP . 
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The primary aim of the latter project will be a global report on organized crime , to be published every two years , which will provide qualitative and quantitative information on trends in organized crime activities and structures of groups operating at the international level ; types and distribution of illicit markets ; major international initiatives ; and developments in national legislation against organized crime .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
A United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF ) nutrition survey , conducted in April and May , confirmed that overall nutritional standards in Bahr Al Ghazal had improved , but from a very low initial level : the average global malnutrition rate , in fact , was 22 per cent .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
The profile should contain data on non-governmental organization participation such as geographical distribution : national , regional , international ; functional specialization ; size ; duration of existence and so on , as part of a system of frequent data gathering about non-governmental organization activities and their level of cooperation with the United Nations .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Notes with appreciation the efforts of those Governments that have maintained , maintained at a high level or increased their contributions to UNDP , and encourages all Governments in a position to do so to increase their contributions and / or meet their existing commitments to UNDP and to help to put UNDP funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and to reach the annual funding target of $ 1.1-billion ;  
He notes that low levels of disbursement , especially at the local level , continue to erode the already modest share of the national budget allocated to the health sector , and draws attention to the fact that the gap between the budget allocated and actual expenditure is highest for the operating expenses of rural health services , crucial for the well-being of the population .  
This Conference , which is part of IPUs action to channel parliamentary support to the United Nations , can be a major milestone in efforts made to enhance the peoples understanding of and support to the United Nations through their elected representatives and in identifying ways of relaying United Nations decisions and recommendations more efficiently at the national political level for their effective follow-up .  
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives : concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level , particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums ; cooperation , particularly in the economic , social , cultural , legal and scientific spheres ; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language .  
At the political and diplomatic level , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has enhanced extensive and permanent contacts among the seven lusophone countries , aimed at an effective and coherent approach in the international arena .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
At the current level of knowledge , the problem is still very much open-ended ; the available methodological approaches do not provide straightforward and unequivocal assessments ; and in the absence of sound and indisputable estimates , the level of subjective judgement is often above an acceptable threshold .  
The Albanian State expects that in the near future the Balkans will become a democratic region with an economy intended to reach the level of those of the developed countries , a region that respects human rights , in accordance with advanced European and global standards .  
In the absence of minimal harmonization at the international level , national laws applicable through conflicts rules might thus impose extremely harsh standards that could potentially affect the growth and the global availability of electronic commerce techniques .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
To further improve strategic coordination at the field level , the Secretariat has developed a note of guidance clarifying the relations between the humanitarian coordinator and my special representative , conforming to principles set out in my directive on the responsibilities of special representatives .  
The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
This should be applied not only at the national level but also internationally , since the international decision-making process has become less democratic and transparent , leading to the marginalization of the vast majority of the worlds people .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using special investigative techniques at the international level .  
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
For the purpose of investigating the crimes [ covered by this Convention ] [ established in articles . . . of this Convention ] , States Parties are encouraged to make , when necessary , appropriate bilateral or multilateral arrangements for using such special investigative techniques in the context of cooperation at the international level .  
In particular , given the unsatisfactory nutritional situation prevalent in Iraq and the necessity of providing a full food basket on a monthly basis , and also taking into account the effects of the current drought , it is essential to keep under constant review the funding level of the food sector .  
While welcoming the Government 's proposed modest increase in the target caloric value of the food basket to 2,200 kilocalories per person per day , in view of the additional funds available , the Secretary-General recommends that the caloric value of the food basket should be increased at the minimum to 2,300 kilocalories per person per day country-wide , which was the level approved for the enhanced distribution plan for phase IV ( S / 1998 / 446 ) .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;

The United States of America , as a permanent member of the Security Council , had a special responsibility towards the Organization ; it was also the sole beneficiary of the 25-per-cent ceiling on contributions to the regular budget , with the result that its assessment level was considerably lower than its share of global gross national product ( GNP ) .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Apart from universal adherence to the 11 existing international counter-terrorism conventions , along with adherence to various legal instruments adopted at the regional level , new legal instruments are needed to counter specific forms and manifestations of terrorism .

Developed countries should energetically pursue economic policies conducive to the healthy long-term development of all countries and cooperate actively with developing countries in formulating effective policy measures at both the national and the international level .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
UNCTAD should do analytical work and provide a forum for exchanges of experiences at intergovernmental and at expert level on the formulation of policies favourable to the development of the private sector at local , national and regional levels .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
These challenges called for a holistic approach , as the social , economic , cultural and environmental aspects of development were interdependent , and for more creative international cooperation based on internal democracy , fair external relations and the will to act at the appropriate level depending on the nature of the problem .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
His delegation was surprised at the contradictory approaches taken on national and international issues ; although the principles of democracy , popular participation , the rule of law , responsibility and equity were said to be necessary prerequisites for the rational management of a countrys internal affairs , they were not being applied at the international level . 
His Government was convinced that development required , at the national level , the development of sound economic policy , respect for the rule of law , promotion of the private sector , accountability and transparency in public affairs .  
At the national level , it supported budget and assistance reviews leading to policy dialogue on basic social services ; at the international level , it coordinated United Nations efforts to promote the 20 / 20 Initiative and had assisted the Governments of the Netherlands , Norway and Viet Nam in organizing two international meetings on its implementation , one in Oslo in 1996 and one in Hanoi in 1998 .  
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs encouraged citizens to establish voluntary organizations to meet the needs of individuals and groups at the local level , and there were 142 such charitable societies that received annual subsidies from the Government .  
Among the social and economic measures and policies aimed at developing its human resources , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya provided education to all free of charge until completion of the elementary level , free health services , and free social security services for widows , disabled persons and the elderly .  
The Communications Unit has an authorized staffing level comprising one Chief of Communications ( P-4 ) , one associate communications officer ( P-2 ) , thirteen Field Service posts ( 5 radio technicians , 1 operator , 3 audio-visual engineers , 1 mechanic , 1 electrician , 1 logistics assistant and 1 switching engineer ) ; seven General Service ( Local level ) posts ( 1 Secretary , 3 switchboard operators , 3 sound technicians ) .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .

At the legislative level , womens civil status continued to be restricted ; despite the ratification of international instruments , the offending provisions in the laws had not been amended .  
The question of increasing the level of commitment authority granted to the Secretary-General , without the prior concurrence of the Committee , for unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures was raised in a report submitted to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( see A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) .  
Recognizes the importance of adopting appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , in order to realize the objective of eradicating poverty ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
The Special Rapporteur received excellent cooperation from the Government in the way of availability of most of the senior and other responsible officials he sought to meet , up to and including ministerial level .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
To achieve the objective of promoting , on a horizontal and integrated perspective , equality among men and women in measures and actions , in work , employment and at the professional training level , the measures for affirmative action must be considered implicit in the first three pillars referred to above .  
Sharing experiences and information , improving capacity of responding to the specific needs of women within the environment where they operate , improve the quality of the actions developed and , so that they can work in articulation with the Commission , as well as in cooperation with social and economical agents at the councils level , namely employment centres and enterprises for equal opportunity .  
The proper place for paragraph 3 of article 19 is within the context of prevention at the international and not the national level , for the following reasons : firstly , this provision uses words such as States Parties shall cooperate , pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements , exchange information and coordinate administrative and other measures , which clearly indicate the international dimension of its subject matter .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
In their discussions with the Special Rapporteur , government officials , private individuals and members of non-governmental organizations generally agreed that there had been a gradual change in the attitude of some of the government actors , from the federal to the municipal level , who were now more inclined towards improving the overall human rights performance of public institutions and agencies .  
In a pessimistic scenario , increased pressure for an expanded role would undercut the WTOs already precarious level of political support , threatening existing international openness .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
There continued to be widespread manifestations of disguised and increasingly sophisticated forms of racism , racial discrimination and xenophobia in the world , particularly in regions with a high level of economic development , a fact that had been recognized and denounced in various forums .  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
The Advisory Committee notes the statement , in paragraph 4 of the note by the Secretary-General , that general temporary assistance , in addition to being used to replace staff on maternity or sick leave or to ensure adequate staffing during peak workload periods , is used to fund specific positions which are associated with some degree of uncertainty as to the need for them to be retained in the definite future , either at their current level or in their current pattern of grades and categories . 
In its concern for a safe environment , the Council gave instructions for the creation of an effective mechanism to coordinate the action of ministries and other relevant agencies at the national level in each member State in taking proper measures to dispose of medical waste and process radioactive waste and also to coordinate the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste .  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,

17 .  Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;  
Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Emphasizing the fact that the realization of the right to development requires effective and efficient development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Urges States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , inter alia , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating those rights into development activities and promoting effective international cooperation ;  
Also notes that debt relief alone will not lead to poverty reduction , and in this regard , emphasizes the need for an enabling environment as well as for an efficient , transparent and accountable public service and administration , and also emphasizes the urgency of securing an adequate level of funding support for debt relief , in particular the agreement for an overall financing plan for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative ;  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The establishment or maintenance , for religious or linguistic reasons , of separate educational systems or institutions offering an education which is in keeping with the wishes of the pupils parents or legal guardians , if participation in such systems or attendance at such institutions is optional and if the education provided conforms to such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level ;  
The establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions , if the object of the institutions is not to secure the exclusion of any group but to provide educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities , if the institutions are conducted in accordance with that object , and if the education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the competent authorities , in particular for education of the same level .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Current international economic relations , being based on a unipolar policy and attempts by many wealthy States to impose an economic system or systems at the international level solely with a view to furthering their own interests , cause severe economic crises in the developing countries and are highly detrimental to the realization of the right to development .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
In particular , the initial proposals submitted in response to the programme framework on childrens health indicate a marked improvement in both the quality of the projects received as well as in the level of cooperation demonstrated by entities of the United Nations system in designing joint submissions .  
Also notes that debt relief alone will not lead to poverty reduction , and in this regard emphasizes the need for an enabling environment as well as for an efficient , transparent and accountable public service and administration , and also emphasizes the urgency of securing an adequate level of funding support for debt relief , in particular the agreement for an overall financing plan for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative ;  
So the systemic contest was founded on a similar set of proclaimed values or objectives : rationality , efficiency and equity on a general level , and modernization , growth and an improved living standard for the majority on a more concrete level .  
Each of the two competing and opposing systemic families was faced with a specific , endogenous and major adaptation crisis , with both crises interacting at the international level .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Likewise , on the future of the regional bureaux , I am convinced of the need for strong regional representation at the level of Assistant Secretary-General in New York and I intend to select and recommend to the Secretary-General senior figures to fill the posts that are currently vacant .  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
Participants were professionals at the level of director and senior programme managers associated with or responsible for safety issues in connection with operating airlines of their country ; the countrys maritime agency and port authorities ; the geological survey and land survey departments ; the telecommunications industry ; or the national disaster management board or bureau .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Indeed , numerous unilateral acts , whatever their content , could be classified as political , while certain unilateral acts not originally intended to have legal effects at the international level could have such effects .  
It is anticipated that the revised programme of work as decided by the ninth session of the Conference can be implemented within the reduced level of resources , utilizing , inter alia , the gains from the efficiency review , which is currently ongoing . "  
Acknowledges the need for States to address the problem of misuse or abuse of refugee status determination procedures , both at the national level and through international cooperation , and urges States to ensure that national law and administrative practices , including migration control measures , are compatible with the principles and standards of applicable refugee and human rights law , as set out in relevant international instruments ;  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
For areas considered non-core ( i.e . , not essential for regulation at the central common system level ) , guidelines set by ICSC could be desirable .  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
My country is fully convinced that States play a great role in activating social development at the local level and in creating an enabling environment , thus implementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing social development on a strong foundation of human rights , non-discrimination , pursuit of equal opportunities and the realization of social justice .  
Bearing in mind a steady tendency towards globalization at the international level , coupled with that of liberalization and economic reform at the national level , it is time to enhance international cooperation based on the principles of non-discrimination , open competitiveness , partnership and mutual benefit .  
A continued selective and preferential approach in the level of response to one region or another , with regard to humanitarian situations in the world , would only subject the concept of humanitarian security and forceful intervention to humanitarian justifications and to doubts about the credibility of the real motives and objectives .  
These are , at the political level , the quest for peace with a view to bringing about a better and more united world ; at the economic level , the promotion of genuine development for the benefit of all countries and all peoples , which is a sine qua non condition for the establishment of the true collective security to which we all aspire ; and , at the social level , human freedom through the promotion of human security . 
The declared objective of the Convention is the achievement and preservation worldwide of a high level of nuclear safety through increased implementation of national measures and international cooperation .  
While the donor response to the appeals made by the OCHA has improved , the European Union remains concerned at the insufficient level of funding received by OCHA from the regular budget , in particular the uneven balance between regular budget posts and those funded from extra-budgetary sources . 
This hurricane is unusual not only for its lateness and ferocious winds , but also because it spreads its force selectively and has caused sea level rise and huge , mountainous waves that have completely destroyed the coastal area in my country and others , where the population is concentrated . 
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that it is necessary to strengthen and extend every possible form of cooperation among all countries within the framework of mutual respect , respect for international law and the relevant international conventions , in order to ensure , at the international level , the protection and restoration of archaeological , historical and cultural treasures .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
In this connection , we appeal also for resolute action by Governments to strengthen their political will in respect of establishing effective and transparent partnerships , both at the national level with civil society and at the bilateral level .  
We are creating opportunities to advance by improving the educational level of the population , continuing educational reform , expanding coverage and enhancing quality at all levels , particularly in rural and suburban areas .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
Unfortunately , we all know that the commitments undertaken in the Convention were not sufficient to meet its ultimate objective , which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
These States are confronted with major challenges , such as protecting the marine environment against various forms of pollution , the increasing scarcity of fresh water , ever more frequent and devastating natural disasters , adapting to climate change and to the rising sea level , integrating into the global economy , and the diversification of their exports .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Create and or encourage the creation and strengthening of institutional mechanisms at all levels , including taking all measures to ensure that national machineries as well as focal points within specific institutions are not marginalized in the administrative structure but supported at the highest possible level of government and entrusted with clearly defined mandates which define their function as a policy advisory body ;  
Representatives agreed that the creation of an enabling environment that includes a legislative framework and political commitment at the highest level is a prerequisite for effective social change and improvement in womens health .  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
We view that in the present era of diversity and change and of challenge of traditional concepts , the rule calculated to promote the widest possible acceptance of common agreement and expressed in a multilateral instrument may be the one better suited to the immediate needs of the international community which allows for qualified permissibility and maintains progressive development towards the eventual elimination of compelling conditions that rendered reservations on the national level .  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
The Committee considered that , since the EVI could give only a partial and approximate measure of the relative level of vulnerability of a country , a document to be called a country vulnerability profile should be prepared , for some countries , to provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of external economic and natural shocks on their economic performance and economic structure .  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
The purpose of the 1991 revised criteria for least developed country status was to designate those low-income countries that were suffering from a low level of human resources and from structural weaknesses , specifically as reflected in a low degree of economic diversification .  
The Chairperson reiterated his concern about the persistent lack of recognition of economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to education , as human rights , not only at the national level but also in various international entities .

It was considered that the narrative should have included references to the effects of endemic structural adjustments and to the negative impact of the economic crisis at the international level which affected developing countries .  
The report demonstrates that coordinated implementation of the environmental conventions is essential at the local level , where it is possible to make a significant difference and where tangible benefits are not only easily achievable but also demonstrable .  
All States participating in the negotiations expressed their determination to deny safe havens to those who engaged in transnational organized crime by prosecuting their crimes wherever they occurred and by cooperating at the international level .  
Effective resolution of the formidable problems faced by those countries requires serious consideration , at a high political level , of concerted national , regional and international policies and measures in their favour .  
The highestlevel representatives of the international community confirmed , during that historic event , that the United Nations is continuing to play a central role in ensuring peace and stability on both the global and regional level .  
In order to be effective , DMOs have to be representative of relevant stakeholders at the local level , institutionally established and provided with the necessary human , financial and logistical resources .  
Member States were encouraged to attend the special session with representation at the highest level , to designate representatives to the preparatory process and to articulate a visionary but feasible agenda for African children over the next decade .  
The formula of success is straightforward : zero tolerance for violence combined with a high level of openness towards legitimate differences in political views and transparent accountability in a credible court , national or international , for serious crimes .  
Crimes were committed with the direct participation of soldiers in active duty , the Interahamwe and political and administrative authorities at the local as well as the national level .  
The conference could be a logical continuation of the global international forum planned for 2001 to mobilize resources for social development and could gear its decisions to meeting urgent needs at the regional and subregional level .  
A total of 104 Local level staff are requested to provide clerical , administrative and technical support for the smooth running of transport operations .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .

The advantages and disadvantages of both courses of action and their widely differing legal , political and moral basis should be recognized , without overlooking the major differences between their application at regional level .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
While the international community played a vital part in humanrights questions , relevant constitutional , legal , administrative and social measures taken at the State level were equally important .

Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that nongovernmental and communitybased organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education , especially at the grassroots level and in remote and rural communities ,  
Building on strong national and regional programmes and on programmes that address key shared and systemic constraints at the global level , UNDP has renewed its commitment to play a lead role in the fight against world poverty .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
That crisis had come as a severe shock after years of rapid growth , and had proved that no country was immune to the contagious consequences of global financial market instability , whatever the strength of its economy or its level of economic growth .  
Clearly , the active and growing participation of the developing countries in trade flows required a competitive economy at the national level , but also a favourable international environment .  
Even with improved pumping capacity and disinfectant supply , the operational capacity of many ( and probably most ) treatment plants is simply inadequate to counter the level of bacterial contamination in the raw water intake .  
The mission also reviewed and assessed the HDI programme more broadly in terms of its effectiveness in pursuing the common goal of addressing the critical humanitarian and basic human needs in Myanmar at the grassroots level .  
In order to be effective , DMOs have to be representative of relevant stakeholders at the local level , institutionally established and provided with the necessary human , financial and logistical resources .

The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
The need to adapt the provisions of domestic and international legal instruments to the specific requirements of electronic commerce has been emerging for some 15 years both at the national level and at the international level .  
It was emphasized that efforts should be made by developed countries to meet as soon as possible the objective to raise the level of official development assistance ( ODA ) to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
In addition to conceptual problems , such as the Committees imprecise mandate in this regard , the definition of groups and a possible double counting as this factor affects the level of gross national product ( GNP ) , it is not clear that sufficient and compatible data is available to study this issue comprehensively .

Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
On the national level , Tunisia has found efficient solutions through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy political , economic , social , cultural and educational as well as strengthening the rule of law and government institutions , thereby distancing ourselves from threats of terrorism and violence .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
Four have been successfully completed ; a further four have been incorporated into other ongoing cases ; six have been discontinued ; and a further 10 have been identified as potentially suitable for prosecution at the national level .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
In its resolution 2000 / 64 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite all States to provide practical examples of activities that have been effective in strengthening good governance practices for the promotion of human rights at the national level , including activities in the context of development cooperation between States , for inclusion in a compilation of indicative ideas and practices that could be consulted by the interested States when required .  
Meetings were held with authorities at the local and national level with the purpose of gathering additional information on allegations , and to assist the authorities in their role of promoting human rights by sharing information on allegations collected by the Office .  
Despite the economic war waged against Cuba for nearly four decades , the position achieved by women in society , their cultural , technical and professional level , their high rates of economic , political and social participation , and the radical changes in their attitudes and lives were significant indicators of social progress .  
Objective : To foster a better understanding of the complex process of policy-making at the national level in a rapidly changing global economic environment .  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
Guatemala continued to cooperate with such machinery in order to strengthen respect for civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights at the international level and implement them at the national level .  
For its part , it had initiated a systematic study of the effects of continuous low level exposure at the cellular , molecular and clinical levels on the health of the population in high natural background radiation areas in the state of Kerala .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
Gravely concerned with the illicit manufacturing , stockpiling of , trafficking in , possession and use of firearms and , especially , those used in the commission of violent crimes and their contribution to the high level of instability , prolonged conflict and social dislocation that is evident in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole ,  
In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
Indeed , there was a strong view put forward during the informal discussions on 26 and 27 February that at this stage , it would only be appropriate to request that the Independent Expert conduct a preliminary study into how such issues are already being addressed at the international level in the development context , to assist the Working Group in its future deliberations as to whether additional work was in fact required .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
They also consider that it is essential to elaborate an integrated scenario for an Arab position in the light of the agreements that will be reached at the meetings of the Arab , African and Islamic environment ministers to be held before the Rio plus 10 conference , given that the unified positions adopted by these ministerial gatherings will have a major impact at the international level .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure , to the maximum extent possible , the survival and development of all children living in Latvia .  
In light of article 4 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that , the State party undertake a study on the impact of the Governments budgetary resources allocated for children and their families in order to assess their effectiveness and to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure the full implementation of the economic , social and cultural rights of children to the maximum extent of available resources , in particular at the local level and with respect to children belonging to the most vulnerable groups in society .  
The Committee is concerned that the principles of non-discrimination ( art . 2 of the Convention ) , best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and respect for the views of the child ( art . 12 ) are not fully reflected in the State partys legislation and political , administrative and judicial decisions , as well as in its policies and programmes relevant to children both at the national and the local level .  
In light of articles 3 , 4 , 6 , 26 and 27 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures , such as the adoption and enforcement of the Programme of Assistance to Families Raising Children , to the maximum extent of its available resources and in particular at the local level , to support families in a difficult economic and / or social situation in order to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of all children living in Lithuania , without discrimination .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
Emphasizing the urgent need for recognition of the collective and shared responsibility of the international community in addressing the root causes of the drug problem and threats related thereto in a comprehensive manner through an intersectoral approach and coordination at the national , regional and international level ,  
That is a severe disappointment , but it was a prudent decision based on the current and growing level of peacekeeping activity and the need for sufficient cash to cover the requirements for these ongoing missions .  
At the operational level , it will be based on regular consultations and information sharing on the priorities established by national Governments and through intergovernmental processes with a view to enabling Africa to derive maximum benefit from the improved coordination of the activities undertaken by the agencies of the United Nations system .  
The increase of $ 141,600 includes the delayed impact of the new posts established in the biennium 2000-2001 and the reclassification of the post of the Chief of the Unit , which is responsible for the implementation of the subprogramme , from the P-5 level to D-1 , to reflect the increased responsibilities of the post and its greater professional interaction at the national , regional , subregional and inter-agency levels .  
The reclassification reflects the substantive nature of the tasks involved , as well as increased responsibilities and greater professional interaction with regional representatives of United Nations programmes and agencies , resident coordinators , high-level government officials at the country level and chief executives and senior staff of the regional economic communities , intergovernmental organizations and NGOs .  
Objective : To promote the development of statistics at the national level and coordinate them at the regional level in order to effectively meet planning , policy-making and administrative requirements for addressing emerging national and regional economic and social priorities .  
Nonetheless , the establishment of such focal points at the national level is a desirable and positive development , as the Commission may wish to reiterate , provided that such an initiative is accompanied by the provision by the national authorities of the minimum required resources , the authority to collect information from the various actors active in the field in the country and the creation of an effective machinery for that purpose .  
The decrease is the net result of the following adjustments : ( a ) the outward redeployment of six posts ( one-P-2 and five General Service ( Other level ) ) to the Library ( Section 2 , General Assembly affairs and conference services ) following the reorganization of that area of activities as detailed above ; ( b ) the conversion of five posts for sound technicians from general temporary assistance to established posts at the General Service level , given the continuous nature of the function .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking ;  
In view of the alarming increase in the illicit manufacture , trafficking and abuse of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS , UNDCP was called upon to give higher priority to supporting Governments to counter the problem posed by those substances at the global level .  
The following priorities were identified during the operational segment : first , increased priority was to be assigned to demand reduction ; secondly , increased support was to be provided to Governments in countering the threat of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS ; and thirdly , at the regional level , increased attention should be given to countering the drug problem in Africa , without neglecting other regions where UNDCP was currently operating .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Although success indicators have been tailored to individual outputs in all the integrated programmes , it was felt that a more systematic approach was needed to obtain more comparable data and also to promote a better understanding with stakeholders at the country level of the expected benefits of the programme .  
The $ 14.9-million level of net approvals reported under this category takes into account only actual payments received ; future year payments under trust fund agreements signed with donors in 2000 ( and therefore not included in net approvals ) amount to $ 7.9-million .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The ongoing efforts at the country level by the UN system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help LDCs translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide a unique process to promote an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
Stresses the crucial role of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement and underlines the obligations of all parties under the Peace Agreement to act in accordance with international human rights law , international humanitarian law and refugee law , and to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including civil and political rights ;  
The review revealed progress in a number of areas , including administrative reform and state modernization at the central level , capacity-building within national institutions for humanitarian coordination and community empowerment to promote participatory local development in selected provinces , with special emphasis on youth and women .  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999 , decided to convene a high-level international intergovernmental event , involving political decision makers at least at ministerial level , to consider national , international and systemic issues relating to financing for development in a holistic manner in the context of globalization and interdependence .  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
At the tenth session of UNCTAD , held in Bangkok in February 2000 , Governments recognized that ensuring that all countries enjoy the benefits of globalization requires meeting complex policy challenges which arise , particularly at the macroeconomic level , from the growing interdependence of the various spheres of economic activity , including particularly trade , finance and investment , and the downside risks that this interdependence sometimes carries . 
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
The programme , by facilitating greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , on adopting a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on adopting more efficient methods of preventing human rights violations and removing obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Activities include improving the quality of education for all children so that learning environments are effective , healthy , protective and gender-sensitive , and each child attains a desired level of achievement upon completion of the basic education cycle .  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
Reaffirms the need for States to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and recognizes the importance of the international community promoting effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development , and also recognizes that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
In the same resolution , the Assembly further decided that the Commission , acting as the Preparatory Committee , should : ( a ) undertake the comprehensive review and assessment of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the other results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ; ( b ) hold three additional sessions , the first and second , to be held in January and March 2002 respectively ; and ( c ) organize the third and final session of the Preparatory Committee at the ministerial level in May 2002 in Indonesia .  
As reported in document DP / 2001 / CRP . 5 , one of the strategies to achieve a higher level of audit coverage has been to encourage government counterparts to use local private audit firms where there is insufficient or limited capacity in the office of the national Auditor General to meet the audit deadline .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment , both at a national and an international level , is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;  
Mindful of the fact that the Asian and Pacific region has two thirds of the worlds population living under the absolute poverty level and the imperative of integrating environmental considerations into economic and social development , the programme will highlight a stronger poverty alleviation thrust , particularly in the areas of social development , population and rural and urban development , and environmental and natural resources management .  
Concern was expressed that , depending on the decisions to be made by the Working Group with respect to articles 2 and 13 , the remainder of the draft provisions might need to be re-examined to avoid creating a situation where the standard set by the uniform rules would apply equally to electronic signatures that ensured a high level of security and to low-value certificates that might be used in the context of electronic communications that were not intended to carry significant legal effect .  
Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
In the light of the achievement of near universal enrolment at the primary level , there has been no need for a concerted effort to establish a system of fundamental education for persons who have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education .  
Objectives : ( a ) helping to raise the level of education and training of the Haitian population through improvements to the education system ; ( b ) supporting the economic and social integration of the population through productive employment and social protection ; ( c ) helping to improve the health of the Haitian population in the areas of reproductive health , sexual and child health and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) / AIDS ; and ( d ) promoting the right to basic social services .  
At the international level , determining change over time and producing comparable regional and global assessments require extensive data assessment and analysis , drawing on detailed data source documentation and expert knowledge .  
It is imperative to secure the achievement of the average level of resources identified in MYFF , especially for regular resources , as they enable the efficient programming of resources to meet ICPD goals .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Executive Heads further recognized that , in order to contribute to progress in achieving the development and poverty eradication goals of the Millennium Summit , the system should strive , at the same time , not only to strengthen country level support but also to enhance policy coherence towards the creation of a more supportive international environment .  This implies contributing to reinforcing the role of the multilateral system in the management of globalization an objective that had found strong reaffirmation at the Summit and also strengthening policy coherence within the system itself .  
At the same time , the efforts of the system to promote more integrated approaches to development for example , a more effective integration of environmental and social dimensions in macroeconomic policies should contribute over time to better balanced decision-making processes also at the national level .  
ACCs contribution to policy coherence and overall progress should not be limited to the elaboration of common , comprehensive approaches to development and the development of a common framework for country level action , but should extend to the identification of global public goods and of the balances and synergies that need to be created among them to strengthen international governance , further policy coherence and advance the goals set at the Summit .  
At the regional level , ECA and ESCAP , in collaboration with the UNAIDS secretariat , have held special events in support of the global initiative and in preparation for the special session of the General Assembly , with ECA having organized an African Development Forum at the highest political level focusing on Africas needs to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
Concluding comments adopted since the Committee revised its format for concluding comments , at its nineteenth session , include a short introductory section , usually no more than three paragraphs , which address the quality of the report , any other documentation submitted by the State party , the nature of the constructive dialogue with the Committee and the level and composition of the delegation .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( i ) macroeconomic policy measures ; ( ii ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level to effect economic transformation , ( iii ) more equitable access to resources , and ( iv ) enhancing the opportunities of the poor .  
Economic sustainability requires action on four fronts : ( a ) macroeconomic policy measures and structural adjustment ; ( b ) efficient resource allocation at the sectoral level ; ( c ) more equitable access to resources , including improving income distribution and striving for gender equity ; and ( d ) increasing the productivity of the poor , partly through investments in basic health and education .  
Participants emphasized the importance of traditional and local knowledge and practices to deal with climate variability , and the fact that understanding these and promoting them at the grassroots level constituted an important component in enhancing the adaptive capacity of LDCs to the adverse effects of climate change . 
Recognizing that , national and international actions are required to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in order to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and to improve the living conditions of men , women and children of all nations [ at the , economic , social , cultural , civil , and political level ] ,  
In the agreed conclusions , the Commission noted that full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social , including the right to development which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated is of crucial importance in preventing further spread of HIV / AIDS . The Commission noted that the highest level of political commitment to the empowerment and advancement of women and to the prevention , research , care and treatment of sexually transmitted infections , especially HIV / AIDS , must be secured .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
While the need for effective forward planning of purchases was recognized , it was decided that the fluid nature of many of the projects , which evolve as research progresses , makes concrete planning of purchases on a universal level extremely difficult .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
The President also informed members that , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , entities of the United Nations system , including programmes , funds , specialized agencies and regional commissions , with specific expertise in the subject matter of the special session , might make statements in the debate in plenary , provided that they were represented at the highest level .  
By adopting the recommendation of the Commission on Human Settlements acting as the preparatory committee , the General Assembly decided that the last two speaking slots at each plenary meeting , with the exception of the first and last plenary meetings , would be reserved for participants other than Member States , the Holy See , Switzerland and Palestine , provided that were represented at the highest level .  
These include the allocation of revenues from taxes collected in Kosovo to minority communities through the community committees at the municipal level ; the implementation of employment-generating projects in these communities ; improved public services and utilities ; the integration of the 24 local community offices as part of the local administration structure to ensure equal access to public services ; and provision of more educational and health facilities as well as social welfare benefits .  
In 1997 , as part of my programme for reform , I established a structure of four executive committees at the Under-Secretary-General level to act as internal decision-making mechanisms for the five main areas of concern : peace and security ; economic and social affairs ; development cooperation ; humanitarian affairs ; and human rights as a cross-cutting theme .  
Successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action will require , at the national level among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The LDCs are acutely vulnerable to a variety of natural shocks , including natural disasters , and severe structural handicaps , and are susceptible to global environmental phenomena such as the loss of biological diversity and adverse effects of climate change which inter alia exacerbates drought , desertification and sea level rise .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
The sixth and most important step , which will have an immediate , positive impact , is to direct greater investment and efforts towards increasing societal awareness of HIV / AIDS , and to create an international sense of responsibility at the individual level , with greater emphasis on decent behaviour and adherence to moral values and virtues .  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
The PBC had also expressed concern at the negative growth in the operational budget and the reduction of major programmes C and D . Those issues were related : the main reason for the reduction of major programmes C and D was the lower level of technical cooperation delivery expected during 2002-2003 . 
On the other hand , a high degree of consistency at the personal level is evident : individuals who have a more positive view of the quality of the visual and sound information available to them also feel less burdened by remote working conditions , and vice versa .  
After the second experiment , it is evident that , so long as maintaining an acceptable level of quality of service in a new working mode requires additional physical and psychological effort , typical individual workloads expected during on-site work would need to be reduced if remote interpretation were to be used . 
Bearing in mind that corruption and the close social , economic and political links existing between employers of bonded labour and government officials at local level may be responsible for the perpetuation of this abhorrent practice ,  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
However , even the poorest country is bound to ensure the highest level their resources will permit and , at the very least , a basic minimum level of economic , social and cultural rights . 20 The concept of progressive realization can not be used to justify persistent injustice and inequality . 
The consumption of food in sufficient quantity and adequate quality to ensure adequate growth of babies and children , as well as women , elderly and other vulnerable groups , must be monitored at the local level ( communities , municipalities , districts and so on ) by the health and social welfare authorities ;  
The Ministers stressed the continuing need for international community assistance towards the stabilization of the region in peace and security as well as towards the strengthening of democratic institutions , market economies and adequate social protection structures aimed at preventing or overcoming situations of poverty and the attendant evils of despair , crime and overall citizens insecurity which may in turn foster tensions and conflicts at both the national and the international level .  
Having examined draft guideline 2.1.4 ( Absence of consequences at the international level of the violation of internal rules regarding the formulation of reservations ) , [ 8 ] the Special Rapporteur wondered whether article 46 of the Vienna Conventions on defective ratification , which was a pragmatic and balanced provision , should be transposed to reservations and interpretative declarations .  
The Government considers the success of cooperative development is fully dependent on the ability of cooperatives to overcome difficulties , including : the power of local monopolies ; unpredictable legal , administrative , customs and taxation rules ; lack of professionalism in economic and administrative control ; low level of business discipline ; and corruption .  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
Based on experience to date , the current funding level of the operational reserve , targeted at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year , appears sufficient to meet the requirements originally included in the definition of the operational reserve .  
While the share of the national recurrent budget allocated to the health sector has been maintained , on average , at the same level , a lower proportion of the health budget is spent on provincial health services where the majority of the population live .  
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
Support for the process of decentralization and devolution of environmental management takes various forms : strengthening of executive branch institutions involved in the process , and empowerment of local governments , as the main management bodies at the local level , as well as the actual communities to take over ongoing management of their natural resources .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
At the multilateral level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : a continued and enhanced coordination between the work programmes of the international organizations concerned , such as the CBT , WIPO , WHO and UNCTAD ; and exploitation of minimum standards of an international sui generis system for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
It was necessary to promote a broad legal framework that combined adequate recognition of customary law with other instruments of modern law , as well as its adequate protection at the international level .  
In its General Comment No . 5 ( 1994 ) on disability , the Committee defined the rights of persons with disabilities and made explicit reference to their right to physical and mental health , which implied the right to have access to , and to benefit from , those medical and social services that would enable them to sustain and reach their optimum level of independence and functioning .  
Quoting rule 4 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities , 4 the Committee stated that , in addition to the need to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to adequate food , accessible housing and other basic material needs , it was also necessary to ensure that support services , including assisting devices were available for persons with disabilities , so as to assist them in increasing their level of independence in their daily life and in exercising their rights .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The representative of Benin stated that a project to adopt a competition law in his country had been stopped when the West African Economic and Monetary Union , of which Benin was a member , decided on the adoption of a common competition regulation that would supersede competition laws at the national level .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Finally , in cooperation with OHCHR , UNEP is organizing a seminar on environment and human rights to discuss interlinkages , common protection approaches , the special role played by some groups and their vulnerability , and proposals for future courses of action at the national and international level .  
At the national level , the Service Centre for Human Rights Education , established in 1997 , continues to provide systematic assistance and advice to school teachers on human rights issues , including the development of special projects and of a newsletter .  Anti-racism educational efforts were also reported .  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
Position required to address deficiencies in the level of resources dedicated to the Asia and Middle East region : provides support for the chief on financial management of peacekeeping offices in the Asia and Middle East region , actions day-to-day correspondence , monitors status of allotments reports , assists unit with general administrative and clerical functions , responsible for coordinating unit reporting exercises and compilation of information ( IMIS ) for analysis by the chief .  
Once the revised budgets for missions in transition ( UNMEE , UNAMSIL , MONUC and UNIFIL ) and for the support account for peacekeeping operations , with the proposed resource requirements resulting from the comprehensive review and capacity study , have been considered by the General Assembly , budget levels are projected to increase over the initial current level of $ 1.7-billion to some slightly in excess of $ 3.0-billion for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 .  
Bearing in mind also that both the legislative and oversight organs of the Organization have stressed the importance of having in place an effective monitoring mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the delegated authority for the management of human resources in peacekeeping operations , it is proposed to strengthen Cluster VI by two additional Professional ( 1 P-5 , 1-P-4 ) and one General Service ( Other level ) posts . 
Recommends to the Commission on Human Rights that it authorize the Sub-Commission to appoint Mr . El Hadji Guiss as Special Rapporteur to conduct a detailed study on the relationship between the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights and the promotion of the realization of the right to drinking water supply and sanitation , at national and international level , taking also into account questions related to the realization of the right to development , in order to determine the most effective means of reinforcing activities in this field ;  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
Noting that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
We have the honour to inform you that at two urgent and successive meetings , the first of the Follow-up Committee of the Ninth Islamic Summit Conference and the second of the Islamic Group , both held yesterday , at the ambassadorial level , grave concern was expressed over the deteriorating situation that has developed in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem .  
Moreover , in the half-century that has elapsed since its establishment on the island of Taiwan , the Republic of China has seen significant political , economic and social development which renders it in practice an important member of the international community , as has been widely recognized at the global level .  
The Refugee Education Trust , an independent fund established in December 2000 with strong support from United Nations agencies , donors , Governments and non-governmental organizations , is a mechanism designed to provide sustainable post-primary education , motivating refugee children to continue and complete primary schooling in the hope that they may return to their communities as teachers , professionals and leaders after obtaining the necessary skills at the post-primary level . 
The unprecedented development of corporate , State and international information systems and the simultaneous expansion of opportunities of access to them have attained such a level that today practically every member of the international community will be exposed to a real risk of electronic attack by criminals or terrorists .  
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
Following meetings with government officials and humanitarian partners and field visits to Bi , Cabinda and Malanje provinces , the Executive Director expressed serious concern about the poor level of education for children and stressed the importance of expanded access and increased government resources for the social sectors .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Four distinct functional elements are delineated ( peacekeeping best practices and policy , public information , gender and peacekeeping and the Resource Centre ) , for which 19 new posts are requested ( 13 Professional and 6 General Service ( Other level ) ) , in addition to the current staffing of 8 .  
The public expenditure level set under the national budget must ensure that the social and economic sectors are adequately financed , taking into account the absorptive and fiscal capacity of the economy over the medium term .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
The options for determining the level and timing of emissions reductions and limitations include international agreement on emissions and / or concentration levels and on how the effort will be equitably shared , programmes for technological development , national policies to affect the energy mix and associated investments , market-based and regulatory policy instruments , and voluntary action .  
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
From this perspective and in the light of the international momentum towards achieving universal accession to the Agencys safeguards regime , we are amazed at the position of certain countries that are active and influential in the field of non-proliferation , which occasionally adopt a negative attitude towards the need to attain universal accession to the safeguards system .  This clear contradiction demonstrates the lack of credibility of certain influential countries in dealing seriously with the countries that fail to comply with the principles now enshrined at the international level .  
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .  
The various measures agreed on , particularly the creation at the national , regional and international levels of strategies and plans of action , required widespread support to the countries involved in the struggle as well as the promotion at the international level of legal cooperation and strengthening of cross-border controls .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
The new format , which was intended to reflect an approach that was more qualitative than quantitative , set forth the objectives around which each programme had been designed , as well as expected accomplishments , indicators of achievement and external factors that could affect the level of success in meeting those expectations .  
For this reason , we are not bound by such wording and concepts contained in that document which , therefore , shall not entail any political or legal consequences and do not oblige us to take any preventive , legislative , judicial , administrative , regulatory or other measures at the national level .  
As reflected in table 1 below , the projected overall level of expenditures is currently expected to amount to $ 78.6-million , representing additional requirements in the amount of $ 975,700 over the provision approved to date for the additional activities , such as the extensive data cleaning and verification essential for the implementation of the payroll module , which were not fully foreseen . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to seek views of Member States on the desirability of convening a high-level policy consultation at the governmental level with a view to setting priorities and developing critical strategies that would meet the manifold challenges faced by rural women ;  
Her delegation remained committed to participation in the special session at the highest political level , and to childrens participation in the planned local , national and international events , which would enhance the visibility of the session .  
Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance , including both humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Among the recommendations of the Secretary-General was the strengthening of the mandate of BONUCA in order to enhance its effectiveness and the visibility of its activities by increasing its resource capabilities , strengthening its administrative capacities and making available to the Office a level of resources commensurate with its revised mandate , namely , bringing about political dialogue and national reconciliation , monitoring the security situation , ensuring respect for and the promotion of human rights ; and providing political support for the mobilization of resources with a view to the economic reconstruction of the country .  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
For the first time in my countrys history , free and direct elections were held for the presidency of the Republic and at the local level to ensure administrative decentralization and to safeguard the common partnership of the people in assuming the burdens of comprehensive development .  
To this end , we have been including the subject of civic education in primary and secondary school curricula , and we have been developing large-scale civic campaigns to provide education at the national level about democratic values .  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;

Recognizes the importance of the adoption of appropriate policy responses to the challenges of globalization at the national level , in particular by pursuing sound and stable domestic policies , including sound macroeconomic and social policies , inter alia , those contributing to increased income of the poor , in order to realize the objective of the eradication of poverty ;  
Paragraph 26.9 stated that the level of resource requirements did not include any provision for the information activities associated with special meetings and conferences to be scheduled for the biennium 2002-2003 and that , should the Department of Public Information be required to carry out promotional and informational activities specific to those meetings and conferences , the necessary requirements would be sought through the presentation of statements of programme budget implications .  
To develop local , national and regional capacities through a lasting strategic alliance among all development actors so that advantage can be taken at the local level of the potential of globalization through an exchange of experiences and best practices within and between countries , the promotion of formal and informal education for national and local leaders , and support for applied research and technological innovation at all levels .  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
Recognizing the need to harness synergies and to create cooperation among the various Information and Communication Technologies initiatives , at the regional and global level , currently being undertaken or planned to promote and foster the potential of Information and Communication Technologies for development by other international organizations and civil society ,  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;
