After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
He further stated that cultural organizations specific to an ethnic group were permissible , but political parties based on ethnicity were not legal since membership would necessarily be discriminatory .  
Many formal sector firms , private and public , have grown accustomed to protected markets , discriminatory administrative procedures and controlled banking practices , and have problems adjusting to free markets .  
Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
Members requested detailed statistical data in the subsequent report and asked whether the current legislation was not discriminatory in that it made a distinction between female prostitutes and their male clients .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Their recommendations are largely general rather than focused on specific rights : it has generally been felt necessary and urgent to call for the respect of the non-discrimination principle , the conformity of national legislation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , accession to international human rights instruments , the elimination of discriminatory practices and the abrogation of laws that discriminate against women . 
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
Throughout their entire life cycle , women 's daily existence and long-term aspirations are restricted by discriminatory attitudes , unjust social and economic structures , and a lack of resources in most countries that prevent their full and equal participation .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights .

Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
Her country had endeavoured to solve the social and economic problems of Crimea , adopting measures which could not be considered discriminatory , since they were compatible with international law and with internationally recognized principles of human rights .  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
The Government of Mexico , given the incidents in Riverside County , California , in March and April 1996 when Mexican nationals were beaten and some lost their lives , has expressed its indignation to its United States counterpart and forcefully condemned violations of its nationals ' human rights , stating that the clear abuse of authority displayed in those incidents confirms the urgent need for determined action to stamp out discriminatory attitudes which spill over into acts of institutional violence .  
Numerous administrative circulars in the public and semi _ public services and authorities lay down discriminatory treatment for the immigrant population , among them ANPE ( the National Employment Agency ) , ASSEDIC ( Family Allowance funds ) and the Social Security Offices , which are required to carry out special checks and to demand supporting documents and even systematically to inform on immigrants to a specialized department in the prefectures .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to revoke all discriminatory legislation and to apply all other legislation without discrimination against any ethnic , national , religious or linguistic group , to ensure the speedy and consistent investigation of acts of discrimination and violence against refugees and internally displaced persons , and to ensure the arrest and punishment of those responsible for acts of discrimination and violence ;  
Immigrants are often the victims of verbal abuse and physical violence on the part of militants from ultra _ rightist parties and extremist and xenophobic organizations , as well as of growing institutional racism , discriminatory legislation and harsh police repression . 
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary , secondary and tertiary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , remedying the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and creating an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect . 
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
The inherent nature of the colonial undertaking , the exploitative , discriminatory and dominating character of its philosophy as a system , the methods employed and the final results it had on very dissimilar societies mark the difference .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
HTPs include female genital mutilation , early marriage and the attendant harmful consequences of early pregnancies , widowhood practices , discriminatory inheritance and property laws , bride price , betrothal rights , parental consent , discriminatory divorce laws , lack of contractual capacity , wife battering , male child preference , and unequal access to education and health care .  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
Although my delegation also shares the objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the need to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world , we remain unconvinced of the utility of an exercise bound by the flawed and discriminatory approaches of the NPT .  
The Working Group is deeply concerned about the continuing de facto discriminatory treatment of certain social groups , including women , reflected by limitations on their full participation in public life , educational choices and employment opportunities and by alleged child slavery and prostitution .  
HTPs include female genital mutilation , early marriage and the attendant pregnancies which cause Vesico Vagina Fistula ( VVF ) , widowhood practices , discriminatory inheritance and property laws , bride price , betrothal rights , parental consent , discriminatory divorce laws , lack of contractual capacity , wife battering , male child preference , and unequal access to education and health care .  
The five _ year criminal record requirement in the Czech citizenship law , inadequate efforts to publicize the possibility of a waiver , as well as discriminatory and inconsistent application of the law ' s provisions , have deprived thousands of Roma previously resident in the Czech Republic of citizenship and its attendant benefits _ holding government office , voting , obtaining social benefits _ and have exposed them to a criminal sentence of expulsion upon conviction of a crime .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary and secondary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , to remedy the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and to create an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation the affirmative action that might have been adopted to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and it is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Ad hoc regimes , acting under the pretext of nonproliferation , continued to pursue discriminatory policies with the main objective of exclusive possession of nuclear technology by developed countries .  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
In addition , the Declaration prohibits individual or collective expulsion on discriminatory grounds ( art . 7 ) and provides for trade union rights , the right to safe and healthy working conditions and the right to medical care , social security , and education ( art .  8 ) .  
Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen and update international legislation against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including by drawing up an international code of ethics for communications media , especially the Internet , that includes specific measures to combat the unlawful dissemination of information that is racist , discriminatory , xenophobic or relating to intolerance ;  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
There is no reason to believe that the relevant CFA judgement is not consistent with the true legislative intent .  We also accept the CFA ruling which holds that the arrangement under the existing legislation that only persons born outside Hong Kong of female Hong Kong permanent residents are eligible for ROA is discriminatory and inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
He further stated that cultural organizations specific to an ethnic group were permissible , but political parties based on ethnicity were not legal since membership would necessarily be discriminatory .  
Many formal sector firms , private and public , have grown accustomed to protected markets , discriminatory administrative procedures and controlled banking practices , and have problems adjusting to free markets .  
Any discriminatory trading practice , any imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic laws hampers this process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the standards of international law and the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
Meanwhile the Greek Cypriots living in the occupied territory ( whose numbers had dropped from 22,000 in 1974 to less than 550 in 1994 ) continued to be the victims of discriminatory measures , harassment and violent acts and to suffer human rights violations ( 1,619 Greek Cypriots had disappeared ) and systematic looting of the cultural heritage of Cyprus .  
Members requested detailed statistical data in the subsequent report and asked whether the current legislation was not discriminatory in that it made a distinction between female prostitutes and their male clients .  
In her answer to the question concerning measures taken by her Government to ensure that the level of women 's representation in public life did not decline , particularly in rural areas , the representative said that legislation in the Russian Federation contained no discriminatory rules limiting the participation of women in the political life of the country .  
Complete national law reviews by 2000 in order to incorporate the principles and provisions of accepted international norms and standards into national legislation and to revoke any remaining discriminatory laws ; ( d ) Provide gender sensitivity and women 's human rights training for all public officials , including law enforcement officers , legal and medical personnel , members of parliament and social workers , so that they may better exercise their public responsibilities ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Their recommendations are largely general rather than focused on specific rights : it has generally been felt necessary and urgent to call for the respect of the non-discrimination principle , the conformity of national legislation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , accession to international human rights instruments , the elimination of discriminatory practices and the abrogation of laws that discriminate against women . 
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
Throughout their entire life cycle , women 's daily existence and long-term aspirations are restricted by discriminatory attitudes , unjust social and economic structures , and a lack of resources in most countries that prevent their full and equal participation .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
The specific , defining feature of coercive economic measures is that of negative economic activities applied for political purposes , forming part of discriminatory or punitive interventionist policies .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
addition to ratification , however , there was a need for more decisive action at the national and international level , at a time when certain ultra-conservative and racist groups were seeking to impose discriminatory legislation that denied access to basic educational and health services to children of immigrants , in flagrant violation of their most basic human rights .

Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Any discriminatory trade practice , imposition of unilateral economic measures or extraterritorial application of domestic law obstructs that process and is unacceptable and incompatible with the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
In spite of the continued existence of certain discriminatory attitudes linked to negative aspects of the traditional culture , women in Burundi benefited from a legal framework enabling them to reach their potential in society , notwithstanding the state of war which still paralysed the country .  Burundian women 's associations had done much to promote the emancipation of women .  
Her country had endeavoured to solve the social and economic problems of Crimea , adopting measures which could not be considered discriminatory , since they were compatible with international law and with internationally recognized principles of human rights .  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
It was regrettable that , instead of striving to halt the widespread gross violations of human rights in their own societies and rectifying their racist and discriminatory attitudes towards nationals of other countries residing in their territories , certain States arrogated to themselves the role of universal guardians and preachers of human rights , levelling unsubstantiated accusations against other countries on a purely selective basis .  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
All countries should increase their mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field , eliminate unequal practices in trade and economic relations , and do away with discriminatory policies with a view to gradually narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity .  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
The Committee remains concerned at prevailing traditional attitudes and harmful practices , such as female genital mutilation , early marriages and teenage pregnancies , and at the persistence of discriminatory social attitudes against vulnerable groups of children , such as the girl child , disabled children , children born out of wedlock and children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans .  
Accusations contained in this paragraph , concerning alleged discriminatory laws , are inaccurate , never having been articulated in this manner by any international body dealing with the Yugoslav legal system - either CERD or the many special rapporteurs of the Commission .  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
Moreover , the Register must be expanded to include nuclear weapons and sophisticated technology with military applications if it is to become a more balanced instrument , free of all discriminatory criteria , and to have a more global scope and the highest possible number of participants .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
The Government of Mexico , given the incidents in Riverside County , California , in March and April 1996 when Mexican nationals were beaten and some lost their lives , has expressed its indignation to its United States counterpart and forcefully condemned violations of its nationals ' human rights , stating that the clear abuse of authority displayed in those incidents confirms the urgent need for determined action to stamp out discriminatory attitudes which spill over into acts of institutional violence .  
Numerous administrative circulars in the public and semi _ public services and authorities lay down discriminatory treatment for the immigrant population , among them ANPE ( the National Employment Agency ) , ASSEDIC ( Family Allowance funds ) and the Social Security Offices , which are required to carry out special checks and to demand supporting documents and even systematically to inform on immigrants to a specialized department in the prefectures .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to revoke all discriminatory legislation and to apply all other legislation without discrimination against any ethnic , national , religious or linguistic group , to ensure the speedy and consistent investigation of acts of discrimination and violence against refugees and internally displaced persons , and to ensure the arrest and punishment of those responsible for acts of discrimination and violence ;  
Immigrants are often the victims of verbal abuse and physical violence on the part of militants from ultra _ rightist parties and extremist and xenophobic organizations , as well as of growing institutional racism , discriminatory legislation and harsh police repression . 
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary , secondary and tertiary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , remedying the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and creating an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between women and men within article 4 , paragraph 1 , of the Convention so as to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and there is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect . 
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
The inherent nature of the colonial undertaking , the exploitative , discriminatory and dominating character of its philosophy as a system , the methods employed and the final results it had on very dissimilar societies mark the difference .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
The above law is applicable both to the public and private sectors , and , apart from defining the concept of indirect discrimination , it establishes that discriminatory practices occur when there is a considerable disproportion between the number of male and female workers .  
HTPs include female genital mutilation , early marriage and the attendant harmful consequences of early pregnancies , widowhood practices , discriminatory inheritance and property laws , bride price , betrothal rights , parental consent , discriminatory divorce laws , lack of contractual capacity , wife battering , male child preference , and unequal access to education and health care .  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
Although my delegation also shares the objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the need to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world , we remain unconvinced of the utility of an exercise bound by the flawed and discriminatory approaches of the NPT .  
The Working Group is deeply concerned about the continuing de facto discriminatory treatment of certain social groups , including women , reflected by limitations on their full participation in public life , educational choices and employment opportunities and by alleged child slavery and prostitution .  
HTPs include female genital mutilation , early marriage and the attendant pregnancies which cause Vesico Vagina Fistula ( VVF ) , widowhood practices , discriminatory inheritance and property laws , bride price , betrothal rights , parental consent , discriminatory divorce laws , lack of contractual capacity , wife battering , male child preference , and unequal access to education and health care .  
The five _ year criminal record requirement in the Czech citizenship law , inadequate efforts to publicize the possibility of a waiver , as well as discriminatory and inconsistent application of the law ' s provisions , have deprived thousands of Roma previously resident in the Czech Republic of citizenship and its attendant benefits _ holding government office , voting , obtaining social benefits _ and have exposed them to a criminal sentence of expulsion upon conviction of a crime .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary and secondary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , to remedy the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and to create an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The Committee notes that despite the efforts made it has not proved possible to incorporate in legislation the affirmative action that might have been adopted to ensure womens political participation , under the Constitution , because it is seen as discriminatory and it is clearly resistance on the part of legislative , executive and judicial bodies to their being put into effect .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Ad hoc regimes , acting under the pretext of nonproliferation , continued to pursue discriminatory policies with the main objective of exclusive possession of nuclear technology by developed countries .  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
An international observatory should be established to monitor racially discriminatory attitudes and acts , individual or collective , private or public , including by non-State actors , charged with the following tasks :  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
In addition , the Declaration prohibits individual or collective expulsion on discriminatory grounds ( art . 7 ) and provides for trade union rights , the right to safe and healthy working conditions and the right to medical care , social security , and education ( art .  8 ) .  
Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen and update international legislation against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including by drawing up an international code of ethics for communications media , especially the Internet , that includes specific measures to combat the unlawful dissemination of information that is racist , discriminatory , xenophobic or relating to intolerance ;  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the supreme chief of the Taliban , asking him not to issue the decree because of its discriminatory nature and stressing that measures designed to protect minorities must be consistent with the relevant international human rights standards , which were based on the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of religion or belief .
