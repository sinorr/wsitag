However as I said earlier , the HKMA may , in certain cases , complete the vetting and approval process of senior management changes in banks within a few days .  The time required in the case of BOC Hong Kong 's chief executive post was about the same as that required in similar cases .  
During the eight-day intensive meetings in Hong Kong , members of the SARS Expert Committee examined the management of the SARS epidemic to establish the relevant facts .

Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
Chen Chien-an , an architectural worker and one of that first generation of children to be inspired by Chang Shih-tsung , recalls : " Many little children at that time were influenced by him . For them studying was not boring and unprofitable , and they could always learn contentedly . " At senior high school Chen once won first prize in the school science exhibition , applying a principle learned from the " nine joined rings . "  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings . I have just been trying to play a fair , objective , and occasionally humorous role , to balance and mediate the confrontational situation between the supplementary legislators and the senior legislators , in order to keep the agenda moving smoothly .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
Stalin , who massacred the intellectuals , paid special attention to genetics , psychology , applied mathematics and computers , which he saw as products of capitalism , and on the basis of pseudoscientific theories he ordered the schools to suspend any relevant teaching . " At that time a deadly atmosphere hung over academic circles , " says Karapetjants Artemi , a senior collaborator in Chinese languages .  
Before 1973 the primary and secondary students began classes at the same time . Now that the parents have been through grades 1-12 under the same roof , the elementary and junior / senior high schoolers have separate daily flag ceremonies , with the national anthem resounding four times .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
Because the two main characters of Pushing Hands were played by two very experienced senior actors and this was the first time Lee was directing , he was " shy of stepping on their toes and was n't comfortable telling them what to do . "  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school .

Peng Yung-kuan says that the people who are really in pressing need of daycare are disabled and infirm old people who need personal care , and not the people that daycare services are currently geared towards : mobile , healthy senior citizens who are capable of taking care of themselves .  
Even if there are numerous homes and senior citizen centers that have been set up by government agencies and private organizations which can solve the problems of part of the elderly population , many of these places do not accept people who are indigent , too sick or aged , entirely unable to care for themselves , or who have been abandoned by their families . Most of the elderly at home alone are n't served by the homes and senior citizen centers .  
Given that everyone is exposed to the mass media today , it is hard to ensure that the views and statements that senior citizens express about the past have not been guided by the current context . " It is very possible that , given a certain atmosphere in society , the interviewee knows very well what the interviewer is aiming at , and just tells him or her what they want to hear , " cautions Wang Ming-ko , an associate researcher at the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .  
In the context of such an impressive and long-lasting buxiban culture , the Committee of Taipei Historical Records held a seminar in September of last year on " Examination-Oriented Supplementary Schools in Retrospect . " They invited a wide number of Taipei City 's senior pedagogues , such as the prestigious 1970s buxiban teachers Hsu Chen-liang and Chang Chin-wen , affirming the decades of educational work they contributed and expressing the hope that one day , when exemplary teachers are listed on Teachers ' Day , buxiban teachers will have a place too .  
Also different from the past , many of these successful teachers of the buxiban world have been cultivated by the buxibans . " They are nurtured along like movie stars , " says senior teacher Tseng Cheng-ping . For this reason , they should be young , vivacious and also attractive-most men are handsome and debonair , most ladies pretty and extrovert . To put it another way , besides being able to teach well , other exterior requirements for " packaging " are also important .  
All through school-elementary , junior high , senior high , and into college-we have all faced this kind of test . Items like counting how many blocks are in a pile , folding a flat piece of paper into a box , mirroring or splitting a drawing , mathematical calculations and logical deduction tests , analogies and grouping of words are all commonly seen on intelligence and aptitude tests .  
At the same time , new standardized physical fitness tests have been announced for all of Taiwan 's elementary schools and junior and senior high schools . So balanced education is no longer just a distant ideal . It has become a trend of the times .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO . " From long-term observations of the Satellite Project , it can be seen that poor communication prior to several important policy decisions , as well as a lack of concrete explanations and figures during policy shifts , is at the crux of many unnecessary disputes . "  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .

And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
Several senior members of the media expressed the opinion that while the new Internet-based media have remarkable potential , the old medium of the newspaper will not be swept away , and instead will be improved by intense competition .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan .

They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China . " It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
For example , one mother had very high educational ideals and understood how to stimulate her child 's potential . Their family did n't watch TV , and she often took her son to music concerts . After he graduated from junior high , her son applied and was admitted to Taipei 's top senior high school , Chienkuo , and then tested into prestigious National Taiwan University ( NTU ) .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing .

During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
George Newstrom , who is corporate senior vice-president at EDS and chairman-elect of the World Information Services Technology Alliance , spoke on the theme " Preventing the Technological Eclipse of Humanity . " He expressed his concerns about the current creation of " technology for its own sake . " While conceding that technology is a wonderful thing , Newstrom said that the question is : " Can we grow up and learn fast enough to handle the awesome power and potential that technology offers ? "  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic . A friend introduced Huang junior to replacement-meal " shakes , " and in a month he lost 12 kilos . After this , Huang Pin-hung himself began drinking the liquid meals , accompanied by a regime of light , mildly spiced foods and jogging , and he too reduced his weight from 76 to 66 kilos .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
" My eldest brother was beaten more than any of us when he was little , but now he is the most devoted , " notes a senior newspaper reporter , who is one of three siblings .

Even when she or her younger brother did something wrong , their parents still punished her older brother for not teaching his younger siblings to behave correctly .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
In her first and second years in university she tried to transfer to the department of foreign languages . In her senior year she began taking courses at a supplementary school to prepare for the exam to enter graduate school to study foreign relations . Although she was thwarted in each of these three attempts to advance toward her dream , she is still working hard now to save money to go abroad to approach it from a fresh angle .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
Weng Ya-lan , a graduate of National Taipei Teachers ' College , says that this is the third year she has been sitting exams . She had been working all along as a substitute teacher in Taipei County . If not successful this time , she had planned to study for the junior and senior civil service exams and become a civil servant .

He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .

' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
These private art museums or memorial museums on the one hand afford centralized management and exhibition of these senior artists ' works , and privately held works of art might be donated to foundations as public cultural assets open to the public . In another sense , they bring greater diversity to art appreciation , spreading and expanding viewing opportunities beyond the select few major public art museums .  
Public facilities in the village are first-rate , including three primary schools , a junior high school , a senior high school , an employee day care center , an employee discount store , traditional fruit and vegetable markets , restaurants , athletic fields , a golf driving range , a public swimming pool , a library , a cinema , a hospital , and even a funeral home .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
Several senior members of the media expressed the opinion that while the new Internet-based media have remarkable potential , the old medium of the newspaper will not be swept away , and instead will be improved by intense competition .  
To make matters worse , the government has also been downsizing . The result is that virtually everyone-whether from large multinational firms or small enterprises , white-collar or blue-collar workers , senior specialists or low skilled laborers , from private firms or from the civil service ( long reputed to be the safest of careers ) - now lives under the shadow of an unexpected change in career path .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China . " It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
Today 's senior citizens laid the foundation upon which Taiwan 's current success was built , but they 've been abandoned in these rural communities . We , their juniors , are an ungrateful generation . Q : Do you feel that transplanting the elderly to the city is a better solution ?  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
For example , one mother had very high educational ideals and understood how to stimulate her child 's potential . Their family did n't watch TV , and she often took her son to music concerts . After he graduated from junior high , her son applied and was admitted to Taipei 's top senior high school , Chienkuo , and then tested into prestigious National Taiwan University ( NTU ) .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
George Newstrom , who is corporate senior vice-president at EDS and chairman-elect of the World Information Services Technology Alliance , spoke on the theme " Preventing the Technological Eclipse of Humanity . " He expressed his concerns about the current creation of " technology for its own sake . " While conceding that technology is a wonderful thing , Newstrom said that the question is : " Can we grow up and learn fast enough to handle the awesome power and potential that technology offers ? "  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
With so much learning and understanding of many areas incorporated into his very existence , Lai passed the exam to become a court clerk while still in his third year at school , then passed the bar exam in his fourth year . In his fifth year he surpassed himself , passing the exam to become a judge , the exam to enter the Graduate Institute of Law at National Taiwan University , and the special exam on tax law , thereby entering the civil service at a senior level .  
This sinologist from afar believes that his destiny has always been connected to China . Indeed , Joppert , who has always shown an outstanding intellect ever since early youth and has a sharp sixth sense , believes that 900 years ago he was a senior minister in the court of Huizong . The latter two characters of his Chinese name , Li Jiade , are identical with the name of the Song emperor Huizong 's main palace : Jiade Palace . Is that a coincidence , or fate ?  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic . A friend introduced Huang junior to replacement-meal " shakes , " and in a month he lost 12 kilos . After this , Huang Pin-hung himself began drinking the liquid meals , accompanied by a regime of light , mildly spiced foods and jogging , and he too reduced his weight from 76 to 66 kilos .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
" My eldest brother was beaten more than any of us when he was little , but now he is the most devoted , " notes a senior newspaper reporter , who is one of three siblings . When they were young , their father hit her older brother or forced him to kneel in punishment on a daily basis . Even when she or her younger brother did something wrong , their parents still punished her older brother for not teaching his younger siblings to behave correctly .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
In her first and second years in university she tried to transfer to the department of foreign languages . In her senior year she began taking courses at a supplementary school to prepare for the exam to enter graduate school to study foreign relations . Although she was thwarted in each of these three attempts to advance toward her dream , she is still working hard now to save money to go abroad to approach it from a fresh angle .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
Weng Ya-lan , a graduate of National Taipei Teachers ' College , says that this is the third year she has been sitting exams . She had been working all along as a substitute teacher in Taipei County . If not successful this time , she had planned to study for the junior and senior civil service exams and become a civil servant .

Each of these from the most powerful to the least , from the leaders of Mozambique 's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside , from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished .  
The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .
