Public security Minister Jia Chunwang pointed out at a news briefing held today : The public security organs at all levels must adhere to the guiding principle of taking the initiative to grasp problems in real earnest and on an earlier date and should firmly keep the initiative in work .  Grasping problems in real earnest does not mean staging a show for the leaders and masses .  Rather , it means daring to crack hard nuts in real earnest ;  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .

The probation period is one year .

The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .

The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
At an earlier time , the authorities also issued a directive , urging the public to come forward and inform against lawbreakers .

The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
A source revealed : In accordance with the spirit of a central work meeting held in Beidaihe , the State Council has decided to introduce a series of new policies and measures aimed at stimulating domestic demand , including increasing personal consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars , and speeding up input in infrastructure projects , and to urge the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] to approve on an earlier date , the issuance of 50-billion yuan of national bonds as well .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .

Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
The two sides held that an earlier solution to the Afghanistan issue was in the interest of regional security and stability and stressed the need to seek a political settlement through negotiation between the parties concerned and establish a broad - based government representing all factions and ethnic groups .

With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .

Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , had a modest growth of 3.9% in real terms in the first quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , after a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2002 . 
This latest revision , along with the lifting of the Hong Kong travel advisory earlier by both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , send a strong signal that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is contained in Hong Kong , travel is safe , and Hong Kong will continue to protect public health .  
( b ) The HKMA must not disclose information of individuals or individual authorized institutions obtained by it in the discharge of its supervisory functions .  However as I said earlier , the HKMA may , in certain cases , complete the vetting and approval process of senior management changes in banks within a few days .  The time required in the case of BOC Hong Kong 's chief executive post was about the same as that required in similar cases .  
The SARS Expert Committee , comprising 11 international , mainland and local experts , was appointed by the Chief Executive on May 28 , 2003 to carry out a comprehensive and expert study into the SARS outbreak earlier in Hong Kong , and to make recommendations on areas of improvement so that Hong Kong 's public health system could be better prepared in the future for a possible return of SARS or other infectious diseases .  
Overall investment spending , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation ( GDFCF ) , fell back by 5.3% in real terms in the second quarter of 2003 over a year earlier , following a 3.5% rise in the first quarter . 
The forecast rate of change in real terms in overall investment spending in the economy in 2003 , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is broadly unchanged at - 5.4% , as against - 5.5% put out earlier . 
Under the risk-based supervisory approach mentioned earlier , the objective of a comprehensive on-site examination is to review whether the risk management systems in place are effective and adequate to identify , measure , monitor and control the various risks commonly associated with an authorized institution , namely , credit , interest rate , market , liquidity , operational , legal , reputation , and strategic .  
But perhaps one of Ta An 's greatest attractions is a throwback to its earlier history - - the trees and grass that adorn its broader boulevards such as the elegant Jenai Road . Here , the dense foliage , chirping birds and silver spray of fountains can easily make one forget one is in the middle of a bustling commercial district .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
While the intricate and exquisite works of dynastic China can be appreciated for their sheer beauty , the new collectors of folk art felt a special bond of affection for these representative pieces of an earlier , simpler time .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell . He rushed home , but only to realize that his wife had already sold the remaining ticket earlier in the evening . Every term , one winning number is chosen .  
In earlier days , the majority of schools and athletic centers in the ROC surfaced their tracks and baseball diamonds with either crushed brick or cinder . In fair weather the air was filled with dust and grit and when it rained the surfaces were pocked with puddles , causing numerous headaches and much inconvenience for their users .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
Now , the first thing we discovered wa s that that was nonsense . [ pointing at the MP speaking on the monitor ] Now he is absolutely stable , his arm is on the dispatch box and he is absolutely stuck there , If you watched the Prime Minister earlier this afternoon , however , he will lean forward then step back and turn around . Now you can not have a head and shoulders shot , so you have to have a bigger picture , which in itself is quite interesting .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
The main harvesting tools included stone sickles , stone knives , and stone shovels . Compared to the earlier Yangshao era , manufacture of stone implements by striking had given way to manufacture by grinding . Some of the more special items include jade axes with carefully and skilfully done animal face designs .  
But in earlier years , the Pu'er produced in Yunnan was not aged enough , its taste was n't smooth , and its grade was n't high . Most people did n't know that Pu'er , unlike the teas grown in Taiwan , does n't like to be sealed up and should from time to time be brought out and aired . Otherwise , in a hot and humid climate , it easily molds and rots , making it quite literally a " stinky , moldy tea . "  
The fine arts world at that time uncovered two homegrown artists , Hung Tung and Ju Ming , and the painting world was swept by a nostalgic " native realism " emphasizing things and people from local Taiwanese culture and society , and especially from the countryside . Representative artists included Hsieh Ming-chang , Ong Ching-tu , Chen Tung-yuan , and others like Hsi Teh-chin and Hsu Kun-cheng who had awakened to this style even earlier than the others .  
Herbs determined to be more effective woul dsimply replace the earlier ones used in the same prescription . There are more than 80,000 prescriptions listed in Chinese medicine reference books , but only several hundred are commonly used . Many of there maining exist in name only . Among the 13 prohibited ingredients in the list recently released by the Department of Health , otter liver , elephant skin , and bear gall secretion have been rarely prescribed for a long time now .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things . In recent years the problems of divorce and extramarital affairs have become increasingly serious , the schools have gone co-ed , boys and girls have manifold opportunities to meet , and there is information about sex everywhere one turns . Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
In 1997 , after the new curricula for elementary schools had been fully implemented , Chung Ching , an assistant professor of math education at National Taipei Teachers ' College wrote in a report he made on " The Transformation of the Culture of Math Class in the Lower Grades " that those students who have been educated under the new curricula are much more " able to voice their opinions , ask questions , work with others and learn from others ' way of thinking " than earlier students who had received traditional educations .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times . For instance , although chickenpox usually produces only mild symptoms , it is potentially crippling or even fatal . Old people still believe that the earlier a child gets chickenpox the better , but despite the high price of the chickenpox vaccine now imported from America , many parents are willing to have their children immunized .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Sung Ju-shan , a lecturer at Chinese Culture University , writes in her doctoral dissertation A Decade of Post-Cultural-Revolution Literature in Mainland China , " After shifting political circumstances debunked earlier values , the Red Guards who had devoted their youth to politics were faced with an urgent need to seek new meaning in life . "  
Breast cancer , for example , is likely to increase because of several risk factors : modern women start menstruation earlier , get married Based on risk factors in the environment , Chen Chien-jen estimates later , and are less likely to breast feed ; intake of animal fat is increasing ; and modern lifestyles are more stressful and erratic .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
In Zhou Chen 's Ning Qi Feeding an Ox , the brushwork of the trees and rocks is fluid and uninhibited , employing vigorous lines similar to those used in the work of Tang Yin , Qiu Ying , and even their predecessor Du Jin . The techniques in which these painters were so adept fused the artistic heritage of earlier generations , from the Tang dynasty onwards , creating a distinctive style that captured the mood of the middle Ming period .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
All visitors to Lukang inevitably go exploring . Besides the three major historic sites mentioned earlier , when you stroll through the narrow streets , even without deliberately looking , you just need to raise your head and you will frequently see exquisitely carved plafonds , decorative ceramic window frames , and vases inlayed into walls , providing a stream of delightful surprises .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
The works of Han Han are most representative of this genre and are very popular with younger readers . When he was 16 , Han Han became an overnight sensation with the publication of his novel Three Doors . Not academically inclined , he decided against attending Fudan University in Shanghai after graduating from high school . The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
Six months earlier , when the team of prospective climbers from subtropical Taiwan submitted their application , the authorities had misgivings because of the youth of the applicants . Later when they realized that the students had quite a bit of high-mountain experience and had received training for snowy regions , they gave the green light .  
The technician , responsible for recording the meteorological data , gets up at around 4:50 a.m . , and half an hour earlier in winter , because it is necessary to clean off the overnight rime that has coated the equipment , with hot water .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
but kohl emphasized that the conditions set for the economic and monetary union by the maastricht treaty should not be relaxed this is a change from his position earlier when he called for a postponement of the timetable by one or two years in view of the crisis of the european monetary system  
Kemp and China 's Minister of Education Chen Zhili renewed earlier today a memorandum of understanding on educational and training cooperation , in which senior education , professional and technical education , far distance education are decided as priority fields for bilateral cooperation  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The leaders of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs advocated the speedy holding in Moscow of the next , fourth , round of inter-Tajik talks , at which the fundamental questions of a political settlement must be discussed in a constructive spirit in accordance with the agenda for the talks agreed upon earlier by the parties .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
Reports of rape and sexual violence constituting violations of international humanitarian law continue to be received , although to a lesser extent than earlier in the conflict .  However , the international community needs to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the sexual atrocities against women , children and men do not reoccur on the scale reported in 1992 and 1993 .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

MOCHOCHOKO ( Lesotho ) said that the draft statute was a considerable improvement over the earlier draft , but needed to be further strengthened to ensure that it created a just , fair and effective international criminal institution .  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
Act No . 10 / 1994 of 19 May on urgent job promotion measures , published on 23 May 1994 , continues the public funding established earlier by Act No . 22 / 1992 of 30 July on urgent measures to promote employment and provide unemployment protection , which had established a government programme to promote hiring on indefinite contracts , with 500,000 pesetas earmarked ( sixth additional provision ) for promotion of the recruitment of women in professions in which they are under-represented .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
An amended and expanded version of this bill was enacted into United States law on 12 March 1996 , despite the international community 's rejection of it and the fact that the United States Administration had earlier opposed the bill because it was inconsistent with the obligations of the United States of America under the rules of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , and because of potential conflicts - indefensible under international law - with its allies .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
As explained in an earlier report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / C . 5 / 49 / 64 , para . 8 ) , the costs of staff representational activities and the staff-management consultative process can be identified as both direct costs against the regular budget and indirect costs in terms of the release of staff from their assigned programme duties .  
The role of the universities , equipped with scientific councils representing the teaching and research institutions and research personnel and elected under a democratic system independent of the Administration , has shown considerable improvement over the earlier situation ( regulated by Act No . 86-80 of 9 August 1986 ) .  
As emphasized earlier , in the delicate conditions prevalent in new and restored democracies , there is a need to coordinate what may otherwise be disjointed actions of non-governmental organizations not only with governmental plans , but also with assistance provided by bilateral donors and multilateral organizations . 
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
The following changes had been made to the text : the fifth preambular paragraph stressed the need for consolidating the existing bodies of international humanitarian law and the need for wide dissemination and full implementation of such law at the international level ; the wording of paragraph 4 had been brought into line with that of the fifth preambular paragraph ; and , in paragraph 5 , the reference to " preventive measures " in the earlier text had been deleted .  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
With respect to the age of recruitment into the armed forces ( art . , UNHCR , consistent with the position stated above , insists that the minimum age for either compulsory or voluntary recruitment into the armed forces should be set at 18 years , and does not agree that earlier recruitment should be acceptable with parental consent . 
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
At another level , the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its concern over the Afghan problem in the final communiqu of the ministerial meeting held at New Delhi earlier this month and expressed the need for the Afghan parties to move towards national reconciliation , in accordance with the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
We warmly commend the timely initiative taken by Canada in convening earlier this month an international meeting of countries that have committed themselves and taken national action to advance a global ban on anti-personnel landmines .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
First , while the earlier debate was characterized largely by fears of important contradictions between trade and environment policies , the post-UNCED debate has focused on exploring the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection , and has enlarged the development dimension in the discussion on most issues .  Conceptual and empirical analyses and debate have helped to set aside some of the early fears of incompatibility between trade and environment policies which could have induced inappropriate policy choices .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
Anti-dumping proceedings have been criticized on grounds of inadequate examinations as to whether imported and domestic products fall , in fact , within the same quality segment , lax determinations of causality between dumping and injury , neglect of consumer interests and the legal possibility to file new complaints whenever earlier complaints regarding the same import product have been unsuccessful . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 15 \ x { ffff } . 
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
Other activities included working jointly with the World Bank on ( a ) a revised and updated Glossary of the legal and economic terms fundamental to competition law and policy ( to be published in 1997 ) , an earlier version of which has been translated into several languages , including Russian and Spanish ; and ( b ) a Competition Manual for transition and developing countries ( to be published in 1997 ) .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic edifice by hindering economic development .  
DIOP ( Senegal ) supported the view expressed by earlier speakers that a strong , independent Prosecutor empowered to obtain information ex officio was crucial if the Court was to be effective .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
As noted earlier ( see chap.I , General legislative considerations , _ _ _ _ ) , in some legal systems belonging to the civil law tradition , the provision of public services is governed by a body of law known as administrative law , which governs a wide range of governmental functions .  
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .  For the 87 programmes that were ongoing on 1 January 1999 , the total expenditure rates are generally higher the earlier the programme started , with some exceptions .  
Given earlier experiences with international initiatives regarding African diversification , it can be expected that this approach and the preparatory phase will provide a better and more substantive base for the generation of financial and technical support , and equip the entrepreneurs in closing the connectivity gap that exists between them and the world markets .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In the five months that have elapsed , many people have registered to participate , and the Government has selected 181 of them ; dates have been set and postponed ; venues have been selected and changed ; the proposed facilitators referred to earlier have visited the country ; and three committees have been established .  However , a national debate has yet to be held , and only the Organizational Committee is in operation .  
Mr . Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
These earlier , elite , academic secondary schools ( based on the values of elitism and excellence ) and the later religious , popular schools bifurcated access to education ; schools were segregated by religion and class .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
In a climate of ethnic intolerance and total disrespect for international law , UNPROFOR earlier and the High Representative later ensured that fair , objective , tolerant radio and television as well as newspapers received adequate international support , while broadcasting licences for other stations were withdrawn , and the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) took control of transmitters when necessary .  
As a consequence , the Secretary-General submitted an updated revised budget for MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 in the amount of $ 47 , 402 , 100 gross ( $ 44 , 419 , 700 net ) ( see A 52-730 Add . 2 ) , which reflected the additional requirements for demining activities while at the same time revising downward the additional requirements for the identification process set out in his earlier report ( A 52-730 ) . 
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
In instances where the claimant only had annual records or had insufficient monthly records to perform a valid projection of revenue for the compensation periods , and these records were stated in Israeli shekels , the Panel concluded that the use of annual data from earlier years as a basis for the projection of revenue , without taking into account the level of inflation in Israel at the time , would create a distortion .  
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic structure by hindering economic development .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely , that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration of 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
Regional economic groups formed earlier are now being energized and new groups with diverse objectives such as free trade , investment cooperation , transport integration , harmonized social action or integrated resource use are being formed . 
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
Provision of basic legal , technical and tactical advice to investigators , prosecutors or other officials about the foreign implications of early investigative measures , based on the experiences of earlier cases ;  
Public security Minister Jia Chunwang pointed out at a news briefing held today : The public security organs at all levels must adhere to the guiding principle of taking the initiative to grasp problems in real earnest and on an earlier date and should firmly keep the initiative in work .  Grasping problems in real earnest does not mean staging a show for the leaders and masses .  Rather , it means daring to crack hard nuts in real earnest ;  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
This is aimed at helping party organizations further check , understand , and use cadres , discover and assist incompetent cadres , and make adjustments at an earlier stage .  Since August 1995 , Qingdao has implemented a probation system to place all newly selected and appointed leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level on probation .  The probation period is one year .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
At an earlier time , the authorities also issued a directive , urging the public to come forward and inform against lawbreakers .  Public security organs have already set up special hotlines and email boxes for tip-offs ; at the same time , they have also called on suspects to turn themselves in order to secure a lenient treatment from the police .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
With regard to the promotion of a new round of WTO talks being an important agenda for this Foreign Trade Minister meeting , we hope that this meeting will lead to widespread common understanding among APEC member regions and will send out a clear signal to the international community that APEC supports a new round of talks .  This will be helpful in achieving an earlier launch of a new round of talks .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
He briefed Jiang Zemin about Moldova 's domestic situation , and said that since the general elections earlier this year , Moldova has won the best opportune moment for the nation 's economic and social development .  The government of Moldova has determination to exert all efforts to regenerate the national economy .  
The informed person said that in a situation report submitted earlier to the State Council , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held that in the current circumstances , the macroeconomic policy has little impact on stopping the slide in exports because the root cause of the deteriorating export situation this year is the slide of the US economy , that has led to a global economic slowdown .  In China , it is unsuitable to adopt such measure as the devaluation of the renminbi to stimulate exports .  
A source revealed : In accordance with the spirit of a central work meeting held in Beidaihe , the State Council has decided to introduce a series of new policies and measures aimed at stimulating domestic demand , including increasing personal consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars , and speeding up input in infrastructure projects , and to urge the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] to approve on an earlier date , the issuance of 50-billion yuan of national bonds as well .  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
The two sides held that an earlier solution to the Afghanistan issue was in the interest of regional security and stability and stressed the need to seek a political settlement through negotiation between the parties concerned and establish a broad - based government representing all factions and ethnic groups . 
People have also noticed that all the six countries Li Peng has visited have invariably reiterated that they support the principle of One China and hope to see China 's complete reunification be realized on an earlier date .  They have also made it clear that they will develop no official relations with Taiwan . This shows that the Chinese Government 's principle of safeguarding national reunification has been recognized by the international community at large .  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
12 .  Article 23 shall be revised as : " Any exterior design for which a patent right may be granted shall not be identical with or similar to any exterior design that has , before the date of application , been publicly reported in a domestic or foreign publication or been publicly used in the country and shall not interfere with any legitimate rights obtained earlier by another person . "  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
This responsible person denied an earlier report carried by the Voice of America on 16 September , which claimed that the Chinese Government had arrested a total of 35,000 " Falungong " members over the previous four months .  He said that " this report does not tally with objective facts , and it is a highly irresponsible act to spread fabricated stories . "  
Your Excellency is also a senior diplomat .  When you were serving as president of the Organization of African Unity earlier this year , You successfully held a series of regional summit meetings and helped Eritrea and Ethiopian sign a cease-fire agreement .  You have made positive contributions to strengthening African unity and restoring regional peace , and have won wide praise of the international community .  
Zhang Quanjing pointed out that in conducting the activities of " reviewing the past , " we should lay special stress on the examination of our ideological and political level to see if it has been remarkably enhanced ; of the implementation of the central authorities ' line , principles , and policies to see if they have been carried out unrelentingly ; of the problems that have been checked out and laid bare earlier on , especially the problems that have evoked strong repercussions among the masses , to see if they have been resolved ;  
With regard to the leading groups and leading cadres who failed to distinctly enhance their ideological understanding , fully mobilize the masses , and properly resolve their conspicuous problems earlier on , they should be examined one by one in the current activities of " reviewing the past " to have them resolved in a conscientious way .  As regards the problems which have been settled during the concentrated " three stresses " education but have cropped up again , solution should be worked out through intensified education , appropriate criticism , and proper handling .  
Again , some polling stations opened earlier than scheduled , lost votes , needed a re-vote , and even found out that votes were exchanged for cigarettes , damaging the solemn election and making the democratic election undemocratic .  
In the last three years , Shanghai 's textile industry has imposed the mandatory reduction of 863,000 units of cotton and textile spindles and equipment installed in the 1970 ' s or earlier , thus increasing the share of more advanced equipment from 30.6 percent to 61.1 percent and creating the material condition for transforming the elite of the textile industry into a " metropolitan industry . "  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
State leaders , responsible people of the relevant departments , and Taiwan entrepreneurs , Taiwan students , and other Taiwan compatriots staying in Beijing happily gathered under the same roof and cheerfully expressed their close blood-binding feelings and greeted the coming of the 2001 Spring Festival .

The decline of Tai Fu Tai is still a myth , but even before the British lease of the New Territories , in 1898 , the life at Tai Fu Tai had changed to a more village-life style , and the Man descendants , the owner of the mansion , then engaged in practical but still prosperous occupations , possibly developing some industries , like the soya-bean production , possibly in the annexe .  The various village-type activities required a firm paving in front though some of this may have been present earlier .

It goes into some length in analysing the characteristics of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong : demographic characteristics , education , labour force , living arrangement and household characteristics , and geographical characteristics .  
Peter Lau , who studied in England in his early years , was very fond of ancient European buildings , and this sentiment can be traced in many of his earlier works .  In his award winning work created in 1993 , Lau successfully combined the language of architecture and surrealism to form a richly imaginative pictorial space and a distinctive personal style .

( b ) The HKMA must not disclose information of individuals or individual authorized institutions obtained by it in the discharge of its supervisory functions .  However as I said earlier , the HKMA may , in certain cases , complete the vetting and approval process of senior management changes in banks within a few days .  The time required in the case of BOC Hong Kong 's chief executive post was about the same as that required in similar cases .  
The SARS Expert Committee , comprising 11 international , mainland and local experts , was appointed by the Chief Executive on May 28 , 2003 to carry out a comprehensive and expert study into the SARS outbreak earlier in Hong Kong , and to make recommendations on areas of improvement so that Hong Kong 's public health system could be better prepared in the future for a possible return of SARS or other infectious diseases .

But perhaps one of Ta An 's greatest attractions is a throwback to its earlier history - - the trees and grass that adorn its broader boulevards such as the elegant Jenai Road . Here , the dense foliage , chirping birds and silver spray of fountains can easily make one forget one is in the middle of a bustling commercial district .  
The scenic surroundings of the university campus inspired her creative writing , and she often contributed to literary journals . Wang has written hundreds of short stories in which a trend away from the vague earlier works to the current contemporary social dramas is apparent .  
While the intricate and exquisite works of dynastic China can be appreciated for their sheer beauty , the new collectors of folk art felt a special bond of affection for these representative pieces of an earlier , simpler time .  
Giving up on the prospect , he went home , put it in his dresser , and went out for the evening . Later that night , Ch'en heard on the radio that the grand prizewinning number was the same as that on the section of tickets which he was unable to sell . He rushed home , but only to realize that his wife had already sold the remaining ticket earlier in the evening . Every term , one winning number is chosen .  
In earlier days , the majority of schools and athletic centers in the ROC surfaced their tracks and baseball diamonds with either crushed brick or cinder . In fair weather the air was filled with dust and grit and when it rained the surfaces were pocked with puddles , causing numerous headaches and much inconvenience for their users .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
Now , the first thing we discovered wa s that that was nonsense . [ pointing at the MP speaking on the monitor ] Now he is absolutely stable , his arm is on the dispatch box and he is absolutely stuck there , If you watched the Prime Minister earlier this afternoon , however , he will lean forward then step back and turn around . Now you can not have a head and shoulders shot , so you have to have a bigger picture , which in itself is quite interesting .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
The main harvesting tools included stone sickles , stone knives , and stone shovels . Compared to the earlier Yangshao era , manufacture of stone implements by striking had given way to manufacture by grinding . Some of the more special items include jade axes with carefully and skilfully done animal face designs .  
But in earlier years , the Pu'er produced in Yunnan was not aged enough , its taste was n't smooth , and its grade was n't high . Most people did n't know that Pu'er , unlike the teas grown in Taiwan , does n't like to be sealed up and should from time to time be brought out and aired . Otherwise , in a hot and humid climate , it easily molds and rots , making it quite literally a " stinky , moldy tea . "  
The fine arts world at that time uncovered two homegrown artists , Hung Tung and Ju Ming , and the painting world was swept by a nostalgic " native realism " emphasizing things and people from local Taiwanese culture and society , and especially from the countryside . Representative artists included Hsieh Ming-chang , Ong Ching-tu , Chen Tung-yuan , and others like Hsi Teh-chin and Hsu Kun-cheng who had awakened to this style even earlier than the others .  
Herbs determined to be more effective woul dsimply replace the earlier ones used in the same prescription . There are more than 80,000 prescriptions listed in Chinese medicine reference books , but only several hundred are commonly used . Many of there maining exist in name only . Among the 13 prohibited ingredients in the list recently released by the Department of Health , otter liver , elephant skin , and bear gall secretion have been rarely prescribed for a long time now .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things . In recent years the problems of divorce and extramarital affairs have become increasingly serious , the schools have gone co-ed , boys and girls have manifold opportunities to meet , and there is information about sex everywhere one turns . Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
This exchange is the first time since the break-off of negotiations that dialogue has been conducted between the two sides . The letter sent from Taiwan on March 5th received a quick and clear response on March 11th with ARATS reiterating that they were willing to invite representatives from the SEF of " a suitable level " to lead economic , cultural or academic missions to the PRC , either to visit or participate in seminars . The opportunity to restart cross-straits negotiations can be traced back to earlier this year .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
In 1997 , after the new curricula for elementary schools had been fully implemented , Chung Ching , an assistant professor of math education at National Taipei Teachers ' College wrote in a report he made on " The Transformation of the Culture of Math Class in the Lower Grades " that those students who have been educated under the new curricula are much more " able to voice their opinions , ask questions , work with others and learn from others ' way of thinking " than earlier students who had received traditional educations .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times . For instance , although chickenpox usually produces only mild symptoms , it is potentially crippling or even fatal . Old people still believe that the earlier a child gets chickenpox the better , but despite the high price of the chickenpox vaccine now imported from America , many parents are willing to have their children immunized .  
In the analysis of Chiang Tsu-ning , head of the Secretariat of the Grand Justices , most of the private petitions raised over the years have revolved around basic constitutional rights . In earlier years , petitions concerning property rights and the right to equality before the law dominated , while in recent years such issues as human rights , gender equality and the right to liberty have come to the fore .  
Sung Ju-shan , a lecturer at Chinese Culture University , writes in her doctoral dissertation A Decade of Post-Cultural-Revolution Literature in Mainland China , " After shifting political circumstances debunked earlier values , the Red Guards who had devoted their youth to politics were faced with an urgent need to seek new meaning in life . "  
Breast cancer , for example , is likely to increase because of several risk factors : modern women start menstruation earlier , get married Based on risk factors in the environment , Chen Chien-jen estimates later , and are less likely to breast feed ; intake of animal fat is increasing ; and modern lifestyles are more stressful and erratic .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
In Zhou Chen 's Ning Qi Feeding an Ox , the brushwork of the trees and rocks is fluid and uninhibited , employing vigorous lines similar to those used in the work of Tang Yin , Qiu Ying , and even their predecessor Du Jin . The techniques in which these painters were so adept fused the artistic heritage of earlier generations , from the Tang dynasty onwards , creating a distinctive style that captured the mood of the middle Ming period .  
Wang admitted to military investigators during initial questioning that six months earlier , acting alone , he had lowered himself down from the rooftop into his neighbors ' apartment looking for money . When Wu Ming-han heard noises and woke up , Wang panicked and hacked both Wu and his wife to death with a meat cleaver . Wang then stole NT $ 6,000 before returning to his own apartment .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan-hsing . " It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "  
In the early ' 70s , his " Mourning the Moon " serigraph series was seen as the beginning of the second phase of his career . A sometimes-strong , sometimes-soft brush style took over from the coarse lines and geometric shapes of his earlier period . The " Large Calligraphy " series , executed with an airbrush , featured a combination of fascinating colors with an agile calligraphic style . The colorful Chinese characters set against a jet-black night sky are reminiscent of the fireworks of a traditional Chinese festival .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
All visitors to Lukang inevitably go exploring . Besides the three major historic sites mentioned earlier , when you stroll through the narrow streets , even without deliberately looking , you just need to raise your head and you will frequently see exquisitely carved plafonds , decorative ceramic window frames , and vases inlayed into walls , providing a stream of delightful surprises .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
Indeed , in recent years , with the government promoting the reuse of neglected spaces ( much as it promoted " holistic community building " a few years earlier ) , the seeds of creativity and idealism have been planted in cities , towns and rural hamlets . Idle and abandoned century-old buildings , whether publicly or privately owned , have sprung to life again . Meanwhile , a connection has been discovered between preserving memories of the past and promoting the arts .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
The works of Han Han are most representative of this genre and are very popular with younger readers . When he was 16 , Han Han became an overnight sensation with the publication of his novel Three Doors . Not academically inclined , he decided against attending Fudan University in Shanghai after graduating from high school . The rebellious nature of his books brings to mind Refusing to Take the Joint Entrance Exam , which was written by Wu Hsiang-hui in Taiwan two decades earlier .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
Six months earlier , when the team of prospective climbers from subtropical Taiwan submitted their application , the authorities had misgivings because of the youth of the applicants . Later when they realized that the students had quite a bit of high-mountain experience and had received training for snowy regions , they gave the green light .  
The technician , responsible for recording the meteorological data , gets up at around 4:50 a.m . , and half an hour earlier in winter , because it is necessary to clean off the overnight rime that has coated the equipment , with hot water .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
but kohl emphasized that the conditions set for the economic and monetary union by the maastricht treaty should not be relaxed this is a change from his position earlier when he called for a postponement of the timetable by one or two years in view of the crisis of the european monetary system  
Kemp and China 's Minister of Education Chen Zhili renewed earlier today a memorandum of understanding on educational and training cooperation , in which senior education , professional and technical education , far distance education are decided as priority fields for bilateral cooperation  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
At their meeting earlier this month , the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean Community again expressed grave concern at the recurring threat posed to the region through the marine transport of irradiated nuclear fuel , plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
The leaders of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs advocated the speedy holding in Moscow of the next , fourth , round of inter-Tajik talks , at which the fundamental questions of a political settlement must be discussed in a constructive spirit in accordance with the agenda for the talks agreed upon earlier by the parties .  
The heavy emphasis on French language acquisition at the expense of mother tongue learning in the earlier primary grades may also be contributing to the overall low achievement levels being measured in mathematics and science skills among the majority of Djiboutian children sitting French public examinations .  
Reports of rape and sexual violence constituting violations of international humanitarian law continue to be received , although to a lesser extent than earlier in the conflict .  However , the international community needs to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the sexual atrocities against women , children and men do not reoccur on the scale reported in 1992 and 1993 .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .

MOCHOCHOKO ( Lesotho ) said that the draft statute was a considerable improvement over the earlier draft , but needed to be further strengthened to ensure that it created a just , fair and effective international criminal institution .  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
In accordance with the draft resolution contained in document A / 50 / L . 72 , introduced earlier by the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Group of Friends , the General Assembly would decide , following the recommendation of the Secretary-General , to establish a small United Nations Office of Verification ( ONUV ) , headed by an official at the appropriate political level , which would be entrusted with verifying the implementation of pending aspects of the peace agreements in El Salvador until 31 December 1996 .  
In the meantime , we are pleased that the five major international summits organized by the United Nations , ranging from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year , have proved to be useful in enabling Member States to focus on the various aspects of development and to cultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategy for cooperation among themselves .  
Let me recall in this context that Ambassador Somav \ x { 71f0 } of Chile , in his statement earlier this morning , spoke about the great international consensus formulated at Copenhagen . The Summit articulated , in a systematic and coherent manner , a set of basic and very demanding commitments and an ambitious Programme which has the potential to be a major contribution to the shaping of world economic and social policies in the decades to come .  
Towards this end the New Agenda , which built on the frustrations of the earlier United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development ( 1986-1990 ) , set out in definitive terms a global compact of intent between Africa and the United Nations system on the one hand and between Africa and the international community on the other .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
The facts revealed since this aircraft began to be used , as set out in our aforementioned letters , in addition to the ill repute the aircraft has acquired following earlier spy flights over other parts of the world , require that the United Nations re-examine the issue of continued forcible use of the aircraft by the United States of America to violate Iraq 's airspace in a manner totally incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as they relate to respect for the sovereignty of all Member States .  
While it was true that the current system of 12 hours of meetings daily required overtime payments for the servicing of evening and night meetings , the expenditure thus incurred would remain within the budgetary limits authorized for the period in question because of the restrictions which had been imposed earlier in the session .  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .  
To our disappointment , however , not only have military actions continued , but they have in fact intensified , as evident in the brutal shelling of the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) compound earlier today , which has taken the lives of yet more innocent civilians .  
Most of them continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , but with notable weak spots , and in many cases their growth was not sufficient to reduce the social deficits accumulated in earlier years .  
Private consumption has also been weighed down by a number of other factors : higher taxes and social security charges and reductions in governmental transfers have dampened the growth of disposable income ; and in some countries the weakness of the housing market and the persistence of negative equity in privately owned houses , as well as the continued reduction of earlier levels of indebtedness , have also discouraged spending .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
Although most of the countries in Latin America continued progressing towards macroeconomic stability with growth , which is so essential for creating an atmosphere conducive to strengthening regional cooperation , in many areas their growth was not sufficient to reduce the " social deficits " accumulated in earlier years . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
Act No . 10 / 1994 of 19 May on urgent job promotion measures , published on 23 May 1994 , continues the public funding established earlier by Act No . 22 / 1992 of 30 July on urgent measures to promote employment and provide unemployment protection , which had established a government programme to promote hiring on indefinite contracts , with 500,000 pesetas earmarked ( sixth additional provision ) for promotion of the recruitment of women in professions in which they are under-represented .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
An amended and expanded version of this bill was enacted into United States law on 12 March 1996 , despite the international community 's rejection of it and the fact that the United States Administration had earlier opposed the bill because it was inconsistent with the obligations of the United States of America under the rules of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , and because of potential conflicts - indefensible under international law - with its allies .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
As explained in an earlier report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / C . 5 / 49 / 64 , para . 8 ) , the costs of staff representational activities and the staff-management consultative process can be identified as both direct costs against the regular budget and indirect costs in terms of the release of staff from their assigned programme duties .  
The role of the universities , equipped with scientific councils representing the teaching and research institutions and research personnel and elected under a democratic system independent of the Administration , has shown considerable improvement over the earlier situation ( regulated by Act No . 86-80 of 9 August 1986 ) .  
As emphasized earlier , in the delicate conditions prevalent in new and restored democracies , there is a need to coordinate what may otherwise be disjointed actions of non-governmental organizations not only with governmental plans , but also with assistance provided by bilateral donors and multilateral organizations . 
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
The following changes had been made to the text : the fifth preambular paragraph stressed the need for consolidating the existing bodies of international humanitarian law and the need for wide dissemination and full implementation of such law at the international level ; the wording of paragraph 4 had been brought into line with that of the fifth preambular paragraph ; and , in paragraph 5 , the reference to " preventive measures " in the earlier text had been deleted .  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
With respect to the age of recruitment into the armed forces ( art . , UNHCR , consistent with the position stated above , insists that the minimum age for either compulsory or voluntary recruitment into the armed forces should be set at 18 years , and does not agree that earlier recruitment should be acceptable with parental consent . 
Yet its subsequent , rapid spread through tainted blood and heterosexual activity increased public concern , leading to actions that , if taken earlier , would have saved many lives .  
At another level , the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its concern over the Afghan problem in the final communiqu of the ministerial meeting held at New Delhi earlier this month and expressed the need for the Afghan parties to move towards national reconciliation , in accordance with the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions .  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
Referring to a statement made at an earlier meeting by the representative of Australia that had contained allegations about the human rights situation in Iraq , he said that such allegations were motivated by political considerations which had nothing to do with human rights ; they were not based on any real evidence and they lacked balance .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
Those standing in the way of the Dayton Accords and continuing to defy the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of two equal entities and three constituent peoples have to be confronted with the same uncompromising determination of the international community , and , if required , with the same measures as were earlier applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which proved to be entirely necessary and productive .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
We warmly commend the timely initiative taken by Canada in convening earlier this month an international meeting of countries that have committed themselves and taken national action to advance a global ban on anti-personnel landmines .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
Policy will in future need to give more attention to improving individual choice and flexibility : to allowing people to continue to work when they wish or need to do so , while encouraging those who can retire earlier to take up socially productive activities , remunerated or not , part-time or casual , as appropriate , and to create the conditions for this broader recognition of work and employment .  
First , while the earlier debate was characterized largely by fears of important contradictions between trade and environment policies , the post-UNCED debate has focused on exploring the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection , and has enlarged the development dimension in the discussion on most issues .  Conceptual and empirical analyses and debate have helped to set aside some of the early fears of incompatibility between trade and environment policies which could have induced inappropriate policy choices .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
Anti-dumping proceedings have been criticized on grounds of inadequate examinations as to whether imported and domestic products fall , in fact , within the same quality segment , lax determinations of causality between dumping and injury , neglect of consumer interests and the legal possibility to file new complaints whenever earlier complaints regarding the same import product have been unsuccessful . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 15 \ x { ffff } . 
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
The lessons learned earlier in Rwanda and Somalia , and in Afghanistan during 1996 , showed that as long as political mediation , military and security operations , emergency relief and development assistance operated largely as independent policy instruments , the international response to large-scale violence would be incoherent and ineffective .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
Other activities included working jointly with the World Bank on ( a ) a revised and updated Glossary of the legal and economic terms fundamental to competition law and policy ( to be published in 1997 ) , an earlier version of which has been translated into several languages , including Russian and Spanish ; and ( b ) a Competition Manual for transition and developing countries ( to be published in 1997 ) .  
The charts and relevant information , including geodetic data , describing the outer limits of the continental shelf , which are deposited by the coastal State with the Secretary-General and which are to be given due publicity by the Secretary-General in accordance with article 76 , paragraph 9 , of the Convention , shall cease to be classified as confidential , if they had been so classified earlier , upon their receipt by the Secretary-General .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
Having received no response to the request he made in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur reiterates the urgent request he made to the existing Government to provide , as promised earlier by Major Buyoya , the results of the investigation into allegations of the expulsion manu militari of 392 Burundian refugees in Rwanda to Cibitoke province , on 30 September 1996 , by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , at a time when numerous violations of human rights were being reported in that region .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic edifice by hindering economic development .  
DIOP ( Senegal ) supported the view expressed by earlier speakers that a strong , independent Prosecutor empowered to obtain information ex officio was crucial if the Court was to be effective .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
As noted earlier ( see chap.I , General legislative considerations , _ _ _ _ ) , in some legal systems belonging to the civil law tradition , the provision of public services is governed by a body of law known as administrative law , which governs a wide range of governmental functions .  
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .  For the 87 programmes that were ongoing on 1 January 1999 , the total expenditure rates are generally higher the earlier the programme started , with some exceptions .  
Given earlier experiences with international initiatives regarding African diversification , it can be expected that this approach and the preparatory phase will provide a better and more substantive base for the generation of financial and technical support , and equip the entrepreneurs in closing the connectivity gap that exists between them and the world markets .  
Consistency with current international law requires that the child be defined as every human being below the age of eighteen years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier ( article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( resolution 44 / 25 , annex ) ) .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In the five months that have elapsed , many people have registered to participate , and the Government has selected 181 of them ; dates have been set and postponed ; venues have been selected and changed ; the proposed facilitators referred to earlier have visited the country ; and three committees have been established .  However , a national debate has yet to be held , and only the Organizational Committee is in operation .  
Mr . Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Since the launching of that initiative three years earlier , only a few countries had been given HIPC packages , which had proved to be a mixed blessing because the structural adjustment policies required of those countries had been detrimental to the very people whom debt relief had been intended to help .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
These earlier , elite , academic secondary schools ( based on the values of elitism and excellence ) and the later religious , popular schools bifurcated access to education ; schools were segregated by religion and class .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
In a climate of ethnic intolerance and total disrespect for international law , UNPROFOR earlier and the High Representative later ensured that fair , objective , tolerant radio and television as well as newspapers received adequate international support , while broadcasting licences for other stations were withdrawn , and the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) took control of transmitters when necessary .  
As a consequence , the Secretary-General submitted an updated revised budget for MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 in the amount of $ 47 , 402 , 100 gross ( $ 44 , 419 , 700 net ) ( see A 52-730 Add . 2 ) , which reflected the additional requirements for demining activities while at the same time revising downward the additional requirements for the identification process set out in his earlier report ( A 52-730 ) . 
With the uncertainties associated with the transitional nature of the global order , a tremendous obsession is evident to preserve military supremacy or assume a more prominent global role in the future order through acquisition of more advanced weapons of greater range , accuracy and lethality , something that might quite unravel the progress towards disarmament achieved earlier in this decade .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
In instances where the claimant only had annual records or had insufficient monthly records to perform a valid projection of revenue for the compensation periods , and these records were stated in Israeli shekels , the Panel concluded that the use of annual data from earlier years as a basis for the projection of revenue , without taking into account the level of inflation in Israel at the time , would create a distortion .  
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
As mentioned earlier , the enormous number of landmines planted in such vast areas of my country has altered the demographic structure by hindering economic development .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely , that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
He noted that the Paris Declaration of 10 years earlier still rang true today , namely that development will rest on the effectiveness of national policies , a favourable international economic climate , and a strengthened partnership based on mutual commitment .  
The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .  
During the discussion held in the Commission in 2000 , it was concluded that common rules could be elaborated relating to certain issues concerning unilateral acts , but not relating to all aspects , which led to the earlier exercise on the classification of unilateral acts on which the draft articles to be prepared by the Commission on this subject would be based .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
Its main purpose is to move ahead and explore other priority areas touched upon in the earlier documents prepared by the Special Rapporteur , namely the problem of definition and of the actors involved in the exercise or use of terrorist activity , the development of new forms of terrorism and the probability of mass destruction terrorism and , finally , a number of issues associated with the consequences of terrorism for human rights .  
Regional economic groups formed earlier are now being energized and new groups with diverse objectives such as free trade , investment cooperation , transport integration , harmonized social action or integrated resource use are being formed . 
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
Provision of basic legal , technical and tactical advice to investigators , prosecutors or other officials about the foreign implications of early investigative measures , based on the experiences of earlier cases ;
