Magistrate Lo Pui Yin pointed out that the defendant had substantive control over the complainant such as when and how the beautician worked , what services were to be provided by the beautician and the obligations imposed on the beautician to observe the detailed staff rules .  Besides , @ noting that a regular monthly basic salary was paid to the beautician , the court ruled that the beautician was an employee of the defendant .

An insurance company usually takes into account the risks involved and other commercial considerations when deciding whether to accept an application for motor vehicle third party risks insurance cover , and if so , how to set the level of premium .  The assessment criteria include : the purpose , age and conditions of the vehicle ; number of claims made in the past and amount paid ; as well as the driving records of the concerned persons ; etc .  
" As to poor families in public housing , the Government has put in place all the elements of a comprehensive safety net .  Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Having taken into account the guilty plea and that the tax involved had been fully paid , the defendant was sentenced to a total fine of $ 50,000 odd , which was equivalent to about 25% of the tax undercharged in consequence of the incorrect tax returns filed .  
In other words , the pay of public officers remunerated on starting salaries as of October 1 , 2002 would remain unchanged until such time when concerned officers qualify for an increment after which their salaries would be paid in accordance with their respective adjusted pay scales .

Home visits have also been paid to elderly families to send out the message and render possible assistance .  Mr . Lau called on public housing tenants to maintain good personal hygiene habits by keeping their home and the estates clean .  He reiterated the idea of nourishing a new culture on cleanliness in public housing estates , adding that the marking scheme was only meant for the very minority of tenants who jeopardize the tidiness of the environment in irresponsible and inconsiderate acts .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
During the period from 1945 to 1949 , for example , just after the country had experienced eight years of war and destitution , some angry young people chose Marxism , believing it to be a magic panacea , a short cut to Utopia . Today these people , now old men and women , must deeply regret the mistaken choice they made back then , or they may have already paid the price for it with their lives .  
The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
If we look at it from a planning point of view , today 's social disorder shows the shortcomings of the government 's planned investments in social affairs . In the past economic growth was stressed , environmental protection deemphasized ; the environmental protection movement is the inevitable price to be paid . Everyone must acknowledge this , only then can the truth be understood .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
Stalin , who massacred the intellectuals , paid special attention to genetics , psychology , applied mathematics and computers , which he saw as products of capitalism , and on the basis of pseudoscientific theories he ordered the schools to suspend any relevant teaching . " At that time a deadly atmosphere hung over academic circles , " says Karapetjants Artemi , a senior collaborator in Chinese languages .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
Relatively speaking , Mr . Chang 's modus operandi was very open and generous . He liked cast-of-thousands films that required large investments . Ms . Tung , on the other hand , was more restrained and prudent , and she paid attention to the efficiency of the expenditures , " points out Chen You-hsin , an old-time marquee attraction who often took part in Hsinhua productions . As a result , under their joint direction , Hsinhua had just the right functional balance of boldness and reserve .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Finding an heir in a test tube : Even though Taiwan 's in vitro fertilization technology has reached an international standard , Liu Chi-hung feels concern that little attention is paid within the country to basic research . " Everyone is only anxious to study the procedures , without researching the underlying reasons . They just understand the superficial results ; when they run into problems , they 're lost at sea . "  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
The country grew rich , and in 1938 the Labour government introduced the world 's most comprehensive social welfare system . New Zealanders , born with a silver spoon in their mouths , not only had their education , living expenses and health care paid for completely by the state , even their mothers looking after them could collect money from the government .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
Brightly burning incense is looked upon by the faithful as a sacred sign . The urn glowed brightly just after Hsu Hsin-liang , the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman who is deciding whether to pursue an independent presidential candidacy , paid his respects to the icon .  
Furthermore , the site stated that the " Palm Thunder " guns , sold for US $ 250 , must be paid for anonymously , and that deals would be processed only after payment was received , leading police to suspect fraudulent behavior .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments . Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria . Since the display for the nostalgia lunches still had n't been set up , the TRA assumed that the crowd were queuing for train tickets , and paid them no heed .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
According to estimates of the Council of Labor Affairs ( CLA ) , once these two acts are finally revised and implemented a retired worker with 30 years of service will be able to receive a monthly insurance annuity of some 30% of his pre-retirement insured salary . Add to this a retirement account of 24.3% of pre-retirement salary and you get a total of more than 54% of a worker 's pre-retirement salary being paid out . This should meet the needs of the worker and his family and contribute to social peace and stability .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .

Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .

At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
This year enterprises should strive to make new progress in this respect so as to raise their level of scientific management .  Apart from this , attention should be paid to the overall adjustment of the economy .  This includes the elimination of backward productive forces , rectification and standardization of the market , creation of a favorable environment for the development of economic sectors of different ownership systems , and improvement of the quality and efficiency of economic operations .

The motion , to be proposed by Hon James Tien , says " That , to ensure that the fees to be paid by the public and industrial and commercial establishments under the " user-pays " principle are reasonable , fair and affordable , this Council urges the Government to adopt effective measures to strengthen cost control in the government and quasi-government organizations concerned so as to cut down unnecessary expenditure on bureaucratic administration . "  
Note : The growth in nominal and real payrolls per person engaged has likely been biased upwards for two reasons .  First , redundancies have been concentrated on lower paid workers , thus resulting in an increase in measured average payrolls per person with no rise in labor cost for remaining employees .  
" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .  This is because the supply for vehicular use of light diesel oil with a sulphur content higher than 0.05% is prohibited under the Air Pollution Control ( Motor Vehicle Fuel ) Regulations .  
After the WCO Policy Commission , Mr Tsang paid a visit to the Customs Administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran from December 10 to 12 .  During the visit , the Customs Heads of both administrations exchanged views on a wide range of Customs administrative and enforcement subjects .  Both sides also explored the possibility of furthering the existing level of co-operation and agreed to finalize the issue in the near future .

I have received a complaint in which a veteran Senior Graduate Master ( SGM ) who has changed his job from a Direct Subsidy Scheme secondary school to take up a Graduate Master ( " GM " ) post in an aided secondary school is paid a salary equivalent to the starting pay of a newly-inducted GM plus incremental credit for his recognized experience .  
Magistrate Lo Pui Yin pointed out that the defendant had substantive control over the complainant such as when and how the beautician worked , what services were to be provided by the beautician and the obligations imposed on the beautician to observe the detailed staff rules .  Besides , @ noting that a regular monthly basic salary was paid to the beautician , the court ruled that the beautician was an employee of the defendant .  
To make thorough researches on local customs and culture , the creative team paid seven visits to Tibet . Several hundreds sets of costumes of different Tibetan nationalities are specially designed for this production .  On the source of music , sounds from real environment are collected like sound of one hundred revolving scripts at Dazhao Temple , sound of water flowing from Yarlung Zangbo River , sound of chiming of script by over one hundred lamas , singing of herdsmen , and many more .

An insurance company usually takes into account the risks involved and other commercial considerations when deciding whether to accept an application for motor vehicle third party risks insurance cover , and if so , how to set the level of premium .  The assessment criteria include : the purpose , age and conditions of the vehicle ; number of claims made in the past and amount paid ; as well as the driving records of the concerned persons ; etc .  
" As to poor families in public housing , the Government has put in place all the elements of a comprehensive safety net .  Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Having taken into account the guilty plea and that the tax involved had been fully paid , the defendant was sentenced to a total fine of $ 50,000 odd , which was equivalent to about 25% of the tax undercharged in consequence of the incorrect tax returns filed .

Home visits have also been paid to elderly families to send out the message and render possible assistance .  Mr . Lau called on public housing tenants to maintain good personal hygiene habits by keeping their home and the estates clean .  He reiterated the idea of nourishing a new culture on cleanliness in public housing estates , adding that the marking scheme was only meant for the very minority of tenants who jeopardize the tidiness of the environment in irresponsible and inconsiderate acts .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
During the period from 1945 to 1949 , for example , just after the country had experienced eight years of war and destitution , some angry young people chose Marxism , believing it to be a magic panacea , a short cut to Utopia . Today these people , now old men and women , must deeply regret the mistaken choice they made back then , or they may have already paid the price for it with their lives .  
The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
If we look at it from a planning point of view , today 's social disorder shows the shortcomings of the government 's planned investments in social affairs . In the past economic growth was stressed , environmental protection deemphasized ; the environmental protection movement is the inevitable price to be paid . Everyone must acknowledge this , only then can the truth be understood .  
From the green-house effect , global climatic change , acid rain , the hole in the ozone layer , destruction of the rain forests , conservation of animal and plant species in the wild , to desertification and the shrinkage of marine mammals , all of this was very little discussed and paid scant attention .  
Stalin , who massacred the intellectuals , paid special attention to genetics , psychology , applied mathematics and computers , which he saw as products of capitalism , and on the basis of pseudoscientific theories he ordered the schools to suspend any relevant teaching . " At that time a deadly atmosphere hung over academic circles , " says Karapetjants Artemi , a senior collaborator in Chinese languages .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
Today it is seen as backward . You could say this is a product of a capitalist society . But the price will be paid for by future generations who will rely on the earth for survival , " says Chang Kuo-lung . He does not believe that a simple , conservationist lifestyle is necessarily uninteresting or dry ; on the contrary it is full of the fun of creativity .  
Relatively speaking , Mr . Chang 's modus operandi was very open and generous . He liked cast-of-thousands films that required large investments . Ms . Tung , on the other hand , was more restrained and prudent , and she paid attention to the efficiency of the expenditures , " points out Chen You-hsin , an old-time marquee attraction who often took part in Hsinhua productions . As a result , under their joint direction , Hsinhua had just the right functional balance of boldness and reserve .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Finding an heir in a test tube : Even though Taiwan 's in vitro fertilization technology has reached an international standard , Liu Chi-hung feels concern that little attention is paid within the country to basic research . " Everyone is only anxious to study the procedures , without researching the underlying reasons . They just understand the superficial results ; when they run into problems , they 're lost at sea . "  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
On this day they paid honor to the flag god and inspected the military troops . " Swords and spears bright as snow , banners bright and colorful " accompanied the cold , harsh autumn . It truly carried a sad chill : " The brave warrior goes off , never to return " !  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
Kung Peng-cheng , now a professor in the Graduate Institute of History at Chung Cheng University and tapped to be president of the future Fo Kuang University , sees part of the problem as being innate to education in a capitalist system . Students pay tuition , while professors are paid by the credit . " It 's ridiculous to ask the students to respect the teachers in a situation where knowledge is assigned a monetary value . "  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
The country grew rich , and in 1938 the Labour government introduced the world 's most comprehensive social welfare system . New Zealanders , born with a silver spoon in their mouths , not only had their education , living expenses and health care paid for completely by the state , even their mothers looking after them could collect money from the government .  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
Brightly burning incense is looked upon by the faithful as a sacred sign . The urn glowed brightly just after Hsu Hsin-liang , the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman who is deciding whether to pursue an independent presidential candidacy , paid his respects to the icon .  
Furthermore , the site stated that the " Palm Thunder " guns , sold for US $ 250 , must be paid for anonymously , and that deals would be processed only after payment was received , leading police to suspect fraudulent behavior .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments . Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
On June 8th , after the news broke , even before the sales of the normal boxed lunches at midday , there were already massive queues of eager customers waiting at the station cafeteria . Since the display for the nostalgia lunches still had n't been set up , the TRA assumed that the crowd were queuing for train tickets , and paid them no heed .  
Meanwhile the assistant secretary-general of the Chinese Youth Development Fund ( CYDF ) , Xu Yongguang , also paid a visit to Nan in Hong Kong . The CYDF is most famous for " Project Hope , " which gave poor rural children a shot at education , and once Xu heard Nan 's ideas on classical education , he put into action a successor project for classical studies based around ancient poetry and classical texts .  
According to estimates of the Council of Labor Affairs ( CLA ) , once these two acts are finally revised and implemented a retired worker with 30 years of service will be able to receive a monthly insurance annuity of some 30% of his pre-retirement insured salary . Add to this a retirement account of 24.3% of pre-retirement salary and you get a total of more than 54% of a worker 's pre-retirement salary being paid out . This should meet the needs of the worker and his family and contribute to social peace and stability .  
Pakistan , saying it would conduct successive missile tests from 25th to 28th , paid no attention to UN 's call for constraint , having launched 2 missiles , which can be equipped with nuclear warheads .  One of the missiles was Hatf-v ( Ghauri ) missile that can hit targets deep inside India and the other was newly developed short ranged Ghaznavi missile .  
He said that since its founding five years ago , Eximbank has established an effective risk preventing mechanism in extending loans , and that the quality of the bank 's credit assets remains high , and the principal and interest of mature financial bonds have all been paid , ensuring the rights and interests of creditors

The creation of the United Nations 50 years ago awakened tremendous hopes for mankind , which had , in the space of a single generation , suffered from two particularly savage wars with consequences that sorely affected the entire world and for which all peoples paid a heavy toll . 
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
It was agreed that the phasing out of environmentally unfriendly economic practices , in particular input subsidies , needed careful examination , with special attention being paid to distributive problems , especially that of the negative impact on the poor .  
Create and modify programmes and policies that recognize and strengthen women 's vital role in food security and provide paid and unpaid women producers , especially those involved in food production , such as farming , fishing and aquaculture as well as urban enterprises , with equal access to appropriate technologies , transportation , extension services , marketing and credit facilities at the local and community levels ;  
FAO provides for international travel , essential internal travel , medical and insurance coverage and a supplement to the living expenses of the expert directly paid to him or her , while the host country provides for boarding , lodging and laundry and the releasing country pays the salary of the expert .  
However , in June 1994 the United Nations Secretariat decided to abandon this project which , though already paid for by the Organization , was no longer considered realistic in terms of the recurrent costs and practical procedures required to operate the electronic access system .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
The main topics of discussion will be determining which priority projects still needed to be executed and the means required for refocusing public interest and donor attention on Chernobyl , with special attention paid to ways of marking the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl on 26 April 1996 .
