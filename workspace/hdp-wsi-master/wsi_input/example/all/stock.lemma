Annette Lu is a so-called master of law , but unexpectedly she knows nothing about the history and geography of her own nation .  She has ignored logic , reasoning and legal principles , and wantonly spread splittist ideas .

The Bush camp 's sinister tactics infuriated the Clinton administration .  The White House economic advisors headed by Gene Sperling made frequent appearance in the news media in an attempt to refute the Bush camp by citing specific economic figures .  However , their timing was unfortunately not right .  The stock market on the Wall Street was dropping precipitously , resulting in less money left in American people 's pockets .  The defense by Sperling and others appeared powerless in the face of Bush 's veiled attack .  This has created enmity between the two sides .

According to the technical norms of market regulatory systems that stock markets have applied to trace irregular trading activities , the China Security Regulatory Commission conducted quantitative analyses in a specific period of time and found that this corporation had engaged in such irregular business more than 10,000 times .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on .

The CSRC requested that based on the requirements contained in this guidance securities companies conduct a review of the lead underwriting they have done in the year 2000 for initial public offering , additional issues of stock , and allotments by listed companies .  
Due to the perverse behavior of the Chen Shui-bian government over the past year , the Taiwan stock market has weakened , the foreign exchange market is depressed , and industry and commerce face unprecedented difficulties , on top of which cross-strait relations are deadlocked and have retrogressed rather than advancing .  Industrial confidence on the island has collapsed and business has been forced to invest abroad for the sake of its existence .  
Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .  All these factors effectively played a role in supporting Taiwan 's stock market .  
Article 2 : These guiding opinions are applicable to those joint stock limited companies that were formed in accordance with the " Company Law " and are planning to make an initial public offering of shares ( hereinafter referred to as " companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market " ) within the People 's Republic of China .

Over the past year , Taiwan 's stock market has fallen tremendously , foreign investment has shrunken , financial crises are lurking , a large number of businesses have gone bankrupt or moved away , and the rate of unemployment is rising steadily .  Forty percent of the people who supported A-Bian in the past say that they will not vote for him again .  
A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
A series of recent indices show that Taiwan 's economy has continued to deteriorate , with the amount of export sales orders received dropping substantially , the jobless rate climbing steadily , and the stock market failing to recover from its setbacks .  With the business condition signal for May flashing the sixth blue light in a row , the Taiwan economic situation is grimmer than ever before .  This is the inevitable outcome of the Taiwan authorities ' perverse acts .

The government is worried because the price-to-earning ratio of the shares of listed companies on the mainland is as high as 60-70 times , far exceeding the average level around the world and because more than 200-billion yuan of enterprises ' deposits are floating in the stock market over an extended period of time waiting for a chance to turn a quick profit .  
Experts believe that the current significant fluctuation in China 's stock market is a normal cyclical change , and is favorable for removing the stock market bubble .

Consequently , investors should have confidence .  
According to sources , the central bank is really devoted to such vigorous investigation into and coping with the illegal operation of credit funds in the stock market , and it ordered such funds to be withdrawn within three months - - that is before end of September .

What is worse , in so doing , major shareholders have seriously violated the principle of " being open , fair , and impartial , " namely , a principle governing the stock market , and have directly encroached upon small and medium-sized investors ' legitimate rights and interests as well .  
Now that the CSCC has decided to place on file for investigation and prosecution both the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . and the people involved in its irregularities , circulating a notice criticizing the relevant law-violation and rule-violation behaviors , this has signaled a major move made by China 's securities control authorities aimed at restructuring listed companies in terms of management , and has demonstrated China 's securities control authorities ' firm resolve in ruthlessly cracking down on irregularities in the stock market as well .  
Both markets posted an average gain of more than nine percent at the close , with the total volume of transaction almost touching 50 billion .  This was typical of a market situation where stock prices and transaction volumes go up hand in hand .

Moreover , since Taiwan investors are worried about the prospects of cross-strait ties , they will rush to sell off their shares .  They expected Taiwan stock market prices would successively plummet in the near future .  Most securities analysts are pessimistic and refused to predict how long the bearish market will last .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .

He said : " It is not a packaging problem now .  
As the state 's stock of grain was doubled and redoubled between 1995 and 1999 , and the grain stored in peasant households exceeded 500 kg per capita during the same period , equivalent to two years ' quantity for personal consumption , we can believe that the total net import volume of 30.19 million tonnes in 1995 and 1996 was not a result of real demand due to domestic grain shortage .  
That included a net savings deposit drop for May of 34.1 billion yuan , which was due mainly to the brisk stock market and hot-selling treasury bonds converting some savings into investment , and the increased individual consumption for the " 1 May " holiday also cutting into some savings .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .

The government and the opposition parties are engaged in wave after wave of defensive and offensive battles centering on the issues , such as mainland policy , economic policy , and coalition cabinet .  Moreover , there are divergent voices within the ruling authorities and the DPP and the stock market has been sluggish for a long time .  These situations have to do with the current chaotic and uncertain cross-strait situation .  
Previously , some individual investors felt they were being deceived by the speculation in reorganized stock market assets .  Usually when the substantive conditions of stocks was made public , the stock prices of the reorganized stocks had risen due to speculation .  The investment value became overdrawn .  Some investors or misguided people who were becoming firmly entangled complained that they had suffered losses because the market information was not transparent and that was unfair .

and 4 ) allowing foreign-invested enterprises that come up to the required standards to be listed in China 's stock markets trading A-shares and B-shares , expanding the business ranges of the investment companies established by multinational corporations in China , simplifying the procedures for examination and approval , screening and adjusting pertinent policies that are detrimental to the absorption of foreign capital , and so on .  
Meanwhile , several large-scale enterprises in Taiwan are facing a financial crisis , natural disasters have occurred repeatedly in agricultural production , and farmers have difficulties in selling their products despite falling prices .

The Taiwan stock market has been all gloomy since the new Taiwan authorities assumed power .  The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .  
The meeting attendees exchanged views on relevant issues , including the current conditions of China 's information industry , its strategies for developing the information industry , the Chinese Government 's policies governing listings of Chinese high-tech companies on overseas stock markets and domestic second-board stock markets , the development of US information technology and information industry , the development of information technology and information industry , and investments in information industry .  
At the same time , with the improvement of the competitive environment for telecommunications , the increase of state support for the telecommunications industry , and the successful initial public offering by the China United Telecommunications Corporation in the New York and Hong Kong stock markets at the end of June , it is expected that the China United Telecommunications Corporation 's business will rapidly increase in the second half of the year , its market share will expand , and its investment ability will also be further strengthened .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
The article pointed out : Since Taiwan 's " premier " has been changed recently , the political situation of the island has been shaky and unstable .  The stock market has slumped , grumbling by the people is heard everywhere , and voices of condemning the leadership of the Taiwan authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party are lingering on incessantly .  
The opposition parties believe that Taiwan 's leader puts undue emphasis on ideology , defies public opinion , undermines established systems , and tramples on the consultation and mutual trust mechanism between the ruling and opposition parties .  They believe that as a result of this , the economy is depressed , the unemployment rate is rising , the stock market is dropping , and the people 's wealth is sharply diminishing .  
Because of well-developed IT infrastructure and the appearance of many intelligent buildings and wired communities and because net life and information-based consumption are accessible to ordinary citizens , more and more people can experience the virtues of distance learning , distance medical care , digital library , and shopping , house search , stock trading , and sightseeing on cyberspace .  
Their sideline and disadvantageous businesses will be diverted elsewhere so that the operating costs will be substantially reduced , the transfer and use of funds will be more effective , and the core businesses can achieve more rapid development .  As regards some companies that have been listed in the stock markets , their assets will be sold subject to the approval of the shareholders ' meetings and in accordance with the practices prevailing in Hong Kong .  
Economically , stock prices have fallen sharply , the real estate market is sluggish , many traditional industries have totally moved out of the island , and a financial storm is looming ahead .  The economy has continued to decline , and with the end of the year drawing near , enterprises are meeting with difficulties in settling their debts , while there is a sharp rise in the number of jobless people .  Because of this , the local people have no confidence in Taiwan 's future .  
The DPP 's numerous domestic policy changes , which are rife with contradictions , have accelerated foreign migration of industries and capital and caused severe depression in the stock market , depreciation of the Taiwan dollar , and considerable shrinkage of people 's assets .  
According to the economists , apart from the possible adverse impacts that may be produced by another sharp rise in oil prices or a drastic drop in the stock market , there currently exist three imbalances in the US economy , that is , the negative rate of personal savings , the piling debt burdens of both enterprises and households , and the huge deficits on the country 's current account .  These imbalances may add to the gravity of problems when the country 's economic growth is slowing down .  
It has been pointed out that based on evidence it had gathered over the years , the Investigation Bureau has found out that the customary tactics employed by the mainland are to put Chinese investment into foreign companies based in our country , have a hand in Taiwan 's stock market , and spread rumors in the market in an attempt to cause severe damage to our stock market and our economy .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .  
Simplify industrial and commercial registration procedures for S &amp; T personnel who head to the west to open S &amp; T-oriented enterprises there .  Raise the ceilings for stock ownership , futures ownership , and intellectual property ownership relative to the total capital of an enterprise .  
The animal farming industry should quicken the pace of improving stock breeds and structural adjustments , actively develop the fodder industry and the refined and in-depth processing of animal products , and greatly advance the industrial operation .  
Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
A comparatively feasible way is to do something on the denominator of the stock market profit rate equation .  In other words , the internal reform of stock companies should be intensified , their business results improved , and their profit making ability enhanced , so that stock market profit rates will return to a comparatively rational level .  
Sixth , the difficulties faced by private enterprises in the aspect of financing are being gradually resolved ; and both the number and the proportion of private enterprises listed in the stock market will be increased , and these listed companies are expected to form the mainstay of the secondary market .  
It is noteworthy that there are similar stipulations in the " Company Law " and the " Securities Law . " Given that shell resources for listed companies were still very precious and the withdrawal of listed companies from the stock market would have a bearing on social stability , the management and local governments " repeatedly put up with " these trash stocks without mercilessly delisting them and adopted a mild attitude toward chronically loss-making companies .  
China Securities Regulatory Commission has of late promulgated " Measures for Listed Companies To Suspend or Terminate Listing on a Stock Market , " which has spelled out detailed regulations for listed companies with outstanding losses for three years in a row , to suspend , resume , or terminate listing on a stock market .  The " Measures " has also laid down requirements , legal procedures , measures for information disclosure , rights for settlement , and so on in this regard .  
Indeed , quite a few strange phenomena have emerged on China 's stock market .  For instance , it has become common practice for a listed company , after finding itself in the red , to reorganize its own assets .  Soon afterwards , its shares are bound to rise by an extraordinary margin , and this is usually " very successful . "  
He said : Since people from the Taiwan independence faction successively joined the Taiwan government , the central government has watched its movement with a critical eye to see what the Taiwan independence people are capable of .  In the past year , Taiwan 's economy has remained in the doldrums and the stock market has fallen sharply , and there has been an outflow of capital and boisterous complaints by the people .  It looks like there is no way out for Taiwan independence .  
Hong Kong is a city known throughout the world for its fast pace and in our financial market , every second counts .  Take our stock market as an example .  Although its turnover has repeatedly set record highs of late , the automatic trading system of the Stock Exchange can still maintain the rate of completing automatic matching within two seconds and the clearing and settlement systems of the stock and futures markets as well as the banks still operate properly .  
Analysed by sector , the financing , insurance , real estate and business services sector recorded the fastest increase in average payroll per person engaged , by 14.1% in nominal terms or 7.5% in real terms in the third quarter of 1997 over a year earlier , as both the stock market and the property market reached a peak level in that quarter . 
" Of this , $ 16.2 billion comes from higher than expected receipts from stamp duty , reflecting the exceptional level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the first half of the financial year . 
( 5 ) to include in ranking liabilities any excess of a single stock collateral over 10% of aggregate collateral value to prevent these companies from building up excessive exposures to individual stock ;

" Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .  
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
August was an opportune time : turnover in the stock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level ; there was bad news as the Government announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative ; and rumours were flying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar .  
Our critics , both at home and abroad , have accused us of intervening with the aim simply of propping up the stock market ; of being too afraid to face the pain from the necessary interest rate volatility under a strict currency board system operating in difficult conditions ; even of trying to introduce a novel form of state ownership by acquiring a substantial interest in Hong Kong 's major corporations .  
Mr Tsang said the operations were open and transparent , and to avoid potential conflicts of interest , the Government had established the Exchange Fund Investment Limited - a company separate from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - to manage the stock portfolio acquired during the operations and to advise on a suitable strategy for the disposal of the stocks in an orderly manner without disrupting the market . 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Hong Kong economy operates with a relatively low gearing , as evidenced in the high savings rate , the extreme interest rate volatility translated into substantial falls in both stock and property prices and in extensive pain for the community as a whole , over and above the pain already being experienced through economic adjustment . 
The interest rate trend in the United States and the ensuing implications for its stock market and overall demand warrant close monitoring .  The economic recovery in Japan is yet to become more entrenched .  The process of financial reform and corporate restructuring in many of the crisis-hit East Asian economies will have to continue in order to sustain their growth in the time ahead .

He added , " The Hong Kong Central Library which will have a total area of 33,800 square metres and an ultimate stock of 2 million items of library materials will also be open to the public at the end of this year .

Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
These included the release of the first set of quarterly Gross National Product statistics for the first quarter of 1999 in December 1999 and the release of the first complete set of external direct investment statistics for 1998 in March 2000 , encompassing both the stock and flow of inward and outward direct investments .  
These changes included strengthening the monetary system to provide a greater buffer against attacks on the currency ; strengthening the banking system ; improving market regulations and stimulating the merger and demutualisation of the stock and futures exchanges ; closing loopholes in legislation ; and making the financial system far more open and transparent .  
They involve schemes making use of various tax planning tools , such as trusts , alienation of interest income , and artificial public issues of debentures in overseas stock exchanges , for the purpose of engineering artificial interest payment situations through circular flows of funds within companies in a group without any genuine external borrowing which requires real interest expenses , " the spokesman explained . 
( b ) In making an enquiry or considering the potential need for suspension of trading in a stock , the SFC and the SEHK will have regard to a number of factors , including percentage movements in price , whether upward or downward , and absolute changes in turnover volume ; movement of the whole market ; movement of stocks in the particular market sector ; recently announced corporate events or information , such as fund raising or business results ; and other market news , etc .  
According to the terms of reference , the committee will review the current domestic rent policy , having regard to the evolving profile of both tenants and rental housing stock under the HA . The committee will take into account the need to reflect tenants ' affordability while ensuring public housing subsidy is given in relation to need , the existing legislative provisions of having a 10% cap on the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) after rent adjustment , and the financial performance of the Authority 's rental business .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
An average of some 60,000 PRH units from the existing stock , together with new units to be completed , will be outsourced in each year up to 2003 / 04 .  One-third of contracts will be considered for outsourcing through restricted tender to Management Buy Out ( MBO ) companies where major shareholders are former Housing Department staff .  
Trading activity was weak in the first quarter , dampened by concern over deterioration in the external economic environment , sharp correction in the local stock market , and an ample supply of new flats coming on stream .  
( The Hang Seng Index fell further to 11 316 on 30 August , affected by lacklustre performance of the major stock markets overseas amidst a dim global economic scene . )  
The measures to dispose the overhung of HOS stock approved by Members were aimed at containing the vacant period of the units to about one year .  About 8,000 HOS / Private Sector Participation Scheme ( PSPS ) units , mainly from projects to be completed in 2002 / 03 , will be transferred into rental housing .  Priority would be given to allocate the extra rental housing units to overcrowded families in public housing and to applicants on the Waiting List to further reduce their waiting time .  
The coins will bear the standard Bauhinia design on the obverse side .  On the reverse side , there will be special commemorative designs , each depicting one of five traditional blessings or felicitations in Chinese : " May your wishes come true " , " May every year bring a surplus " , " Speedy success " , " Flowers bloom for prosperity " , and " May your stock turn over like a spinning wheel " .  
The gloomy global economic outlook amidst wary over a protracted US economic slow-down , and the successive waves of US corporate profits warnings , pushed down share prices worldwide .  The local stock market was likewise hit .  
Topics involved include merchandise retained imports , trade in services , gross domestic product by economic activity at constant prices , international investment position , education , health and stock transactions .  
While movements in the US stock market continued to exert a heavy influence on the local stock market , the lacklustre corporate performance and uncertain business outlook also posed a drag .  
The paper estimated that some 15-25% of the total outstanding Hong Kong dollar stock ( around HK $ 15-25 billion ) was held outside of Hong Kong . Most of it was held in the southern parts of Mainland China , where the demand for Hong Kong dollars had grown in recent years , despite a stable renminbi .  
On the basis of these factors as well as an estimated annual supply of over 10,000 refurbished flats from the existing public rental housing stock , we are confident that we can maintain the average waiting time at around three years with an annual production of over 20,000 public rental housing flats in the next few years .  
In fact , although the spotlight tends , quite understandably , to be on newsworthy issues - bank rescues , intervention in the stock market , the latest Exchange Fund results , the " alarming " strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar - much of the work of any central bank has to be focused on the longer term , on the implementation of sustainable , consistent , dependable policies on a horizon that lies well beyond the daily concerns of most of us .

As his techniques improved , his stock was sold out only hours after it had been taken out of the ovens . Now aged 72 , Kuo gives the reasons for his success : " If you run a reliable business which produces pastries and other snacks suited to the public taste , your reputation will spread far and wide by word of mouth .

The venture capitalist on the other hand is always looking for new opportunities and will be willing to part with a company that is standing on it 's own financial feet . To sell interest in a commercial concern takes an organized market , Taiwan is also in the process of developing a reliable and stable stock market to reach this end .  
With a viable stock market the average citizen can also participate in the development of the economy . Venture capital companies are a nascent industry in Taiwan and there are disagreements as to where to go and how fast to get there . There are regulations limiting venture capital to 15% of the total capitalization of any one company .

Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
A new peak is only reached after years of economic growth when the shares of quoted companies have really reached that value ; or else , as in the case of Japan this last time , when share prices are sustained by an inflow of hot money on the international market . " Between its initial establishment and reaching full maturity , any stock market must pass through the phases of manipulation and market fragility , " Frank Yeh observes on the basis of the normal market development model .  
Premier Hau Pei-tsun has stated that the government wants to ensure a healthy stock market , not rescue it . The Ministry of Finance has also firmly turned down suggestions from certain deputies and businessmen to lower the securities transaction tax so as to stimulate a recovery in share prices . Instead , regulations are being revised to encourage financially sound companies to list their shares on the market and to allow foreign institutions to enter the market , as a viable means of nudging the local stock market towards full maturity .  
So when the stock prices fell , it was either time to tighten the belt or capital flows dried up altogether . For small and medium enterprises , in August stock certificates were redeemed at a rate of 4.6 per thousand . The balance sheet performance of most companies on the market was also not hopeful : from the reports of the first half of the year , of the 192 companies on the board , 33 reported losses outright .  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
" Chinese food is world famous for its fine flavor , and modernizing traditional cuisine is something we can work toward , " says Jamin Wang , who feels that frozen food is a trend of the times . If Chinese people , who hold great stock in the " culture of eating , " can add a Chinese touch to the trend , then maybe frozen food wo n't just be quick and convenient anymore , but delicious ! ( Wei Hung-chin / photos by Diago Chiu / tr . by Peter Eberly )  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
A : Naturally , reports on the dark side of specific cases are more newsworthy . For example , anytime we have a press conference , we always send notices to reporters three days in advance . But news about our seminar on a lobbying law and improper back-door influence got only a small amount of space in the papers , whereas the Feng An stock case was played up by the media for four days straight , from the time they got the notices to the press conference .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
Apart from some so-called " armorial porcelain " especially decorated with family crests , what is most interesting is the various kinds of European themes used : for instance , plates bearing humorous pictures to do with current events , like the Rotterdam riot , British elections , and the collapse of the Amsterdam stock market ; there were also biblical and mythological scenes .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Following the announcement that British researchers working for PPL Therapeutics had cloned a sheep and the marketing of Viagra by the Swedish firm Pfizer , the stock price of Entremed , a previously unknown pharmaceutical firm , recently tripled in one day after it announced that it had developed a new anti-cancer drug . Thought to have high growth potential , biotechnology stocks have become star performers .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
Nonetheless , compared with other Asian countries , Taiwanese people 's sense of their own good fortune is subdued . Recently the media have frequently pinpointed rising " discomfort indicators , " focusing on unemployment , the departure of industry overseas , falling stock prices and an adverse economic outlook , so that people are dogged by anxieties .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Brougham was born in Seattle to a Christian family of German stock and was one of nine children . When she was 11 years old , she attended a summer camp at which Chi Chih-wen , an evangelical minister from China , spoke about his ancient land . On hearing Chi 's lecture , Brougham decided that when she grew up , she was going to go to China as a missionary .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Wu explains that the high-tech industry peaked in 1999 going into 2001 , but after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 , the global economy went into a deep recession . To make matters worse , the dot-com bubble burst in the United States , investors suffered loss after loss in the stock market , consumer spending fell , and prices continued to decline , resulting in what economists call a deflationary economy .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
As soon as the music stopped , the actors instantly went stock still , their suddenly motionless poses designed the better to exaggerate their formidable power . Wu applied this same imagery to the beards on the men in his sculpture to give viewers the feeling that the characters had just brought their heads to a sudden halt in the middle of a violent motion .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
" Back in the early days , " recalls Lee , " Eslite found itself stuck with huge numbers of foreign-language books in stock . Over time , we refined our business model and learned what we needed to order . We became selective and stopped having to dump books to clear our inventory . "

In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .

The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
Many serious technical problems have been noted in the use of physical infrastructure , such as outdated vehicles and rolling stock , lack of repair facilities , lack of financial means to buy new vehicles , problems of break gauge , bogie change and axle load on railroads , and problems of CIS brake systems and automatic coupling ( SA-3 ) , which are not compatible with the wagons and trains of non-CIS countries .

The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .

Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
Although there have been no major changes to the distribution system , in view of the comparatively large stock of infant formula built up through the arrival of the whole allocation under the first phase of implementation of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) within a space of 10 weeks , the Government of Iraq announced in mid-May that the parents of children born after May 1997 would be required to accept the infant formula , soap and detergent for their children rather than choose to receive adult rations .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Nevertheless , it seems to the Committee that it might be helpful for the working group to take stock of recent developments and to reassess its approach in light of these changing circumstances , with a view to providing a very valuable opportunity for the international community to ensure that the overall approach which is emerging is optimal .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
Nor is it necessarily desirable to accelerate the process of freeing controlled prices ( it is well known and accepted that public and semi-public housing rents are heavily subsidized in the transition economies and that a move to more economic levels is necessary for an improvement in the housing stock , but this can not be done abruptly as the subsidies are an important part of the social safety net in these countries ) .  
However , it is possible to ( i ) take stock of recent trends relevant to this issue , ( ii ) identify some key issues requiring immediate international attention , and ( iii ) outline possible priority areas for future work on the relationship between electronic commerce , globalization and development .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .

The booming stock markets have been closely interrelated with rapid ICT innovations and the strong performance of the real economy , yielding a virtuous circle .  
One downside risk , possibly the worst , is that of a hard landing for the United States , either because of a stock market crash , which would reduce the wealth of economic actors , or because the authorities reacted to a sign of inflationary pressures by tightening monetary policy so sharply as to produce a decline rather than a moderate deceleration of output growth .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
The objectives were twofold : to collect comprehensive information on the stock of cross-border equities and long-term debt securities for use in the compilation or improvement of international investment position statistics ; and to allow the bilateral exchange of comparable data , in order to improve estimates of non-resident holdings of portfolio liabilities , as well as associated capital flows and investment income data .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .

However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .

Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
In the agricultural new high level technology development and model zone of Zibo City in the Zhangdian District , plan to establish a agricultural scientific research training institute , a breeding area for improved agricultural varieties , an organic vegetable area , a quality orchard , the fine stock breeding farm , etc .  
Joining the WTO will help China to import in appropriate amounts agricultural staple products for which land resources are the main production element and in which China lacks relative advantage , and also to export labor-intensive agricultural products such as fruit , vegetables , and animal and aquatic products .

Annette Lu is a so-called master of law , but unexpectedly she knows nothing about the history and geography of her own nation .  She has ignored logic , reasoning and legal principles , and wantonly spread splittist ideas .

The Bush camp 's sinister tactics infuriated the Clinton administration .

However , their timing was unfortunately not right .  The stock market on the Wall Street was dropping precipitously , resulting in less money left in American people 's pockets .  The defense by Sperling and others appeared powerless in the face of Bush 's veiled attack .  This has created enmity between the two sides .  
Discussing the current work of taking stock of and straightening out " state investments , " Dai Xianglong revealed that in the past one or two years the central bank has held frequent consultations with local governments on the question of straightening out trust and investment companies , because the great majority of these companies , apart from a few , are the equity controlling or total investment companies of the local governments .

According to the technical norms of market regulatory systems that stock markets have applied to trace irregular trading activities , the China Security Regulatory Commission conducted quantitative analyses in a specific period of time and found that this corporation had engaged in such irregular business more than 10,000 times .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .

Due to the perverse behavior of the Chen Shui-bian government over the past year , the Taiwan stock market has weakened , the foreign exchange market is depressed , and industry and commerce face unprecedented difficulties , on top of which cross-strait relations are deadlocked and have retrogressed rather than advancing .  Industrial confidence on the island has collapsed and business has been forced to invest abroad for the sake of its existence .  
Recently , while the US stock market was falling again and again , Taiwan 's stock market did not follow suit and even slightly rose .  The key for this lay in the existence of the mainland conceptual stocks formed by the Taiwan businessmen 's investment in the mainland , the opening of B shares on the mainland stock market , and the booming real estate market on the mainland side .  All these factors effectively played a role in supporting Taiwan 's stock market .

A series of erroneous policies , such as the sudden announcements on the termination , and then the resumption of the construction of the fourth nuclear plant and the use of large sums from the " national stabilization fund " to support the stock market in order to fulfill political promises , have wasted energy , resulting in the loss of hope for Taiwan in the next decade .

What is worse , in so doing , major shareholders have seriously violated the principle of " being open , fair , and impartial , " namely , a principle governing the stock market , and have directly encroached upon small and medium-sized investors ' legitimate rights and interests as well .  
Now that the CSCC has decided to place on file for investigation and prosecution both the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . and the people involved in its irregularities , circulating a notice criticizing the relevant law-violation and rule-violation behaviors , this has signaled a major move made by China 's securities control authorities aimed at restructuring listed companies in terms of management , and has demonstrated China 's securities control authorities ' firm resolve in ruthlessly cracking down on irregularities in the stock market as well .  
Both markets posted an average gain of more than nine percent at the close , with the total volume of transaction almost touching 50 billion .  This was typical of a market situation where stock prices and transaction volumes go up hand in hand .

As the state 's stock of grain was doubled and redoubled between 1995 and 1999 , and the grain stored in peasant households exceeded 500 kg per capita during the same period , equivalent to two years ' quantity for personal consumption , we can believe that the total net import volume of 30.19 million tonnes in 1995 and 1996 was not a result of real demand due to domestic grain shortage .  
That included a net savings deposit drop for May of 34.1 billion yuan , which was due mainly to the brisk stock market and hot-selling treasury bonds converting some savings into investment , and the increased individual consumption for the " 1 May " holiday also cutting into some savings .

These situations have to do with the current chaotic and uncertain cross-strait situation .  
Previously , some individual investors felt they were being deceived by the speculation in reorganized stock market assets .  Usually when the substantive conditions of stocks was made public , the stock prices of the reorganized stocks had risen due to speculation .  The investment value became overdrawn .

The Weighted Index has fallen below the psychological level of 8,000 points , and the daily stock turnover has kept shrinking , once even registering only 50.2 billion New Taiwan dollars , a depressing sight .  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .

After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
The article pointed out : Since Taiwan 's " premier " has been changed recently , the political situation of the island has been shaky and unstable .  The stock market has slumped , grumbling by the people is heard everywhere , and voices of condemning the leadership of the Taiwan authorities and the Democratic Progressive Party are lingering on incessantly .  
The opposition parties believe that Taiwan 's leader puts undue emphasis on ideology , defies public opinion , undermines established systems , and tramples on the consultation and mutual trust mechanism between the ruling and opposition parties .  They believe that as a result of this , the economy is depressed , the unemployment rate is rising , the stock market is dropping , and the people 's wealth is sharply diminishing .  
Because of well-developed IT infrastructure and the appearance of many intelligent buildings and wired communities and because net life and information-based consumption are accessible to ordinary citizens , more and more people can experience the virtues of distance learning , distance medical care , digital library , and shopping , house search , stock trading , and sightseeing on cyberspace .  
Their sideline and disadvantageous businesses will be diverted elsewhere so that the operating costs will be substantially reduced , the transfer and use of funds will be more effective , and the core businesses can achieve more rapid development .  As regards some companies that have been listed in the stock markets , their assets will be sold subject to the approval of the shareholders ' meetings and in accordance with the practices prevailing in Hong Kong .  
Economically , stock prices have fallen sharply , the real estate market is sluggish , many traditional industries have totally moved out of the island , and a financial storm is looming ahead .  The economy has continued to decline , and with the end of the year drawing near , enterprises are meeting with difficulties in settling their debts , while there is a sharp rise in the number of jobless people .  Because of this , the local people have no confidence in Taiwan 's future .

These imbalances may add to the gravity of problems when the country 's economic growth is slowing down .  
It has been pointed out that based on evidence it had gathered over the years , the Investigation Bureau has found out that the customary tactics employed by the mainland are to put Chinese investment into foreign companies based in our country , have a hand in Taiwan 's stock market , and spread rumors in the market in an attempt to cause severe damage to our stock market and our economy .  
The backward steps of Taiwan 's authorities have caused relations across the Strait to constantly worsen , and have led to disorder and loss of confidence on the island .  As a result , investment has stagnated , the economy has gone into a recession , there has been a huge outflow of capital and human resources , and the stock market has plummeted to a nearly five-year low , with a closing figure yesterday of 4721 points .  Things are tight all over , and the unemployment rate is reaching a 15-year record high .

The animal farming industry should quicken the pace of improving stock breeds and structural adjustments , actively develop the fodder industry and the refined and in-depth processing of animal products , and greatly advance the industrial operation .

" Given that shell resources for listed companies were still very precious and the withdrawal of listed companies from the stock market would have a bearing on social stability , the management and local governments " repeatedly put up with " these trash stocks without mercilessly delisting them and adopted a mild attitude toward chronically loss-making companies .  
China Securities Regulatory Commission has of late promulgated " Measures for Listed Companies To Suspend or Terminate Listing on a Stock Market , " which has spelled out detailed regulations for listed companies with outstanding losses for three years in a row , to suspend , resume , or terminate listing on a stock market .

In the past year , Taiwan 's economy has remained in the doldrums and the stock market has fallen sharply , and there has been an outflow of capital and boisterous complaints by the people .  It looks like there is no way out for Taiwan independence .  
Hong Kong is a city known throughout the world for its fast pace and in our financial market , every second counts .  Take our stock market as an example .

" Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .

The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
August was an opportune time : turnover in the stock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level ; there was bad news as the Government announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative ; and rumours were flying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar .  
Our critics , both at home and abroad , have accused us of intervening with the aim simply of propping up the stock market ; of being too afraid to face the pain from the necessary interest rate volatility under a strict currency board system operating in difficult conditions ; even of trying to introduce a novel form of state ownership by acquiring a substantial interest in Hong Kong 's major corporations .

Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .

This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
An average of some 60,000 PRH units from the existing stock , together with new units to be completed , will be outsourced in each year up to 2003 / 04 .

The gloomy global economic outlook amidst wary over a protracted US economic slow-down , and the successive waves of US corporate profits warnings , pushed down share prices worldwide .  The local stock market was likewise hit .

The paper estimated that some 15-25% of the total outstanding Hong Kong dollar stock ( around HK $ 15-25 billion ) was held outside of Hong Kong . Most of it was held in the southern parts of Mainland China , where the demand for Hong Kong dollars had grown in recent years , despite a stable renminbi .

With a viable stock market the average citizen can also participate in the development of the economy . Venture capital companies are a nascent industry in Taiwan and there are disagreements as to where to go and how fast to get there . There are regulations limiting venture capital to 15% of the total capitalization of any one company .

Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
Under principles of " internationalization and liberalization " the system should be harmonized with those of our major trading partners . Consideration should be given to eliminating the exemption for military personnel and teachers as well as unreasonable erosions of the tax base ( like leaving out interest income up to 360,000 NT dollars or from stock trading ) , simplifying tax brackets , lowering the highest rates , and looking into the tax reporting method ; these are all concrete proposals to make a thorough reform of the tax system .  
Numerous disorderly phenomena have cropped up , such as a deterioration in public safety caused by the spread of guns . The problem of parliamentary turnover , polarization of views on the issue of Taiwan independence vs . reunification with China , real estate and stock speculation , shortcomings in social welfare , and labor and environmental problems all need to be addressed .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
A new peak is only reached after years of economic growth when the shares of quoted companies have really reached that value ; or else , as in the case of Japan this last time , when share prices are sustained by an inflow of hot money on the international market . " Between its initial establishment and reaching full maturity , any stock market must pass through the phases of manipulation and market fragility , " Frank Yeh observes on the basis of the normal market development model .  
Premier Hau Pei-tsun has stated that the government wants to ensure a healthy stock market , not rescue it . The Ministry of Finance has also firmly turned down suggestions from certain deputies and businessmen to lower the securities transaction tax so as to stimulate a recovery in share prices . Instead , regulations are being revised to encourage financially sound companies to list their shares on the market and to allow foreign institutions to enter the market , as a viable means of nudging the local stock market towards full maturity .  
So when the stock prices fell , it was either time to tighten the belt or capital flows dried up altogether . For small and medium enterprises , in August stock certificates were redeemed at a rate of 4.6 per thousand . The balance sheet performance of most companies on the market was also not hopeful : from the reports of the first half of the year , of the 192 companies on the board , 33 reported losses outright .  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
And hot money , one of the two main factors leading to the disaster of speculative fever ( along with surplus money in circulation ) , has come back to Taiwan . People are just waiting for the opportunity to have their golden dreams again by taking advantage of currency exchange , the stock market and real estate .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
" Chinese food is world famous for its fine flavor , and modernizing traditional cuisine is something we can work toward , " says Jamin Wang , who feels that frozen food is a trend of the times . If Chinese people , who hold great stock in the " culture of eating , " can add a Chinese touch to the trend , then maybe frozen food wo n't just be quick and convenient anymore , but delicious ! ( Wei Hung-chin / photos by Diago Chiu / tr . by Peter Eberly )  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
A : Naturally , reports on the dark side of specific cases are more newsworthy . For example , anytime we have a press conference , we always send notices to reporters three days in advance . But news about our seminar on a lobbying law and improper back-door influence got only a small amount of space in the papers , whereas the Feng An stock case was played up by the media for four days straight , from the time they got the notices to the press conference .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
Apart from some so-called " armorial porcelain " especially decorated with family crests , what is most interesting is the various kinds of European themes used : for instance , plates bearing humorous pictures to do with current events , like the Rotterdam riot , British elections , and the collapse of the Amsterdam stock market ; there were also biblical and mythological scenes .  
Given the current intense anti-drug efforts and heavy sentences , it is difficult to move drugs within Taiwan , and the price of heroin has increased as supply has been unable to keep up with demand . Depending upon how much major suppliers have in stock , one kilo can be sold for NT $ 15 million .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
Following the announcement that British researchers working for PPL Therapeutics had cloned a sheep and the marketing of Viagra by the Swedish firm Pfizer , the stock price of Entremed , a previously unknown pharmaceutical firm , recently tripled in one day after it announced that it had developed a new anti-cancer drug . Thought to have high growth potential , biotechnology stocks have become star performers .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
Twenty-eight-year-old Li Ching-yu went to senior high school and university in Canada , and graduated in economics . After he took over his father 's business four years ago , he introduced modern management methods . He not only redecorated and enlarged the premises , set up a limited company and instituted a profit sharing and stock ownership scheme for employees , but recently also embarked on an expansion plan calling for opening new branches , like a home-grown McDonald 's .  
Due to the increased tension across the Taiwan Strait and incessant rumors of elevating levels of military alert , within five days Taiwan 's stock market shed more than a thousand points . On July 16 alone it plummeted 506 points , with total market value shrinking by more than NT $ 1.5 trillion . To prop up the market , the Ministry of Finance forced four major government-related funds-the postal savings fund , labor pension fund , labor insurance fund and civil service pension fund-to buy stock .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
The most important of these are duck blood and tofu , popularly known as " red and white tofu " because the cakes of cooked duck blood have a similar texture to tofu . These must be fresh and clean , firm on the outside but tender on the inside , and the tofu in particular should be slab tofu made in the traditional way , because it absorbs the soup , so that when one bites into it the hot , spicy , flavorsome stock immediately gushes out , filling one 's mouth .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs . Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . A case in point : Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look . They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5% of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors . In 1999 turnover was 288% ( that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market ) , which , though considerably down from nearly 600% ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange . Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
Nonetheless , compared with other Asian countries , Taiwanese people 's sense of their own good fortune is subdued . Recently the media have frequently pinpointed rising " discomfort indicators , " focusing on unemployment , the departure of industry overseas , falling stock prices and an adverse economic outlook , so that people are dogged by anxieties .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
Brougham was born in Seattle to a Christian family of German stock and was one of nine children . When she was 11 years old , she attended a summer camp at which Chi Chih-wen , an evangelical minister from China , spoke about his ancient land . On hearing Chi 's lecture , Brougham decided that when she grew up , she was going to go to China as a missionary .  
Chen called on DPP party officials and public office holders to withdraw from management of electronic media , and he also stated that the government would abandon all management rights in those media outlets in which it holds stock . Moreover , he asked the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan to give priority to amending the laws governing radio and TV-especially those provisions that would exclude government , political parties , and the military from control over the media-saying that it is their duty to complete the amending process in this legislative session .  
Wu explains that the high-tech industry peaked in 1999 going into 2001 , but after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 , the global economy went into a deep recession . To make matters worse , the dot-com bubble burst in the United States , investors suffered loss after loss in the stock market , consumer spending fell , and prices continued to decline , resulting in what economists call a deflationary economy .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
As soon as the music stopped , the actors instantly went stock still , their suddenly motionless poses designed the better to exaggerate their formidable power . Wu applied this same imagery to the beards on the men in his sculpture to give viewers the feeling that the characters had just brought their heads to a sudden halt in the middle of a violent motion .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
" Back in the early days , " recalls Lee , " Eslite found itself stuck with huge numbers of foreign-language books in stock . Over time , we refined our business model and learned what we needed to order . We became selective and stopped having to dump books to clear our inventory . "  
rong said that in tandem with the development of the enterprises ' joint stock transformation , a major part of china 's efforts to establish the socialist market economic system , more and more chinese enterprises will be listed on overseas bourses  
In the medium term , this decline in the construction sector can be expected to be reversed given the potential for industrial restructuring , the need for extensive infrastructure investment , and the social pressures for a renewal of the housing stock .  
The total stock of external debt in the least developed countries represented nearly three quarters of their combined gross domestic product .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
In 1993 , the total stock of external debt ( measured at current prices and exchange rates ) rose by 5 per cent - much less than gross domestic product ( GDP ) - to $ 1,630-billion , with much of this attributable to growth of debt stocks in Asia as well as to valuation effects .  
It is estimated that a provision of $ 865,700 , reflecting growth of $ 41,000 , would be required for the acquisition of professional radio and television reference books and materials , and public information supplies such as film , raw stock , audio and video tapes and cassettes , photographic film , paper and chemicals and other miscellaneous materials required for radio and visual productions and supplies for the operation of the typesetting system .  
We are taking stock of negative , devastating and genocide effects of sanctions on the health of the people of Yugoslavia and demonstrate in an expert way , corroborated by arguments , to what extent the sanctions have held us back in the implementation of the health care of the population , how much damage , pain and evil was inflicted and how many innocent lives were cut off as a result .  
The Paris Club granted Poland a 50 per cent reduction in the entire stock of bilateral debt ( or an equivalent reduction in the scheduled debt service calculated on the basis of net present value ) , phased over several years . 
States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method ( e.g . , each individual tow for trawl , each set for long-line and purse-seine , each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll ) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment ;

Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
Many serious technical problems have been noted in the use of physical infrastructure , such as outdated vehicles and rolling stock , lack of repair facilities , lack of financial means to buy new vehicles , problems of break gauge , bogie change and axle load on railroads , and problems of CIS brake systems and automatic coupling ( SA-3 ) , which are not compatible with the wagons and trains of non-CIS countries .  
Important objectives for further development of global and regional legal regimes and management policies would be the re-establishment of a balance between fishing efforts and fishing yields , proper enforcement of agreed conservation measures , the regulation and control of all catches ( including those from the high seas ) and the offsetting of all catches ( including discards ) against the determined quotas for each stock .  
The vast majority of the Russian-speaking population of Latvia , like that of Estonia , was initially deprived of citizenship , and then of the real possibility of obtaining it , and thus is prevented from participating in elections , deprived of the right to purchase land , and subjected to considerable limitations on the rights to privatize and to establish joint stock companies , as well as to occupy posts in the public administration .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
The Committee approved , on the basis of suggestions from the States concerned , a strictly limited number of road and rail border crossing points , which henceforth represented the exclusive transit points for passage of freight and rolling stock into and out of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( press releases SC / 5615 and SC / 5646 ) , monitored by national authorities in cooperation with the SAMs .  
The economic crisis , on the one hand , and the identity crisis , on the other , are aggravated by the claims of people of French stock to ascendency over naturalized French citizens and immigrants ; hence the reference to the theme of national preference , with its xenophobic and even racist content , in political speeches .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,

From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
The issues to be discussed at the conference are set out in table 4 , and include methods for estimating capital stock , including the perpetual inventory method and direct survey methods ; concepts of capital for different purposes , such as balance sheets and productivity analysis ; issues for national balance sheets ; and extensions of the 1993 SNA capital boundary , such as computer software , mineral exploration and non-weapon military equipment .

The Conference welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and hoped that it would be reinforced by additional bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce the debt stock of all African countries .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from savings attributable to lower deployment of civilian and military personnel , availability of rent-free premises and accommodation , lower requirements for transport and communication spare parts than earlier estimated owing to the implementation of the wet lease and self-sustainment arrangements under the new reimbursement procedures for contingent-owned equipment and the continued availability of supplies from existing UNPF stock .

By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
If we are to be occupied , and not only preoccupied , with reform , let us reject , as incompatible with this Organization , the corporate and transnational approach promoted by some of the main United Nations contributors , as if this building were a stock exchange and the just desires of the peoples were mere merchandise .  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
On the one hand , it was intended to enable people of the Comoros , of all leanings and sensibilities alike , to take stock of their post-colonial history a history marked by multifaceted tragedies in a frank and calm debate with the assistance of the international community .  
Further efforts are also required to reduce the debt service and debt stock , including multilateral debt , of the highly indebted least developed and other low-income countries , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
The Committee considered that further efforts were required to reduce the debt service and debt stock of the highly indebted least developed countries , including multilateral debt , allowing resources to be focused on development and promoting access to international capital markets .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from delays in the deployment of civilian personnel , reduced rental requirements related to the deployment of the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) , the cost of the use of government-provided helicopters based on actual use rather than commercially provided helicopters and the availability of some equipment and supplies from surplus stock .  
Although there have been no major changes to the distribution system , in view of the comparatively large stock of infant formula built up through the arrival of the whole allocation under the first phase of implementation of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) within a space of 10 weeks , the Government of Iraq announced in mid-May that the parents of children born after May 1997 would be required to accept the infant formula , soap and detergent for their children rather than choose to receive adult rations .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Nevertheless , it seems to the Committee that it might be helpful for the working group to take stock of recent developments and to reassess its approach in light of these changing circumstances , with a view to providing a very valuable opportunity for the international community to ensure that the overall approach which is emerging is optimal .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
Nor is it necessarily desirable to accelerate the process of freeing controlled prices ( it is well known and accepted that public and semi-public housing rents are heavily subsidized in the transition economies and that a move to more economic levels is necessary for an improvement in the housing stock , but this can not be done abruptly as the subsidies are an important part of the social safety net in these countries ) .  
However , it is possible to ( i ) take stock of recent trends relevant to this issue , ( ii ) identify some key issues requiring immediate international attention , and ( iii ) outline possible priority areas for future work on the relationship between electronic commerce , globalization and development .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
During 1995-1999 , stock markets in the United States , as measured by the performance of the Standard and Poors 500 index ( the S &amp; amp ; P 500 ) deflated by the consumer price index ( CPI ) , registered an average annual real return of 24 per cent , double the average over the last century .  
The booming stock markets have been closely interrelated with rapid ICT innovations and the strong performance of the real economy , yielding a virtuous circle .  
One downside risk , possibly the worst , is that of a hard landing for the United States , either because of a stock market crash , which would reduce the wealth of economic actors , or because the authorities reacted to a sign of inflationary pressures by tightening monetary policy so sharply as to produce a decline rather than a moderate deceleration of output growth .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
In that context , and notwithstanding the view of some members that the overall level of debt itself constituted a significant burden , the Committee agreed that , should the adjustment be retained , it should be based on actual principal repayments ( what has become known as the debt flow approach ) rather than on an estimate of the repayment of total debt stocks ( what has become known as the debt stock approach ) .  
The objectives were twofold : to collect comprehensive information on the stock of cross-border equities and long-term debt securities for use in the compilation or improvement of international investment position statistics ; and to allow the bilateral exchange of comparable data , in order to improve estimates of non-resident holdings of portfolio liabilities , as well as associated capital flows and investment income data .  
It was considered to have been an important occasion for taking stock of legal and regulatory developments at the national and international level , enabling experts to give consideration to all legal aspects of electronic commerce , including their impact , problem areas and possible solutions .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Further improvement of the international debt strategy should be in line with the once and for all approach designed to reduce the overall stock of debt of the indebted countries and should include the adoption of an integrated approach to all types of indebtedness , including multilateral , bilateral and commercial debt .  
The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .  
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
The Conference had taken stock of developments in space science and applications , explored new areas of cooperation , considered the changing economic and political environment which offered new opportunities for international cooperation and studied the constraints and issues faced by developing countries in building national capacities to benefit from space technology as well as ways to involve the private sector more closely in the process .  
An international cooperative programme on integrated landuse planning and management should begin by taking stock of existing knowledge and local , national and international experience in a more systematic and detailed manner .  
The current session of the First Committee is being held at a crucial period , when the approaching new millennium compels us to take stock of what we have achieved and to work out reliable guidelines for international relations in the future .  
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Regarding the economic situation in Asia one panellist expressed the view that pessimism was exaggerated despite the regions dependence on exports of electronic goods , a still incomplete process of banking and corporate restructuring , and a decline in the stock markets steeper than in most developed countries .  
Strengthened public confidence and awareness : the strengthening of regulatory institutions , protection of property rights through the stock markets , judicial enforcement of private contracts and transparent and internationally accepted accounting procedures and legal standards to promote investor confidence ;
