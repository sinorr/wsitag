As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1995 and the results of its operations for the year then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
Turkey and the pseudo-state , taking advantage of a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots , proceeded a few weeks ago , with the active involvement of the extremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves , to implement a meticulously prepared plan which was crowned by the murder in cold blood of two young Cypriots and the injuries sustained by many others , United Nations peacekeepers included .  
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;

Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
At its third annual session , the Subcommittee established an initial set of 12 themes , of which 5-8 would be prepared in a first round , to be completed prior to the convening of the thirty-ninth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs .

In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .

A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
In its decision 96 / 2 , entitled " UNICEF emergency services : mission and strategies " , the Executive Board urged UNICEF , in close cooperation with the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and other relevant agencies and organizations of the United Nations system , to facilitate the implementation of Economic and Social Council decision 1995 / 56 , inter alia , through coordinated reporting to the 1996 substantive session of the Council and identified subjects of the operational papers to be prepared during 1996-1997 .

Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
For the purpose of determining assessment rates , the " clean slate " approach reflected the capacity of countries to pay , although Ukraine was prepared to support the existing system , in which estimates of national income would continue to be adjusted in accordance with factors determined by the General Assembly ; however , in the next scale , the cumulative effect of such adjustments should be minimal in relation to the capacity to pay of Member States .  
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
His delegation welcomed the fact that 155 out of 193 countries had already prepared national programmes of action , either in final or draft form ; the national programmes of action should be based on regional and local realities , such as historical and cultural factors and differing levels of development and capacity , in order to enhance the possibilities of achieving the targeted goals . 
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
As soon as practicable , after an issue has been included in the work programme , a structured and detailed design plan for the inspection , evaluation or investigation and a detailed plan for scheduling activities , including the most effective and timely means of gathering the information required , is prepared by the responsible Inspector ( s ) , assisted by the Executive Secretary and designated research staff .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
Requested that a matrix be prepared matching the available forest valuation methods and data set required for the evaluation of goods and services , in particular those goods and services that are not traded in the market place , at the local , national , regional and international levels ; ( c ) Encouraged [ Governments ] [ countries ] , international agencies and relevant institutions to promote research to further develop forest valuation methodologies in particular those related to degradation and deforestation and criteria and indicators .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
For example , the Board was pleased to see that UNITAR had prepared detailed plans for the programmes on pollutant release and transfer registers and on national action plans , which provided clearly defined objectives , expected outputs and milestones and set out the respective responsibilities of UNITAR and participating countries .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial period then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority . 
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
To improve coordination of public information activities , JUNIC decided to establish an open-ended working group based in New York to meet on a monthly or bi-monthly basis in the inter-sessional period and discuss matters of mutual concern , and also to revive the bi-monthly JUNIC Information Bulletin , prepared by the JUNIC secretariat and distributed electronically to the members of JUNIC and to directors of information of bilateral development agencies , as a means of keeping informed and better coordinating the preparation of information products and activities .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
In the light of various publications in the media and elsewhere concerning Israel 's interrogation policies and practices , I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the attached paper * on the subject ( prepared by the Ministry of Justice ) distributed as an official document of the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , before its opening on 10 March 1997 . 
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
Detailed and specific projects for each of the eight countries , focused on a combination of training and supportive measures to strengthen supply capabilities based on the needs already identified , have been prepared for each country and currently await formal approval from the country authorities concerned .  
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
VIII . 168 .  With regard to the methodology for apportionment of medical costs , the Advisory Committee was informed that this provides for the share of each participating organization to be determined on the basis of statistics prepared by the Joint Medical Service on the actual usage of the Service by the different organizations broken down by items such as medical exams , x-rays and laboratory tests , vaccinations and nursing care and administrative work .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
Success criteria will be measured in terms of the number and quality of business plans prepared and implemented , an increase in the number of viable and profitable small - and medium-scale enterprises and people employed , and a continuous rise in the levels of investments recorded .  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
In the report on this subject prepared two years ago for the Commission for Social Development , it was emphasized that , in a period of rapid change , it was particularly difficult to identify significant trends and distinguish transient from lasting changes affecting society .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .

The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
In addition , the documents were prepared on the following subjects : protection aspects of UNHCR activities on behalf of internally displaced persons ; comprehensive and regional approaches to refugee problems ; recommendations of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) / UNHCR Symposium on Refugees and forced Population Displacements in Africa ; and the scope of international protection in mass influx ; as well as a note on current UNHCR activities on behalf of stateless persons .  
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
In its decision 96 / 2 , entitled " UNICEF emergency services : mission and strategies " , the Executive Board urged UNICEF , in close cooperation with the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and other relevant agencies and organizations of the United Nations system , to facilitate the implementation of Economic and Social Council decision 1995 / 56 , inter alia , through coordinated reporting to the 1996 substantive session of the Council and identified subjects of the operational papers to be prepared during 1996-1997 .  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
The General Manager called the vendors , determined the quantities of merchandise to be ordered , authorized and approved purchases , received and stocked the delivered merchandise ( and even certified its receipt in several cases ) , and then prepared and signed the disbursement voucher for payment .  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements , prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management , shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
For the purpose of determining assessment rates , the " clean slate " approach reflected the capacity of countries to pay , although Ukraine was prepared to support the existing system , in which estimates of national income would continue to be adjusted in accordance with factors determined by the General Assembly ; however , in the next scale , the cumulative effect of such adjustments should be minimal in relation to the capacity to pay of Member States .  
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
His delegation welcomed the fact that 155 out of 193 countries had already prepared national programmes of action , either in final or draft form ; the national programmes of action should be based on regional and local realities , such as historical and cultural factors and differing levels of development and capacity , in order to enhance the possibilities of achieving the targeted goals . 
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
As soon as practicable , after an issue has been included in the work programme , a structured and detailed design plan for the inspection , evaluation or investigation and a detailed plan for scheduling activities , including the most effective and timely means of gathering the information required , is prepared by the responsible Inspector ( s ) , assisted by the Executive Secretary and designated research staff .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
In this context , he felt sure that delegations had come to the current session of the Board not to fulfil routine representational formalities but , stimulated and motivated by the in-depth and solid analytical reports prepared by the secretariat , to hold a serious dialogue on issues that were of primary concern to their policy-makers .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
Requested that a matrix be prepared matching the available forest valuation methods and data set required for the evaluation of goods and services , in particular those goods and services that are not traded in the market place , at the local , national , regional and international levels ; ( c ) Encouraged [ Governments ] [ countries ] , international agencies and relevant institutions to promote research to further develop forest valuation methodologies in particular those related to degradation and deforestation and criteria and indicators .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
For example , the Board was pleased to see that UNITAR had prepared detailed plans for the programmes on pollutant release and transfer registers and on national action plans , which provided clearly defined objectives , expected outputs and milestones and set out the respective responsibilities of UNITAR and participating countries .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial period then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority . 
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
To improve coordination of public information activities , JUNIC decided to establish an open-ended working group based in New York to meet on a monthly or bi-monthly basis in the inter-sessional period and discuss matters of mutual concern , and also to revive the bi-monthly JUNIC Information Bulletin , prepared by the JUNIC secretariat and distributed electronically to the members of JUNIC and to directors of information of bilateral development agencies , as a means of keeping informed and better coordinating the preparation of information products and activities .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
In the light of various publications in the media and elsewhere concerning Israel 's interrogation policies and practices , I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the attached paper * on the subject ( prepared by the Ministry of Justice ) distributed as an official document of the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , before its opening on 10 March 1997 . 
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
While existing rules prepared by organizations such as the Comit maritime international ( CMI ) could provide detailed guidance on the use of electronic messages to create bills of lading , they could not provide a legal basis for such bills since the rules were voluntary .  
Detailed and specific projects for each of the eight countries , focused on a combination of training and supportive measures to strengthen supply capabilities based on the needs already identified , have been prepared for each country and currently await formal approval from the country authorities concerned .  
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 24 , welcomed with satisfaction the second interim report on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights ( economic , social and cultural rights ) prepared by Mr . El Hadji Guiss ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 15 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At its forty-eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty _ eighth session the Sub _ Commission had before it the revised set of basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law prepared by Mr . van Boven ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 17 ) .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
The incumbent would also be responsible for the collection and analysis of studies on peacekeeping operations prepared by national , research and academic institutions , as well as the planning and organization of lessons learned seminars or workshops , consultations with external experts and visits of lessons learned teams to the field .  
However , such acceptance had not assured their effective implementation , although about 100 countries had prepared national environmental strategies , and tangible changes were apparent in about half of them .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
VIII . 168 .  With regard to the methodology for apportionment of medical costs , the Advisory Committee was informed that this provides for the share of each participating organization to be determined on the basis of statistics prepared by the Joint Medical Service on the actual usage of the Service by the different organizations broken down by items such as medical exams , x-rays and laboratory tests , vaccinations and nursing care and administrative work .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
Success criteria will be measured in terms of the number and quality of business plans prepared and implemented , an increase in the number of viable and profitable small - and medium-scale enterprises and people employed , and a continuous rise in the levels of investments recorded .  
With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolution 1996 / 28 , decided to transmit the revised draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission , Mr . Theo van Boven to the Commission on Human Rights for its consideration .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
We must be prepared to face other kinds of war : social war against poverty ; judicial war against organized crime ; political war against interventionism in our sovereign economies ; and moral war against the violation of human rights . 
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These negotiations , in our opinion , will be more productive if there is a clear understanding of the imperative need to maintain the basic provisions of the Convention intact and if all negotiating parties are prepared to demonstrate their political willingness to seek mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues in the agreed text of the Convention .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
In the report on this subject prepared two years ago for the Commission for Social Development , it was emphasized that , in a period of rapid change , it was particularly difficult to identify significant trends and distinguish transient from lasting changes affecting society .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
As soon as practicable , after an issue has been included in the work programme , a structured and detailed design plan for the inspection , evaluation or investigation and a detailed plan for scheduling activities , including the most effective and timely means of gathering the information required , is prepared by the responsible Inspector ( s ) , assisted by the Executive Secretary and designated research staff .  
The only explanation seems to lie in the fact that Israel has realized that the Security Council is not prepared to live up to its commitments to stop aggression , thanks to the unqualified and continuous support of certain members who , at most and out of sheer embarrassment , express dissatisfaction with the atrocious Israeli practices in the occupied areas .  
In light of such demands , committee membership will be feasible only for governmental officials paid by their national authorities ( a situation unlikely to guarantee either independence or expertise ) , academics subsidized by their Governments ( since in todays climate of budget cuts and a user-pays approach most universities are unlikely to be prepared to subsidize international service for half the year ) , or retirees .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
Many of those interviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit stated that background papers and proposals for policy decisions were usually distributed too late , and as a result agency representatives often did not come to the meetings prepared to act on proposals ; many meetings had been convened with no concrete objectives set ; and work initiated by the Working Group on specific issues had been pursued in an on-and-off fashion , only reaching conclusion three to four years after initiation .  
On the other hand , it should be understood that such operations must not be sporadic and that they are planned or prepared by organized armed groups capable of taking concerted action .  
Takes note of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ;  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr . Theo van Boven ,  
By its resolution 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 , the Security Council decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 ( " International Tribunal " ) and adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General 's report prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) of 22 February 1993 .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
In addition , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47 / 180 , they had prepared national reports , established national committees with broad-based participation and made specific proposals and firm commitments regarding housing and human settlements at the national and international levels .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
A short but substantive / analytical / factual summary prepared by the Secretariat of the informal consultations of the Security Council should be circulated as an official document of the Council to all Member States the day after such meetings .  
In almost all countries , as soon as possible after admission , each juvenile was interviewed and a psychological and social report identifying any factors relevant to the specific type and level of care and programme required by the juvenile was prepared .  
The meeting concluded that a comprehensive report examining the adequacy of observational networks , identifying the existing gaps and quantifying the financial and human resources required , should be prepared for the ninth session of the SBSTA .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
As this report was being prepared , considerable concern was being expressed inside and outside of Iran at a rash of disappearances and suspicious deaths of dissident literary and political figures :  
A document entitled Education for a viable future in the Americas is being prepared , which reflects international thinking on the subject , following the meeting on that theme organized by UNESCO in Thessaloniki , Greece , in December 1997 .  
In addition , it was stated that the fact that some States were parties to an international text prepared at a regional level should not preclude a universal body like UNCITRAL from preparing uniform rules on issues covered by such an international text .  
The democratic process is not being paralysed by the war : it was already paralysed and the constitutional drafts that have been prepared are not satisfactory to the large majorities which are still represented in the National Sovereign Conference and are , of course , likely to be changed by another authentic national agreement .
