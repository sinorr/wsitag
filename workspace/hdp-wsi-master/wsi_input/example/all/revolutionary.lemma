Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
While joining the discussion meeting of Hebei Delegation , State Councilor Ismail Amat pointed out that it is imperative to proceed from the height of stressing politics and the overall situation to understand the work of giving special care to and making special arrangement for disabled servicemen and family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and proceed from the angle of supporting the modernization building of the army and national defense to solidly do this work well and create excellent social environments for the country 's reform , development , and stability as well as army building .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
In the past half-century , the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee carried forward Mr . Sun Yat-sen 's patriotic , revolutionary , and progressive spirit ; voluntarily subjected itself to the leadership of the CPC , played an active role as a party involved in administration , made contributions to the great cause of national reunification and regeneration ;  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
The college conforms to its motto of " dedication , strictness , struggling for might , and being realistic " and creatively promotes education using the name of the " blue Project " , with its theme of loving battleships , loving islands and loving the sea .  This education has reinforced ideals and conviction , the sense of the military soul and the spirit of dedication .  This is compared to rooting " three pillars " so that students will become revolutionary military professionals loyal to the Party and to the people .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
and opened up China 's future .  It was their great thinking , noble character , and immortal achievements that inspired us to carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and courageously forge ahead into the future .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
He fully expressed the lofty demeanour of a proletarian revolutionary and the fine work style of a Chinese communist by his hard work and plain living , modesty and prudence , diligence and pragmatism , and selfless devotion .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .  
Persistent and courageous , calm and composed , brave and unyielding , he offered his precious life in defending the country 's sovereignty and the nation 's dignity when carrying out the latest task of tracking and monitoring the US reconnaissance plane .  With an undaunted spirit of valor , he realized our army 's purpose and composed a magnificent song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
We are determined to bear in mind Chairman Jiang 's instructions , carry forward Wang Wei 's spirit of fearing no sacrifice and dedicating ourselves to the motherland 's interests , continue to enhance the revolutionary character of the troops , quicken the pace of modernization and regularization , work hard to practice and master military skills , guarantee the winning of the future war , and guarantee that the character of the armed forces will never change .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
The vast numbers of officers and men of all of the armed services and the Armed Police have been greatly inspired by the report that Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin signed an order to confer the honorable title of " Guardian of the Sea and Air " on Wang Wei , and vowed to emulate Wang Wei and turn their patriotic passion into deeds to build up the military and to worthily serve the country and to work diligently for the building of modern and regularized revolutionary armed forces .  
Comrade Wang Enmao , an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China , a tested and loyal fighter for communism , a proletarian revolutionary , a brilliant political leader of the party and the army , and a vice chairman of the Sixth and Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , passed away at 10:45 on 12 April 2001 in Beijing , after his illness failed to respond to any medical treatment .  He was 88 years old .  
In the past 71 years since its founding , persisting in integrating the basic tenet of Marxism with Vietnam 's concrete practice , upholding Marxism and Ho Chi Minh 's thought , persisting in party leadership , persisting in the socialist road , the CPV has led the Vietnamese people to victoriously accomplish national liberation and unification of the country after undergoing a most arduous and bitter revolutionary struggle .  The CPV has scored remarkable achievements in the cause of socialist construction and has founded a road for development compatible with Vietnam 's national conditions .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
while undertaking this flying mission of tracking and watching this US reconnaisance plane , he flew with outstanding determination and courage , kept composed and calm , displayed heroic and stubborn spirit , and wrote with his life a stirring song of victory of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had broad revolutionary ideals and the spirit of lofty dedication ; he practiced our army 's fundamental purpose in model fashion , and faithfully carried out our army 's basic function ; he is an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary servicemen .  
He said , Comrade Wang Wei is another heroic fighter who has come to the fore in the people 's army in the new era .  His heroic actions fully expressed the strong resolve of the officers and men of our armed forces to defend national sovereignty and preserve national dignity , expressed the lofty realm of revolutionary fighters in loyalty to the motherland , selfless dedication , and brave sacrifice , and displayed the brand-new style of the people 's army in the new era .  
Displaying lofty patriotism and dauntless revolutionary heroism , he loyally discharged the glorious responsibilities that the party and the people gave him , and he firmly safeguarded the nation 's sovereignty and dignity .  He composed a heroic epic with his young life .  Comrade Wang Wei laid down his life for the motherland and the people .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
The CYL organizations at various levels also held activities of " visiting the home of Zhang Wentian , " " showing respect for those who won merits , " comforting retired veteran cadres , " finding revolutionary sites " and " learning revolutionary spirit " to help the broad masses of young people and children further understand the 80 years of brilliant history of the CPC and enhance their determination to love the party and the socialist motherland .  
After the beginning of reform and opening , Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed on many occasions the need to enhance national defense education among the entire citizens and especially among young people , thus encouraging them to carry forward the patriotic spirit and the revolutionary heroic spirit .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and thanks to the vigorous support and selfless assistance of all brother provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have forged ahead in unity in a pioneering spirit , speeded up the region 's development , defended the unification of the motherland and fought against national splittism , and have attained world-acclaimed achievements in the region 's socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
Reviewing the spirit of struggle of our party in the Jinggangshan period along with the valuable historical experiences and excellent revolutionary traditions formed in the struggle has strong significance for the current strengthening of party building and the party 's close link with the masses .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
Without such a guide , the revolutionary contingent would still be disunited and weak , could hardly realize its objectives as planned , and may even lose their way and digress towards the wrong direction , despite the enormous potentiality to change the current situation and the relatively mature revolutionary situation .  
Mao Zedong opposed book worship and started out from the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution to skillfully combine basic Marxist principles with China 's revolutionary practices and creatively develop Marxism and Leninism . He advanced the new democratic revolution theory and the theory of embarking on the road of surrounding the cities with villages , and with that , he seized victory in the Chinese revolution and truly achieved the first great leap in integrating basic Marxist and Leninist principles with China 's realistic conditions .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
This unprecedented photo exhibition - - in chronological order and by means of detailed and genuine materials and vivid pictures of the past - - genuinely repeats the splendid 80-year history of the Communist Party of China , affectingly recalling the lofty spirit that inspired countless revolutionary martyrs to die .  The exhibition enthusiastically sings praise to the great achievements of the revolution , the construction and reform made by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
Over the past 80 years , the CPC has organized and led arduous revolutionary struggles against aggressors from the outside and reactionaries at home , won a victory in the people 's revolution , founded socialist new China on the vast land of China , and achieved tremendous progress and changes on the road of invigorating China and realizing national reunification .  
The stern tests of the revolutionary war , the painstaking exploration for the course of national reconstruction , the innovative practice of reform and opening up all recorded the party 's deeds of leading the people to bravely and indomitably carry out triumphant and momentous struggle .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of the personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of cadres who are more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and more competent professionally and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber officials who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Everyone said , in building a powerful modernized and regularized revolutionary armed forces , it is essential to consistently uphold the fundamental principle of absolute party leadership over the armed forces , and resolutely resist the influence of erroneous trends of thought such as " separating the armed forces from the party , " " depoliticizing the armed forces , " and " nationalizing the armed forces . "  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
We must keep firmly in mind the purpose of the party , maintain close links with the masses , and serve the people wholeheartedly ; we must maintain the lofty communist values and revolutionary integrity and be the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comforts ; we must fortify our convictions , strengthen our spirits , engage in unostentatious hard work , advance in a pioneering spirit , and add a new chapter to history by scoring new historic achievements .  
Luo Gan said : Comrade Dong Biwu was a proletarian revolutionary revered and cherished by the entire party and all people throughout the country .  He was a founder of the CPC , an outstanding Marxist politician and law expert , an important member of the party 's first-generation leading collective , and an important member of the central people 's government of the New China .  
From the above two fundamental characteristics of the working class , we can see that the working class is a proletarian class that is the most selfless , that does not seek personal gain , and that regards liberating the whole of mankind as the prerequisite for liberating themselves , and we can see that it is a class that has revolutionary steadfastness and thoroughness , as well as a strict organizational and disciplinary nature .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
As commanding organs for the entire army , the four general departments put forward : We must attain a high standard in putting the " three represents " into practice and - - with a strong sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency in a race against time - - break new ground , make advances , and make innovations with keen determination to comprehensively advance the building of a more revolutionary , modern , and regularized army and struggle hard for accomplishing the historical mission entrusted to our army by the party and the people .  
make great efforts to build a contingent of high-caliber cadres in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and the principle of attaching equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity ;  
This has been proven by practice of fundamental , universal , long duration , great importance , which has a bearing on the long-term development of the party 's cause .  Only when this issue is solved properly , can our party always retain its advanced and revolutionary nature and creativity and can it establish itself in an unassailable position .  
we must comprehensively implement the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity , deepen the reform of personnel system , and strive to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the tests of trials and tribulations ;  
These lifetime revolutionary companions who were born in the same month of the same year were well-experienced and loyal communist soldiers and outstanding proletariat revolutionaries ; they made major indelible contributions to China 's revolution and developmental undertakings .  
Zhang Wannian emphatically said : When we cherish the memory of comrade Xu Haidong , we should learn from him his firm belief in the communist cause , his revolutionary spirit of utter devotion for the people , his fine style of waging arduous struggles and maintaining close ties with the masses , his noble character of being frank and open , his making selfless contributions , his clear idea of what one should hate or love , and his adhering to the truth .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
Various localities are continuing the comprehensive and deep-going " activity of giving love to meritorious persons " and properly solving such practical problems as " difficulty in housing , difficulty in livelihood , and difficulty in getting medical care " among the disabled servicemen and the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen who are entitled to special care .  The implementation of the policies concerning them has been promoted .  
He paid noble tribute to those proletarian revolutionaries of the elder generation who performed tremendous deeds and made great contributions during the revolutionary wars , those retired veteran cadres and heroic models from the army who have made outstanding contributions to the building of our army !  
The representatives of retired veteran cadres who are in Beijing , responsible persons of every relevant department of the army , heroic models of troops , militiamen in the capital , members of army-men families and revolutionary martyrs families , and representatives of former Kuomintang personnel who launched righteous revolts also attended the reception .  
We should thoroughgoingly carry out education on patriotism , collectivism , revolutionary traditions , and on the need to carry out to a hard struggle ; help the vast numbers of public security officers establish a correct outlook on the world , the life , and values ; and take resolute steps to resist the corrosive influences of money worship , pleasure-seeking , out-and-out egoism , and other erroneous ideologies .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
To foster a revolutionary spirit and a strong will capable of meeting future sea warfare , the academy has carefully designed its curricula and teaching methods to meet practical needs .  It has persisted in training both the combat strength and the state of mind with emphasis on enhancing the cadets ' collectivist concept of fighting in unity .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin pointed out : We are holding a solemn meeting here today to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Zhang Wentian and to commemorate this staunch Marxist and outstanding proletarian revolutionary who fought all his life for the party 's cause .  We will cherish the memory of his immortal feats in working for the motherland and for the people through long years of revolution and construction , and will take over and carry forward his lofty spirit and revolutionary bearing .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .  
All military academies should energetically promote the good practice of respecting teachers and assigning importance to teaching , strive to foster more excellent teachers like Liu Yixin , fundamentally improve the level of teaching and the quality of education , fully bring into play the role of military academy education as a matter of fundamental and overall importance in providing the lead in the modernization of the army , and make new and greater contributions to the building of our army into a revolutionary , modernized and standardized army , he said .  
This book series has condensed the changes of the Chinese nation in a century .  It has especially displayed in a concentrated manner the historical facts about the earth-shaking struggle waged by numerous revolutionary martyrs under the leadership of the CPC for national independence , the liberation of the people , and the cause of socialist construction , and has vividly recorded the lofty revolutionary spirit of the Chinese communists of heroically fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people , fearing no sacrifice .  
Fighting side by side with the Korean People 's Army , this group army dauntlessly carried forward revolutionary spirits and comprehensively won the first battle against the US 1st Marine Division , a crack unit in the United States . After that , in the spirit of consecutive operations , this group hurled itself upon the enemy , pressed up to Pukhankang River , broke through at Soyangkang River , surprised Omal Temple , and violently attacked the " White Tiger Regiment , " thus having created army and national prestige .  
The Chinese People 's Volunteers headed for Korea by order to fight side by side with the Korean army and people .  Displaying the revolutionary heroic spirit of fearing no powerful enemy and sacrifice , and enduring numerous hardships , they defeated the insufferably arrogant aggressors .  
All activities in connection with the ideological and political education must meet the basic requirements of the four kinds of education , namely , education in patriotic dedication , education in the revolutionary philosophy of life , education aimed at respecting cadres and loving soldiers , and education about the need for hard struggle .  
The meeting pointed out that the existing Chinese People 's Liberation Army Ordinance Governing Officers on Active Duty , since its implementation in 1988 , has played an important role in enabling the officers of the People 's Liberation Army and the People 's Armed Police Force to become more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more professionally competent ; in boosting their initiative and creativity ; and in ensuring their observance of law in performing military duties .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
In the bill requesting deliberation on the draft revision , Premier Zhu Rongji and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin said : Since the regulations were put into force , they have played an important role in making the corps of our military officers more revolutionary , lowering the average age of officers , raising the their educational level , and making them more professionally competent , as well as heightening the initiative and creativity of the large numbers of officers .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
He told this reporter : Compiled by Mao Zedong and published in the past , " Selected Works of Mao Zedong " carries Mao 's most representative works written during the period of democratic revolution , and those works have since remained in circulation throughout the world as Mao 's classic works aimed at soundly integrating Marxism with China 's revolutionary realities , and as the most basic works guiding us in learning about and studying Mao Zedong Thought for a long time to come .  
This important document aims to specifically implement the 16-character guiding policy governing Sino-Vietnamese ties .  It has specified the orientation , tasks , and ways for both sides to strengthen and expand bilateral friendly cooperation in various fields .  It has the important significance of carrying forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
In the whole Army , over 1,000 retired cadre housing quarters organized retired cadres to study and receive education in the forms of giving party lectures and carrying out inner-party organizational activities around the subject of " firmly keeping the ideal and belief , maintaining political integrity in our late years . "  The retired cadres were guided to consciously take the lead in exposing and denouncing " Falungong " and keep a firm political position , keep a new idea , and keep the revolutionary ideal .  
Correct ideological theories and high-technology knowledge were used to arm the minds of the troops .  Great efforts were made to promote the spirit of making unswerving efforts for the realization of socialist modernization as advocated by Chairman Jiang Zemin , and prompt the vast number of officers and servicemen to become revolutionary soldiers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline , and make this their noble pursuit and action .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
They were very happy to have the opportunity to observe the congress in session . They were particularly excited by the revolutionary stand of the Kuomintang in the adopted party platform , pledging itself to remain in the democratic camp , and to unite all the people 's strength from at home and abroad , as well as from behind the enemy lines , for the final victory of national recovery against the Communists .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
According to Professor Ben Achour , French public law is a weapon for new nation-States in formation with its basic concepts of an autonomous administrative law reflecting the superiority of public interest and public service , whereas its liberal face inspired reformist and nationalist movements demanding the enforcement of revolutionary and republican principles .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Under the wise leadership of the great leader , the people in the northern half of our Republic vigorously accelerated the three revolutions , ideological , technical and cultural , holding high the banner of the Juche idea , and thus cemented rock-firm our revolutionary base , a decisive guarantee of national reunification .  
In a sphere which was so complex at the technical level and so delicate at the political level , it was not advisable to adopt an innovative and revolutionary approach .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
While joining the discussion meeting of Hebei Delegation , State Councilor Ismail Amat pointed out that it is imperative to proceed from the height of stressing politics and the overall situation to understand the work of giving special care to and making special arrangement for disabled servicemen and family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen and proceed from the angle of supporting the modernization building of the army and national defense to solidly do this work well and create excellent social environments for the country 's reform , development , and stability as well as army building .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
They have made glorious achievements and formed an excellent tradition for the military 's work in the literary and artistic field .  The facts prove that only by being closely associated with the great revolutionary struggles and with people 's putting theories into practice can the military 's work in the literary and artistic field make great achievements and establish its proper social position .  
to insure that all could , on a basis of their own initiative , learn revolutionary theories , guard and fight against the corrosion of corrupt ideology and culture , persistently struggle against schools of reactionary ideological trends , against idealistic and pseudoscientific ideologies ; that all should take in fact the Marxist world outlook , outlook on life , values , and take the initiative in socialist cultural civilization construction ;  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
In the protracted and complex revolutionary struggle , our party , growing from small to big and from weak to strong , has become the force at the core leading the Chinese revolution and construction .  A fundamental experience is that we have always upheld the principle of strictly administering the party .  
It is necessary to deeply understand and master the new requirements put forth by the " three represents " for the ideological and political building , so as to lay a firm theoretical foundation to unwaveringly uphold the revolutionary ideals and beliefs , consolidate the ideological defense line to unwaveringly uphold the essence and aim of the people 's army , and master the correct direction to unwaveringly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army .  
It is one of our military 's excellent traditions in ideological and political work to help the broad number of officials and soldiers to strengthen their conviction , mold their sentiment and inspire their fighting spirit by singing revolutionary songs .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
In the past half-century , the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee carried forward Mr . Sun Yat-sen 's patriotic , revolutionary , and progressive spirit ; voluntarily subjected itself to the leadership of the CPC , played an active role as a party involved in administration , made contributions to the great cause of national reunification and regeneration ;  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
First , national independence and liberation of the people had to be achieved - - this was the biggest liberation of the productive force and required opposition of the imperialist and feudal military forces as well as unification of the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie classes to establish a broad , united revolutionary battlefront .  
The college conforms to its motto of " dedication , strictness , struggling for might , and being realistic " and creatively promotes education using the name of the " blue Project " , with its theme of loving battleships , loving islands and loving the sea .  This education has reinforced ideals and conviction , the sense of the military soul and the spirit of dedication .  This is compared to rooting " three pillars " so that students will become revolutionary military professionals loyal to the Party and to the people .  
and guide the vast numbers of our officers and men to establish a correct outlook on the world , life , and values so that they can always retain the true political color of revolutionary military men .  Third , we should keep to the correct direction , and never waver in upholding the principle that the party should command the gun .  To strengthen the ideological and political building in line with the requirement of " three represents " , the heart of the issue is to uphold the party 's absolute leadership over the military ;  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
The " Decision " by the party committee of the PLA General Staff Headquarters pointed out : With a strong sense of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a highly developed sense of political responsibility , Comrade Liu Yixin has brought up large numbers of outstanding talents for the modernization building of our army , and has achieved fruitful results in teaching and scientific research ; and his devotion to the military academic and educational undertaking has set an example for us .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
and opened up China 's future .  It was their great thinking , noble character , and immortal achievements that inspired us to carry forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and courageously forge ahead into the future .  
Mao Zedong applied the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with concrete Chinese reality , to give accurate answers to a number of problems : the nature of society and revolution in China , the revolution 's leading class and its allies , China 's unique revolutionary road , etc .  While pointing the Chinese revolution in the right direction , he also creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism .  
During this centralized education , Party members and cadres in grassroots units meticulously studied the important thinking of the " three represents , " touched on and solved some problems that are incongruous with the needs of the Party 's advanced nature , improved their ideological conscientiousness , and inspired their revolutionary will to fight .  
The spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will is the precious spiritual wealth made by the Party and the military through prolonged revolutionary and construction practices as well as the embodiment of the positive spiritual state of both Party members and revolutionary military professionals .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
Firm ideals and convictions are the ideological basis of assuring our revolutionary military professionals are politically qualified and maintaining their essential qualities and the spiritual backbone and resources for these professionals to live through tests , overcome difficulties and make achievements in their careers .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Guided by revolutionary theory , he plunged into the practice of revolutionary struggle with tremendous political fervor and outstanding courage and insight , and engaged in pioneering practice and exploration in party building , theoretical propaganda , united front work , mass work , and armed struggle ; in these he made outstanding contributions and fully displayed the leadership talent of a politician and social activist .  
He fully expressed the lofty demeanour of a proletarian revolutionary and the fine work style of a Chinese communist by his hard work and plain living , modesty and prudence , diligence and pragmatism , and selfless devotion .  
While performing the flying duty of tracking and monitoring the US military electronic reconnaissance plane this time , he displayed determination , courage , calmness , cool-headedness , heroism , and tenacity .  By sacrificing his life , he composed a glorious victorious song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had high revolutionary aspirations and a lofty spirit of selfless devotion .  He put into practice our military 's fundamental objectives in an exemplary manner , and fulfilled our military 's fundamental functions in a faithful way .  He was an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary military servicemen .  
Persistent and courageous , calm and composed , brave and unyielding , he offered his precious life in defending the country 's sovereignty and the nation 's dignity when carrying out the latest task of tracking and monitoring the US reconnaissance plane .  With an undaunted spirit of valor , he realized our army 's purpose and composed a magnificent song of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had ambitious revolutionary ideals and a lofty spirit of dedication .  He set a fine example in living up to our army 's fundamental purpose and faithfully carried out our army 's fundamental function and thus was an outstanding representative of revolutionary servicemen of the new generation .  
We are determined to bear in mind Chairman Jiang 's instructions , carry forward Wang Wei 's spirit of fearing no sacrifice and dedicating ourselves to the motherland 's interests , continue to enhance the revolutionary character of the troops , quicken the pace of modernization and regularization , work hard to practice and master military skills , guarantee the winning of the future war , and guarantee that the character of the armed forces will never change .  
While enforcing the task of flying to tail and monitor the US military reconnaissance airplane , Comrade Wang Wei was resolute and decisive , calm and cool-headed , and courageous and indomitable .  In order to safeguard state sovereignty and national dignity , he dedicated his valuable life , thus putting the aim of our army into practice with his utterly fearless revolutionary behavior .  
The vast numbers of officers and men of all of the armed services and the Armed Police have been greatly inspired by the report that Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin signed an order to confer the honorable title of " Guardian of the Sea and Air " on Wang Wei , and vowed to emulate Wang Wei and turn their patriotic passion into deeds to build up the military and to worthily serve the country and to work diligently for the building of modern and regularized revolutionary armed forces .  
Comrade Wang Enmao , an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China , a tested and loyal fighter for communism , a proletarian revolutionary , a brilliant political leader of the party and the army , and a vice chairman of the Sixth and Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , passed away at 10:45 on 12 April 2001 in Beijing , after his illness failed to respond to any medical treatment .  He was 88 years old .  
In the past 71 years since its founding , persisting in integrating the basic tenet of Marxism with Vietnam 's concrete practice , upholding Marxism and Ho Chi Minh 's thought , persisting in party leadership , persisting in the socialist road , the CPV has led the Vietnamese people to victoriously accomplish national liberation and unification of the country after undergoing a most arduous and bitter revolutionary struggle .  The CPV has scored remarkable achievements in the cause of socialist construction and has founded a road for development compatible with Vietnam 's national conditions .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
while undertaking this flying mission of tracking and watching this US reconnaisance plane , he flew with outstanding determination and courage , kept composed and calm , displayed heroic and stubborn spirit , and wrote with his life a stirring song of victory of patriotism and revolutionary heroism .  
Comrade Wang Wei had broad revolutionary ideals and the spirit of lofty dedication ; he practiced our army 's fundamental purpose in model fashion , and faithfully carried out our army 's basic function ; he is an outstanding representative of the new generation of revolutionary servicemen .  
He said , Comrade Wang Wei is another heroic fighter who has come to the fore in the people 's army in the new era .  His heroic actions fully expressed the strong resolve of the officers and men of our armed forces to defend national sovereignty and preserve national dignity , expressed the lofty realm of revolutionary fighters in loyalty to the motherland , selfless dedication , and brave sacrifice , and displayed the brand-new style of the people 's army in the new era .  
Displaying lofty patriotism and dauntless revolutionary heroism , he loyally discharged the glorious responsibilities that the party and the people gave him , and he firmly safeguarded the nation 's sovereignty and dignity .  He composed a heroic epic with his young life .  Comrade Wang Wei laid down his life for the motherland and the people .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
Today , old comrades like us who used to work under his direct leadership and who stood with him through storm and stress in shouldering the historic mission are cherishing all the more this long-tested and loyal communist fighter , proletarian revolutionary and China 's outstanding leader on the diplomatic front .  Esteem and love for him well up in our hearts as we recall the historic and outstanding contributions he had made to the smooth handover of Hong Kong and Macao and the efforts he made in laying the foundation for long-term stability and prosperity .  
The CYL organizations at various levels also held activities of " visiting the home of Zhang Wentian , " " showing respect for those who won merits , " comforting retired veteran cadres , " finding revolutionary sites " and " learning revolutionary spirit " to help the broad masses of young people and children further understand the 80 years of brilliant history of the CPC and enhance their determination to love the party and the socialist motherland .  
After the beginning of reform and opening , Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed on many occasions the need to enhance national defense education among the entire citizens and especially among young people , thus encouraging them to carry forward the patriotic spirit and the revolutionary heroic spirit .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .

To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
Reviewing the spirit of struggle of our party in the Jinggangshan period along with the valuable historical experiences and excellent revolutionary traditions formed in the struggle has strong significance for the current strengthening of party building and the party 's close link with the masses .  
It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
Without such a guide , the revolutionary contingent would still be disunited and weak , could hardly realize its objectives as planned , and may even lose their way and digress towards the wrong direction , despite the enormous potentiality to change the current situation and the relatively mature revolutionary situation .  
Mao Zedong opposed book worship and started out from the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution to skillfully combine basic Marxist principles with China 's revolutionary practices and creatively develop Marxism and Leninism . He advanced the new democratic revolution theory and the theory of embarking on the road of surrounding the cities with villages , and with that , he seized victory in the Chinese revolution and truly achieved the first great leap in integrating basic Marxist and Leninist principles with China 's realistic conditions .  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
This unprecedented photo exhibition - - in chronological order and by means of detailed and genuine materials and vivid pictures of the past - - genuinely repeats the splendid 80-year history of the Communist Party of China , affectingly recalling the lofty spirit that inspired countless revolutionary martyrs to die .  The exhibition enthusiastically sings praise to the great achievements of the revolution , the construction and reform made by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
Over the past 80 years , the CPC has organized and led arduous revolutionary struggles against aggressors from the outside and reactionaries at home , won a victory in the people 's revolution , founded socialist new China on the vast land of China , and achieved tremendous progress and changes on the road of invigorating China and realizing national reunification .  
The stern tests of the revolutionary war , the painstaking exploration for the course of national reconstruction , the innovative practice of reform and opening up all recorded the party 's deeds of leading the people to bravely and indomitably carry out triumphant and momentous struggle .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of the personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of cadres who are more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and more competent professionally and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber officials who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
Everyone said , in building a powerful modernized and regularized revolutionary armed forces , it is essential to consistently uphold the fundamental principle of absolute party leadership over the armed forces , and resolutely resist the influence of erroneous trends of thought such as " separating the armed forces from the party , " " depoliticizing the armed forces , " and " nationalizing the armed forces . "  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
We must study their approach of building a Party to serve the people , being upright and honest , and vigorously promoting socialist morality , consciously guarding against unhealthy tendencies , resolutely struggling with all negative and corrupt phenomena , and always maintaining the true revolutionary character of CPC personnel .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
We should comprehensively implement the principle on promoting younger , better educated , more professionally competent , and revolutionary cadres and the criterion on both ability and political integrity , exercise strict education and management on party member-cadres , pay keen attention to recruiting new party members from among outstanding young and middle-aged students and teachers , further strengthen the cohesive power and creativity of party organizations of schools of higher learning , and provide strong and effective political guarantee for reform , development , and stability of the cause of higher education .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
We must keep firmly in mind the purpose of the party , maintain close links with the masses , and serve the people wholeheartedly ; we must maintain the lofty communist values and revolutionary integrity and be the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comforts ; we must fortify our convictions , strengthen our spirits , engage in unostentatious hard work , advance in a pioneering spirit , and add a new chapter to history by scoring new historic achievements .  
Luo Gan said : Comrade Dong Biwu was a proletarian revolutionary revered and cherished by the entire party and all people throughout the country .  He was a founder of the CPC , an outstanding Marxist politician and law expert , an important member of the party 's first-generation leading collective , and an important member of the central people 's government of the New China .  
From the above two fundamental characteristics of the working class , we can see that the working class is a proletarian class that is the most selfless , that does not seek personal gain , and that regards liberating the whole of mankind as the prerequisite for liberating themselves , and we can see that it is a class that has revolutionary steadfastness and thoroughness , as well as a strict organizational and disciplinary nature .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
Through the propaganda , we have been greatly touched and enhanced our thinking .  Chi Haotian said that through the propaganda campaign , the reporters have shown a high degree of revolutionary dedication and a strong sense of political responsibility .  With valuable professional dedication and despite difficulties and obstacles , these reporters went deep to frontier companies and forward posts , boldly faced hardships , worked indomitably , covered a lot of outstanding , brilliant , and touching news reports , and did a good job in performing their sacred missions and lofty duties .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
As commanding organs for the entire army , the four general departments put forward : We must attain a high standard in putting the " three represents " into practice and - - with a strong sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency in a race against time - - break new ground , make advances , and make innovations with keen determination to comprehensively advance the building of a more revolutionary , modern , and regularized army and struggle hard for accomplishing the historical mission entrusted to our army by the party and the people .  
make great efforts to build a contingent of high-caliber cadres in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and the principle of attaching equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity ;  
This has been proven by practice of fundamental , universal , long duration , great importance , which has a bearing on the long-term development of the party 's cause .  Only when this issue is solved properly , can our party always retain its advanced and revolutionary nature and creativity and can it establish itself in an unassailable position .  
we must comprehensively implement the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity , deepen the reform of personnel system , and strive to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the tests of trials and tribulations ;  
These lifetime revolutionary companions who were born in the same month of the same year were well-experienced and loyal communist soldiers and outstanding proletariat revolutionaries ; they made major indelible contributions to China 's revolution and developmental undertakings .  
Zhang Wannian emphatically said : When we cherish the memory of comrade Xu Haidong , we should learn from him his firm belief in the communist cause , his revolutionary spirit of utter devotion for the people , his fine style of waging arduous struggles and maintaining close ties with the masses , his noble character of being frank and open , his making selfless contributions , his clear idea of what one should hate or love , and his adhering to the truth .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
All of this may be both familiar and unfamiliar to each of those who experienced the " Cultural Revolution , " but what is most moving is that , in the face of these frenzied political storms and enormous political pressures , Deng Xiaoping showed himself as a long-tested revolutionary and demonstrated the true qualities of a mature politician .  
Various localities are continuing the comprehensive and deep-going " activity of giving love to meritorious persons " and properly solving such practical problems as " difficulty in housing , difficulty in livelihood , and difficulty in getting medical care " among the disabled servicemen and the families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen who are entitled to special care .  The implementation of the policies concerning them has been promoted .  
He paid noble tribute to those proletarian revolutionaries of the elder generation who performed tremendous deeds and made great contributions during the revolutionary wars , those retired veteran cadres and heroic models from the army who have made outstanding contributions to the building of our army !  
The representatives of retired veteran cadres who are in Beijing , responsible persons of every relevant department of the army , heroic models of troops , militiamen in the capital , members of army-men families and revolutionary martyrs families , and representatives of former Kuomintang personnel who launched righteous revolts also attended the reception .  
We should thoroughgoingly carry out education on patriotism , collectivism , revolutionary traditions , and on the need to carry out to a hard struggle ; help the vast numbers of public security officers establish a correct outlook on the world , the life , and values ; and take resolute steps to resist the corrosive influences of money worship , pleasure-seeking , out-and-out egoism , and other erroneous ideologies .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
As far as the cadet 's ideological and political quality is concerned , the academy holds that a revolutionary ideal embodies a concentrated reflection of the scientific world outlook , philosophy of life , and values , that the military spirit emphasizing the party 's absolute leadership over the PLA is the foundation for ensuring the PLA 's unchanged quality , and that the highly patriotic spirit of dedication is an inexhaustible driving force for service members to take root in the PLA to perform meritorious deeds .  
To foster a revolutionary spirit and a strong will capable of meeting future sea warfare , the academy has carefully designed its curricula and teaching methods to meet practical needs .  It has persisted in training both the combat strength and the state of mind with emphasis on enhancing the cadets ' collectivist concept of fighting in unity .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin pointed out : We are holding a solemn meeting here today to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Zhang Wentian and to commemorate this staunch Marxist and outstanding proletarian revolutionary who fought all his life for the party 's cause .  We will cherish the memory of his immortal feats in working for the motherland and for the people through long years of revolution and construction , and will take over and carry forward his lofty spirit and revolutionary bearing .  
He said : In his half-century revolutionary career , Comrade Su Yu performed immortal feats for the liberation of the Chinese people , and made important contributions to building a modern and regularized revolutionary army ; strengthening the national defense of the New China ; and enriching and developing Mao Zedong military thinking , leaving behind him an everlasting monument and a precious legacy .  
His advanced deeds and noble spirit fully embody the lofty realm of communists and revolutionary soldiers in consciously practicing " three represents , " and demonstrates the spiritual outlook of teachers of military academies who heroically blaze new trails , are content in serving as the ladder for others to get ahead , and work with selflessly devotion .  
All military academies should energetically promote the good practice of respecting teachers and assigning importance to teaching , strive to foster more excellent teachers like Liu Yixin , fundamentally improve the level of teaching and the quality of education , fully bring into play the role of military academy education as a matter of fundamental and overall importance in providing the lead in the modernization of the army , and make new and greater contributions to the building of our army into a revolutionary , modernized and standardized army , he said .  
This book series has condensed the changes of the Chinese nation in a century .  It has especially displayed in a concentrated manner the historical facts about the earth-shaking struggle waged by numerous revolutionary martyrs under the leadership of the CPC for national independence , the liberation of the people , and the cause of socialist construction , and has vividly recorded the lofty revolutionary spirit of the Chinese communists of heroically fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people , fearing no sacrifice .  
Fighting side by side with the Korean People 's Army , this group army dauntlessly carried forward revolutionary spirits and comprehensively won the first battle against the US 1st Marine Division , a crack unit in the United States . After that , in the spirit of consecutive operations , this group hurled itself upon the enemy , pressed up to Pukhankang River , broke through at Soyangkang River , surprised Omal Temple , and violently attacked the " White Tiger Regiment , " thus having created army and national prestige .  
The Chinese People 's Volunteers headed for Korea by order to fight side by side with the Korean army and people .  Displaying the revolutionary heroic spirit of fearing no powerful enemy and sacrifice , and enduring numerous hardships , they defeated the insufferably arrogant aggressors .  
All activities in connection with the ideological and political education must meet the basic requirements of the four kinds of education , namely , education in patriotic dedication , education in the revolutionary philosophy of life , education aimed at respecting cadres and loving soldiers , and education about the need for hard struggle .  
The meeting pointed out that the existing Chinese People 's Liberation Army Ordinance Governing Officers on Active Duty , since its implementation in 1988 , has played an important role in enabling the officers of the People 's Liberation Army and the People 's Armed Police Force to become more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more professionally competent ; in boosting their initiative and creativity ; and in ensuring their observance of law in performing military duties .  
They focus on establishing the correct world outlook , life outlook , and concept of value to vigorously improve the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , regard cadres , especially cadres at senior and intermediate levels , as focal points to employ the spirit of rectifying work styles to resolve those outstanding issues in the aspects of party styles , clean and honest administrations , and revolutionary integrity , thus conducting the " four educations " in a vivid and lively manner and a solid and effective manner .  
As a fundamental engineering project of strengthening the ideological and political building of the army during the new era , the " four educations " have answered and resolved a series of fundamental issues about affirming revolutionary ideals and convictions like how to propagate the excellent traditions during the new era , how to lay a solid ideological foundation for establishing oneself and conducting oneself in life , and so on .  
In the bill requesting deliberation on the draft revision , Premier Zhu Rongji and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin said : Since the regulations were put into force , they have played an important role in making the corps of our military officers more revolutionary , lowering the average age of officers , raising the their educational level , and making them more professionally competent , as well as heightening the initiative and creativity of the large numbers of officers .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
He told this reporter : Compiled by Mao Zedong and published in the past , " Selected Works of Mao Zedong " carries Mao 's most representative works written during the period of democratic revolution , and those works have since remained in circulation throughout the world as Mao 's classic works aimed at soundly integrating Marxism with China 's revolutionary realities , and as the most basic works guiding us in learning about and studying Mao Zedong Thought for a long time to come .  
This important document aims to specifically implement the 16-character guiding policy governing Sino-Vietnamese ties .  It has specified the orientation , tasks , and ways for both sides to strengthen and expand bilateral friendly cooperation in various fields .  It has the important significance of carrying forward the revolutionary cause pioneered by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .  
Beginning in 2000 , the task will be pressing and arduous to continue to ensure sufficient food and clothing for the low-income populations living in poor rural areas who have not had sufficient food and clothing and those who have initially but not stably had sufficient food and clothing , and for the people living in poverty mainly in old revolutionary areas , minority nationality areas , pastoral areas , frontier areas , and other particularly poor areas ; and the task of preserving the results of poverty relief and development will be as pressing and arduous .  
In order to help the infatuates gradually stop being dependent on " Falungong " and master scientific ways of staying healthy , we arranged for medical staff and sports teachers to explain to them that healthy sports and recreational activities are the only things that would benefit physical and mental health .  We organized them to practice Taijiquan and fitness exercises ; conducted the activity of singing aloud revolutionary songs , such as " No Communist Party , No New China ; "  
In the whole Army , over 1,000 retired cadre housing quarters organized retired cadres to study and receive education in the forms of giving party lectures and carrying out inner-party organizational activities around the subject of " firmly keeping the ideal and belief , maintaining political integrity in our late years . "  The retired cadres were guided to consciously take the lead in exposing and denouncing " Falungong " and keep a firm political position , keep a new idea , and keep the revolutionary ideal .  
Correct ideological theories and high-technology knowledge were used to arm the minds of the troops .  Great efforts were made to promote the spirit of making unswerving efforts for the realization of socialist modernization as advocated by Chairman Jiang Zemin , and prompt the vast number of officers and servicemen to become revolutionary soldiers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline , and make this their noble pursuit and action .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
They were very happy to have the opportunity to observe the congress in session . They were particularly excited by the revolutionary stand of the Kuomintang in the adopted party platform , pledging itself to remain in the democratic camp , and to unite all the people 's strength from at home and abroad , as well as from behind the enemy lines , for the final victory of national recovery against the Communists .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
Besides these , other major avenues for Hsinhua included artistic love stories ( the critically acclaimed " Fire of Love " is a representative work ) , ancient period dramas and comedies produced purely for profit , and films relating the sacrifices of revolutionary martyrs who died for their country , like Hsiao Feng-hsien . These were also widely recognized as being among the more valuable of Hsinhua works .  
When the Republican Period began , Tan developed close relations with the Nationalist government , relying on his membership in the early revolutionary society Tung Meng Hui . With the additional factor of his considerable wealth , he indulged himself without reservation in various altruistic educational endeavors . He also commissioned his younger brother Tan Keng Hean to return to their home town and take charge of the business of founding and upgrading schools .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
This completed the stage of " revolutionary government " and marked the beginning of the stage of " tutelary government . " In this period , which was supposed to prepare the country for future constitutional government , the KMT was in full control , and such terms as parliament , elections , and political parties disappeared from view .  
According to Professor Ben Achour , French public law is a weapon for new nation-States in formation with its basic concepts of an autonomous administrative law reflecting the superiority of public interest and public service , whereas its liberal face inspired reformist and nationalist movements demanding the enforcement of revolutionary and republican principles .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
Of the major changes that have occurred in this century , there is no doubt that one of the most transcendent and revolutionary has been the gradual shift in the area of human rights away from the leading role traditionally played by the State and towards a new vision focused more on human beings than on the authorities wielding power .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
Under the wise leadership of the great leader , the people in the northern half of our Republic vigorously accelerated the three revolutions , ideological , technical and cultural , holding high the banner of the Juche idea , and thus cemented rock-firm our revolutionary base , a decisive guarantee of national reunification .  
In a sphere which was so complex at the technical level and so delicate at the political level , it was not advisable to adopt an innovative and revolutionary approach .
