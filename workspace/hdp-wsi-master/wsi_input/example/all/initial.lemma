When the salt fields were initially developed , the lagoons and sand bars at Szutsao Lake in Anping were mainly employed . Using basalt and coral rock from Penghu for dikes , the seawater was first channeled into large evaporating ponds . After initial evaporation , the briny water was channeled into small evaporating ponds where it was further concentrated , and the resulting black brine was channeled into crystallization ponds where exposure to the sun yielded crystallized salt .  
According to many environmental groups , experience with kitchen waste recycling in rural communities shows that during the initial stages , residents were unclear about what was to be recycled , and as a result kitchen wastes were provided without first draining them , or items such as stray toilet paper , chopsticks , and plastic bags were often found mixed in . This type of front-end problem with the collection system is relatively easy to correct using instruction and appropriate adjustments . The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .  
Lin still remembers that when he was in the seventh grade , tuition fees were NT $ 200 . Because his mother was unable to come up with the very substantial amount needed to pay tuition for him and his four elder brothers , she sent the children to school with NT $ 50 each , instructing them to discuss with their teachers the possibility of making an initial , partial tuition payment .

However , the modest initial steps to establish the register in 1991 were then recognized and accepted as a practical necessity since the evolutionary nature of this mechanism was abundantly clear from General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L . It was also clear at that time that there was a prescribed time-frame for ensuring the applicability of this evolution to be completed during the 1994 session of the Group of Governmental Experts which was mandated to undertake this task . 
In my initial reaction to the letter , I expressed my profound regret at the decision by the Croatian Government , as I strongly believe that the United Nations played a decisive role in bringing to a halt the brutal war on Croatian soil three years ago , and that UNPROFOR has since helped prevent a resumption of renewed fighting .  
We can , however , agree to the six-month initial period proposed in the current draft , but only on the understanding that the United Nations is not about to terminate its presence in Angola after only six months , rather , that it is prepared to undertake additional periods of extension , based on actual performance , to enable the political process to take root .

This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .

40 Given the typical characteristics of rural areas , such as sparseness of population , lack of trained personnel , low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services , it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community .

The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;

From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .

The real headache turns out to be with the downstream processes .
