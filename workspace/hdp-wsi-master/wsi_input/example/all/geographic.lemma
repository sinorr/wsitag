The southwestern region has abundant water resources , but the seasonal and geographic distribution of rainfall there is also uneven ; it is densely populated , with large mountainous areas ; its cultivated land is small in terms of per-capita area , and the soil layer is shallow ;  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
In May 1999 , it again launched the " month of recommendation for skilled persons " activities .  It had tried to recruit skilled people from all parts of the country by lifting geographic restrictions and ignoring the applicant 's social status .  From more than 500 outstanding young party and government cadres and over 500 excellent young managers in various enterprises under the direct administration of the city , it had selected 100 young administrators capable of working in large enterprise groups .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
He expressed hope that local comrades could firmly seize the present rare opportunity of the state 's large-scale development of the western region , make a full use of their advantageous geographic conditions , proceed their work from realistic conditions , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , do their work in a down-to-earth manner , and strive to bring about a faster and better economic and social development .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .

Thanks to the construction and development over the past half a century , a remarkable improvement has been registered in the overall surveying and mapping level of our army ; and the use of new and high technologies , represented by satellite positioning , remote surveying , digital mapping , and a military geographic information system , has provided a strong surveying and mapping support for the operational commanding of our army .  
It is necessary to further improve the investment environment , formulate policies that will encourage investment in geographic survey , prospecting and developing mineral resources in the western areas , guiding domestic and foreign investors to making investment in the western areas , and promoting the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of mining industries in the western areas .  
Looking ahead , Mr Cooper set out the Land Registry 's vision for the future which is to establish by 2001 a fully computerised and integrated land registration and search system that will offer convenient , speedy and cost-effective services , including central registration , guaranteed land title and a ' one-stop ' search service without geographic restrictions .  
Since ancient times , the Chinese population could broadly be divided into agricultural and nomadic sectors due to geographic and climatic diversities within the Chinese territories .  The agricultural land and pastoral areas were established south and north of the Great Wall respectively .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
We have many competitive advantages , our unique geographic location , the clustering of professionals and talents of international standing and excellent quality of our infrastructure are some of the essential ingredients for our future success .  
Based on the conditions of product distribution , geographic environment and market demands , special production areas were established to grow pineapples , bananas , oranges , grapes , and other fruits for export . The ability to compete abroad was strengthened through contracts and planned production , quality improvement , strict inspection and the encouragement of joint management for sales .  
Taiwan 's tropical and sub-tropical climate and bountiful rainfall have been favorable to the growth of trees . Because of the island 's special geographic conditions and natural environment , there are four forest zones . They vary with the elevation and temperature : the frigid , the temperate , the sub-tropical and the tropical .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services . This has caused the island 's medical standards to be , like its geographic location , quite distant from Taiwan .  
" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
These include their small size and relative geographic remoteness , a narrow range of resources , severe population stress , sometimes minimal renewable fresh water resources , and high degrees of endemism .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
This particular crisis , within a specific geographic location of strategic value and interest to the global strategy of the United States , linking United States efforts in the Viet Nam war , in which Australia was an active participant , prompted an obvious super-Power reaction , precipitating the integration of East Timor with Indonesia , in the total absence of Portugal .  
A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
The study enjoys the guidance and advice of a group of eminent persons made up of individuals of international repute and integrity drawn from every geographic region and representing a wide diversity of political , religious and cultural backgrounds ; this group also acts as a public advocate .  
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems ( GIS ) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants .  
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .

In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
Finally , I wish to express Colombia 's satisfaction at being engaged in the exemplary Central American process in the search for peace , harmony and development , through the geographic and cultural bonds that unite us to the region , the close economic and diplomatic relations that we have with every Central American country , and our participation in the Group of Friends .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
Regulators , money-laundering investigators and international policy-making bodies are facing profound challenges from a banking world which not only knows no geographic horizons and is open 24 hours a day , but is increasingly interconnected , as large transnational banks extend their reach not only through branch and subsidiary networks , but through correspondent relationships that cross the globe .  
By a note verbale dated 30 August 1996 ( A / 51 / 330-S / 1996 / 721 and Corr . 1 ) , the representative of Bulgaria transmitted to the Secretary-General a national communication on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 58 E , in which it is pointed out , inter alia , that , by virtue of its geographic location and the outward nature of its economy , Bulgaria has been extremely vulnerable to the negative side effects of the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
It should be noted , however , that economies in transition are also far from being homogenous , reflecting differences in levels of economic development , enterprise culture , infrastructural and educational base , pre-communist economic and social patterns , geographic location and most of all the degree of the use of market mechanisms prior to the change in their political systems .

Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The City and its Palestinian population have been subjected to human rights violations resulting from concerted and accelerated efforts by the Israeli authorities to create facts on the ground , such as those affecting the demographic and geographic balance in the city , which would be , if allowed to continue unabated , clearly to the advantage of its Jewish population and have negative implications for the Palestinians , placing them before a fait accompli and pre-empting their future efforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem . 
Technologies associated with space-based and terrestrial remote sensing , geographic information systems , satellite observation and communications , mathematical modelling of event scenarios , and the entire field of global communications have revolutionized the ability to monitor , analyze and disseminate accurate and timely information about natural hazards .  
While bearing in mind the global economic and political realities , which can not be ignored , the reforms should be of a holistic nature , based on equality among nations and equitable geographic distribution .  
The formula based on geographical representation shifts the emphasis of the entire reform process towards a replacement of the former ideologized bipolar world by a new bipolarity of North-South , which runs counter to a balanced perception of the objectives which have been laid out , which take into account the interests of all geographic regions .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .

In the case of UNDP , non-core resources are constituted by funds contributed by governmental or private sources and intended for specific purposes , i.e . , identified projects or programmes , or assistance within geographic or thematic areas .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
Since countries differed in terms of their living conditions , level of development , geographic characteristics and cultural traditions , there could be no uniform standard or model for solving the problems related to human settlements .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .

Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have " dualistic economies " , with the existence of great disparities between rich and poor , urban and rural areas , and central and peripheral geographic zones .  
In this respect , a negative role is played by , among other factors , the country 's particular economic structure inherited from the former Soviet Union , which is incapable of meeting the requirements of a market economy ; Tajikistan 's geographic remoteness , which has a significant detrimental effect on external economic activity ; and mountainous terrain that makes a mere 7 per cent of our country suitable for human settlement .  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
It was stressed that international efforts to assist refugees and seek solutions to their plight should be equitable and based on human need , regardless of the nationality , race , geographic , political or military importance of the refugee population .  
Despite the positive developments connected with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , economic activities had been adversely affected by a prolonged fall in living conditions , high unemployment and border closures , which led to an internal geographic separation of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
Nonetheless , it is also natural , in a democratic international community based on the principles of equitable geographic representation and the sovereign equality of States , that changes to the collective security system be the result of a genuine general agreement , instead of being imposed .  
The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban in September 1998 stressed that the expansion and reform of the Security Council must be an indivisible part of a common and complementary process that takes into account the principles of sovereign equality among States and equitable geographic distribution , as well as the need for transparency , accountability and democracy in the working methods of the Security Council , including decision-making therein .

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
The Panel considers that a geographic limitation is implied in the requirement that safety equipment is only compensable if it is reasonable in relation to the type of risk to which the individual and or property is exposed , namely that only protective measures taken within a specific geographical area will be compensated .

He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
In May 1999 , it again launched the " month of recommendation for skilled persons " activities .  It had tried to recruit skilled people from all parts of the country by lifting geographic restrictions and ignoring the applicant 's social status .  From more than 500 outstanding young party and government cadres and over 500 excellent young managers in various enterprises under the direct administration of the city , it had selected 100 young administrators capable of working in large enterprise groups .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .

Since ancient times , the Chinese population could broadly be divided into agricultural and nomadic sectors due to geographic and climatic diversities within the Chinese territories .  The agricultural land and pastoral areas were established south and north of the Great Wall respectively .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
We have many competitive advantages , our unique geographic location , the clustering of professionals and talents of international standing and excellent quality of our infrastructure are some of the essential ingredients for our future success .  
Based on the conditions of product distribution , geographic environment and market demands , special production areas were established to grow pineapples , bananas , oranges , grapes , and other fruits for export . The ability to compete abroad was strengthened through contracts and planned production , quality improvement , strict inspection and the encouragement of joint management for sales .  
Taiwan 's tropical and sub-tropical climate and bountiful rainfall have been favorable to the growth of trees . Because of the island 's special geographic conditions and natural environment , there are four forest zones . They vary with the elevation and temperature : the frigid , the temperate , the sub-tropical and the tropical .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services .

" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago .

It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
Taumi is located about five kilometers southwest of Puli Township , at the entrance to Sun Moon Lake . It borders University Pond , a 400-hectare body of water where lilies grow in abundance . National Chi Nan University is located here , and the town has the appealing nickname of " doctorate village " among folks in Nantou County . In sum , it enjoys an outstanding geographic position and excellent human and cultural resources .  
" Besides the climatic and geographic advantages , this area has a unique background in terms of human history , " states Chen Chung . If hundreds of years ago Chinese had not flooded into Taiwan and occupied all the lowlying land , the Aboriginal peoples would never have been forced to move to high altitudes . When the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 , overnight the island was flooded with two million refugees and soldiers , creating an immediate shortage of arable land , and spawning an urgent need for development in the mountains .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
These include their small size and relative geographic remoteness , a narrow range of resources , severe population stress , sometimes minimal renewable fresh water resources , and high degrees of endemism .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .
