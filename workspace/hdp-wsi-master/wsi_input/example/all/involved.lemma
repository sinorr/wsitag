With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .

In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .

In essence , the work involved in the first breakthrough is to safeguard the economic interests of workers and staff members with material difficulties .

As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .

No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .

The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
According to an authoritative personality in Beijing who is involved in Taiwan affairs , the meeting held that Chen Shui-bian lacked sincerity and deliberately evaded the one-China principle in the inaugural speech and that the sense of Taiwan independence exposed and the language used in the speech are disappointing and we should heighten our vigilance .  The keynote of Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech is dissatisfactory and unacceptable to the mainland .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification .

The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .

My main work at the center has involved taking on psychological counseling cases , and serving as a group leader of empathy and self-affirmation groups , and emotional management groups for single-parent elementary school students . Accompanying people through their low times and sharing life experiences with them is a hard-to-come-by opportunity in this age when people lack ties to others .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
This academic debate not only revolved around objective evidence , but also involved national sentiments and encroached on the academic turf of various researchers . This has always been a highly sensitive area , so perhaps it is not surprising that for a while a fierce battle of words raged .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?  
Not long ago , pop star Chang Yu-sheng was involved in a serious car accident . When he reached the hospital , he was pronounced dead on arrival . Had there been a trained professional there when he had his accident , he might have been saved .  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
Volunteer organizations , on the other hand , took aim at people 's desire to " do some good " and arranged even more volunteer activities for them . Meanwhile , the continuing education departments of many universities scheduled additional weekend classes . Figures involved in athletics were also excited , seeing the two extra Saturdays a month as an opportunity to finally begin building the sort of " athletic pyramid " that all the major sporting nations have .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
" We men are very lonely inside and need opportunities for growth and exchange , " says resident Chang Chih-pin , a physics instructor at Hung Kuang Institute of Technology . He used to be introverted and taciturn , but after moving here and getting involved in management committee work , he has been molded by his fellow committee members ' soft and maternal ways , and has gradually opened up .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
I met my husband during high school , when we were both involved in organizing extracurricular activities . After our wedding , we headed off together to the United States for graduate school at Cornell University , but I subsequently learned that I 'm not the right type to work for a PhD . Given the disciplinary division in Western academics , the doctoral scope is too narrow for my broad range of interests .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts . Some plan to get involved in social movements or to seek public office themselves . As far as they are concerned , these leadership camps are basic training in political participation .  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang-tzu . As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
According to Gu Weiqin , another relative involved with the running of Mingda , " The only advantage for Mingda was that Yangzhou University had been around for a long time and had a very good reputation . A diploma from Yangzhou University carried considerable cachet , and was more attractive to students . A graduate from the Chinese Department of Fudan University in Shanghai , Gu Weiqin is a former department head at a vocational school in Nanchang , capital of Jiangxi Province .  
" Being involved in a social movement taught me that , at their core , most social problems come down to the fundamental character of human beings . So having been part of an organized movement , having worked within a group , I 've gone back to the beginning and am looking at myself . " Even as a child , Chen was introspective and given to challenging anything she perceived as unfair .  
" If we 're going to be in this game we have to be in at the forefront , " says Chen Ming-tang , who joined the AMiBA program after being involved in SMART . He spent the whole of last year designing and thinking about the new project .

To achieve this , CGCG has specially developed a production management system that breaks down the tasks involved in producing each scene into different categories . Designers are responsible for designing the characters , animators are responsible for adding movements , and other processes such as adding color , lighting and special effects are also handled by specialists . All these tasks are conducted simultaneously to reduce the amount of time needed to complete the project .  
In 1992 , Chiku Township began planning an industrial park in this area . Conservationists fought the initiative and eventually built a national consensus to " set aside a piece of pristine land for the black-faced spoonbills . " The birds ' nesting grounds were thus preserved , and scholars gradually began to get involved in research and conservation .  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Helen studied at the Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology but did not graduate , or go on to serve in the medical field . Instead she became involved in sales , and over the course of many years of fair and honest dealing she accumulated a large number of business connections , which serves as a resource for her work rescuing abandoned animals .  
Language initially posed a problem , because these children , having grown up in Germany , whether of mixed German-Chinese parentage or pure Chinese , were not necessarily very competent in Chinese , with levels of ability differing widely . The teachers brought over from Taiwan , on the other hand , could n't speak German . Yet , while verbal communication was only intermittently successful , the subjects involved mainly " do what I do " types of activities , so the language problem did not prove too serious .  
At this , the TRA immediately ceased using the aluminum boxes , moving on to stainless steel ones . However , the costs involved with using stainless steel boxes were higher , meaning they could only offer them on the seat-bookable and deluxe expresses , while passengers on the basic and express trains were sold lunches in the old fiberboard boxes .  
In the region threatened by bird flu , Taiwan alone has remained clean . There have been sporadic outbreaks of fowl pest around the island , but thus far they have all involved the less pathogenic and less virulent H5N2 virus strain , which does not infect humans . This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
Danger can be divided into two categories : perceived risk and objective risk . Wu Kuan-chang , exploration aficionado and a student in the doctoral program in Leisure Behavior at Indiana University 's Department of Recreation and Park Administration , points out that people 's anxieties about mountaineering and other adventure activities are primarily subjective perceptions of risk . In fact many studies from abroad indicate that the risk of injury while engaging in these kinds of activities is much lower than the risks involved in playing many ball sports .  
Really only modernized countries have the conditions for pro sports , " says Hsu Sheng-ming , head coach of both the Chinatrust Whales and the Chinese Taipei Olympic baseball squad , sharing his profound understanding of the game today . And he should know-he got involved in professional baseball as a coach in 1990 at the age of 32 and has been with professional baseball all along the way ever since .

Diabetes was the fourth leading cause of death in Taiwan last year , and is a contributing cause of strokes ( the number-two killer ) , cardiovascular disease ( ranking third ) , and kidney dysfunction ( tenth ) . To be more exact , diabetes is directly or indirectly involved in more than half the fatalities due to the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan .  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .

We know how difficult was the road leading to the establishment of lasting peace in view of the level of distrust and the acute , accumulated suffering involved .  
The difficulties involved in meeting , living together and working as equals in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation can not conceal the important contribution being made today by the leaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of President Mandela , to whom we wish to accord a special recognition for having constructed the democratic foundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation , fully incorporated into the international community . 
Despite this solemn commitment , some of those involved in political life , manipulated from abroad , are trying desperately to hoodwink national and international public opinion by saying that the Government are responsible for delaying the votes .  
The United Nations agencies involved in the entire range of processes covered under this omnibus goal should ensure that their activities are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular the sovereign equality and political independence of States , territorial integrity , and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .

The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
With regard to governance issues , national institutions and professionals from the public and private sectors , grass-roots organizations and political parties have been actively involved in discussions , round-table meetings and national conferences on governance issues , constitutional and legal reforms , etc . alongside high calibre international experts and consultants .

The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
Demands that those involved immediately cease those outrageous acts , which are in gross violation of international humanitarian law , including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949-7 / and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , 8 / and take immediate action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with their obligations under those instruments and other applicable international human rights instruments ;

Rules that affect the operation of the court to this degree will require careful effort to draft , for they must be acceptable and workable in the light of the widely varying national legal systems involved .  
Create and modify programmes and policies that recognize and strengthen women 's vital role in food security and provide paid and unpaid women producers , especially those involved in food production , such as farming , fishing and aquaculture as well as urban enterprises , with equal access to appropriate technologies , transportation , extension services , marketing and credit facilities at the local and community levels ;  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
Other delegations felt that that possibility should only be available to States parties that had a clear interest in the case , such as the territorial State , the custodial State or the State of nationality of the victim or suspect , to avoid the substantial costs involved in a lengthy investigation in response to frivolous , politically motivated or unsubstantiated complaints .  
Some delegations felt that the question of the statute of limitations for the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court should be addressed in the statute in the light of divergencies between national laws and bearing in mind the importance of the legal principle involved , which reflected the decreasing social importance of bringing criminals to justice and the increasing difficulties in ensuring a fair trial as time elapsed .  
The duty imposed on the Prosecutor in paragraph 1 raised once again the difficulties involved in reconciling the respective responsibilities of the international criminal court and those of national authorities .  
UNDP-supported preparatory work for the World Summit for Social Development has involved country-level briefings , workshops and special events ; enabling the production of national reports and position papers ; and active participation at regional and global conferences on the core subjects involved .  
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
The frequent appearance of corpses in the so-called " graveyard " bearing signs of torture and coups de grace , the fact that the victims are frequently common criminals , and the inability of the competent national agencies to locate the perpetrators , are characteristic of the modus operandi of the organized groups involved in " social cleansing " campaigns , which can hardly operate without the tolerance , complicity or direct participation of agents of the State .  
The Mission believes that URNG has committed human rights violations and has failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population , by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting the " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines or explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
The lack of concrete progress in the political process and , which is even more serious , with regard to the cease-fire , the lack of harmonization in the policies and efforts of all the parties involved and the unfortunate continuation of the flow of arms to the country have now made it necessary to make international support conditional on the existence of real , concrete political will among the parties peacefully to resolve their differences and achieve national reconciliation .  
While agreeing with the need for Headquarters to become more involved in validating the aircraft requirements of all missions , the Field Administration and Logistics Division stated that " since this recommendation would involve a major policy initiative , and would consequently entail a comprehensive review , we believe it more judicious to reserve our specific comments in this regard , pending the outcome of a complete evaluation " . 
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .

The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Given the substantial financial implications involved in the current arrangements for additional war-risk insurance , referred to in paragraph 24 ( a ) ( ii ) , alternative arrangements should be sought with the utmost expediency ;  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
In many instances they were headed by or under the patronage of the Head of State or Government , or the first lady of the country ; were established at the senior governmental level ; and often involved several national ministries , with the ministry or authority devoted to family issues , where it existed , usually assuming the lead role .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .

Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
Iraq 's cooperation , including the provision of accurate information and supporting documentation , access to personnel involved in the relevant activities and support of the Commission 's inspection and monitoring efforts will be required , on a continuous basis , in order to enable the Commission to achieve this objective in a speedy and efficient manner .  
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
But a lot more needs to be learned : the numbers involved world wide , their geographical distribution , their precise needs , how they are being met and by whom , the status of the internally displaced in international law , and the adequacy of the coverage through existing international institutional arrangements for their protection and assistance .

Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,

economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .

As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
We would like to emphasize , however in accordance with statements made by the Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference recently held in Chile that it is our position that the problems of that region must be solved in accordance with the constructive spirit of the agreements concluded between the parties involved , while protecting the legitimate rights of all the inhabitants and guaranteeing access to holy places , in full respect of international law .

Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution .

Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .

During the period in question , the 411 complaints admitted fell into the following categories : ( a ) torture ( 6.3 per cent ) , an appalling practice which the administrative measures taken against certain officials involved in such cases have not managed to eradicate completely ; ( b ) cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ( 19.2 per cent ) ; ( c ) excessive use of force ( 3.4 per cent ) ; and ( d ) other threats ( 71.1 per cent ) .  
The conduct now of this review , not only of the minimum backstopping requirements but of how best to fund the support account , is also necessary in the context of harmonizing support account requirements with the new budgetary cycle for peace-keeping operations , which covers a 12-month period from July of one year to June of the next year , starting in 1996 .  NULLThe Secretary-General has conducted and completed a comprehensive " bottom-up " review of backstopping requirements of Headquarters departments and offices involved , in the light of recent and prospective changes in peace-keeping operations .

The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .

The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .

Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities , sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly where State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , innovative privatization plans should be devised so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions previously performed ;  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .

It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .

A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
Even if the actors involved in our region had doubts as to the true intentions of the new Burundian authorities , the negotiations required a minimum period of time devoted to specifying negotiable points , to approving an agenda , to determining practical modalities , to identifying negotiators and to the forming of the delegations of the various groups that are parties to the conflict .

Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
Educating people about how to save water , setting high efficiency standards for domestic appliances and charging realistic water rates were the main mechanisms involved , and were mirrored by federal legislation that established water as an economic commodity rather than a free good .

The Child Protection Code , promulgated by an Act signed in November 1995 , provides specific follow-up to that general policy , with a view to securing the necessary balance between the imperatives of social prevention and the necessities of legal protection , thereby rendering intervention by the various social , educational and legal parties and structures involved in the protection of children effective .  
It would be wholly unrealistic and even irresponsible to believe that , following the 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of between 500,000 and 1-million persons and involved substantial destruction of Rwanda 's infrastructure as well as ensuing instability and violence arising from continuing insurgency and counter-insurgency operations , anything less than sustained remedial efforts can bring about long-lasting improvement in the human rights situation .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
They should also be charged with raising funds ; channelling international and regional inputs , information and support to the local and grass-roots levels in their respective countries and coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade ; and reporting to the High Commissioner on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade .

As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .  
The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
For all those reasons , and in view of its previous request for the strengthening of support to the Committee , made at its fourth session it expressed its willingness to be involved in future consultations with the Secretariat to ensure the optimal use of available resources and the effective performance of its functions , in the light of article 43 , paragraph 11 of the Convention .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and micro-topographical data of the Area ;  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
With respect to working methods , his delegation supported the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should adopt a flexible approach involving both codification of international law ( inasmuch as fundamental human rights were involved ) and its progressive development ( as far as matters of succession of States were concerned ) .  
Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
A prerequisite for the smooth functioning of information exchange during the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly is the designation , by all Parties involved in AIJ , of the relevant governmental authority or ministry authorized to accept , approve or endorse activities implemented jointly and to report on them to the Conference of the Parties through the secretariat ( FCCC / SBSTA / 1996 / 8 , para .  NULL  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,

The financial liability involved in the acceptance of gratis personnel relates to costs for secretarial and administrative backstopping , equipment , supplies , office space , utilities , communications , legal and medical services , as well as costs for official travel , daily subsistence allowance and participation in United Nations training and language programmes .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Moreover , it wished to point out that the fifth preambular paragraph seriously misquoted the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights ; that , contrary to the statement in operative paragraph 3 , nothing in the international human rights instruments precluded the adoption of sanctions under domestic law ; that paragraph 4 wrongly implied that the right to self-determination included a right to trade and economic relations ; and that paragraph 5 incorrectly involved the Commission on Human Rights in issues of trade and economics .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .

Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
Panama recognizes and respects international humanitarian law and shares the will of States to establish mechanisms designed to promote and strengthen the rights of the child , in this case focusing on children who , voluntarily or not , are involved in acts of war and become the obvious victims or silent witnesses of such events , which have pervasive effects on their physical , social and family lives .  
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
The Centre for Human Rights , as well as relevant specialized agencies and international programmes , will explore possibilities for the development and use of advanced technologies , including telecommunications networks , electronic mail databases and data exchange to facilitate networking among international programmes , national focal points , educators and resource and training centres involved in the Decade .

His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,

In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Against this background , allow me to defend the global approach which offers us the advantage of being more rational because it avoids piecemeal perceptions , wiser because it allows for the establishment of the balances necessary in any negotiations , and finally fairer because it does not marginalize anyone ; quite the contrary , it rejects measures that are not lasting and calculations that are narrow and brings all those involved together in the same creative synergy . 
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The Committee recommends that special protection measures be adopted and implemented in relation to children living and / or working in the street , children in conflict with the law , in particular those deprived of liberty , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , abused and exploited children and children involved with child labour .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
The chain reaction provoked by that decision to open an archaeological tunnel passing under the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex should have been an important lesson for all the parties involved on what not to do at this critical point in time when , significantly , not only the future of Al-Quds Al-Sharif , but also the future of the entire Middle East peace process hangs in the balance .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .

Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
While the warring parties have shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it is noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans have taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who are not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
Resources required would specifically maintain a core capability , allowing the Base to fulfil essential functions , handling rapid surges of activity through the provision of temporary additional resources drawn from the budgets of the closing or new missions involved .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The source reported that in late 1993 , the appeal division of the Supreme Court barred further habeas corpus applications and ruled that in light of the special circumstances and the seriousness of the crimes involved , the SPO detainees were to remain incarcerated without any specific time limit , until they were charged .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
France , which was involved in the creation of the Tribunal from the beginning , France , whose army paid a heavy price in the service of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 70 dead , 700 wounded was deeply shocked by recent statements in the press questioning the conduct of States participating in the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) in the implementation of the Tribunal 's decisions . 
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
In addition , even though the Government is divesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging greater private investment in vital services and commodities , there are some areas , particularly those surrounding technology , in which the Government has to remain directly involved and catalytic ; it will continue with its practice of seeking consensus on determining key industries and activities crucial and critical for development . 
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
These experiments are aimed at laying the practical foundations for enabling human beings to spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of space flight ( studies on radiation safety , strain on the human support and locomotive system , determination of the mechanisms involved in vestibular disorders and changes in the cardiovascular system , and development of methods for their prevention or treatment ) .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
The sponsors and executive entities of , and the research teams involved in , the above-mentioned surveys agreed that there was a need for more coordination and complementarity in applying the experiences and the results of the surveys , in order to enhance the understanding of crime and criminal justice processes at the international as well as at the national and local levels .  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
IASC has agreed that simple field-based monitoring systems should be established in all complex emergency situations in which the United Nations system is involved in order to facilitate accountability , to optimize utilization of resources , to avoid duplication of effort and to adapt to changing circumstances .  The establishment of the system will be an inter _ agency effort carried out under the leadership of the resident / humanitarian coordinator .  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
A view widely shared by Governments was that the formulation of effective recommendations for action had to be based on a solid understanding of the various aspects of international migration and development , and on reliable information regarding the multifaceted experience of the countries involved in the international migration process .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
Invites the regional commissions , the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , government-appointed national correspondents in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice , specialized agencies and other entities within the United Nations system , the intergovernmental organizations concerned and relevant non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to become actively involved in the preparations for the Tenth Congress ;  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
UNDCP held two meetings , in June and October 1997 , with its regional advisers and chief technical advisers involved at the field level in key alternative development projects .  
These seminars have been intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials _ judicial , administrative , military and law enforcement _ involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The purpose of the Social Incentive Fund is to provide a comprehensive and concerted approach at the local level to the numerous problems involved in improvement of the urban living environment .  
No internal control structure , however detailed and comprehensive , can by itself guarantee efficient administration and complete and accurate records or be foolproof against fraud , especially when those involved hold positions of authority or trust .  
Tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries encounter considerable difficulties in understanding the controversial taxation issues involved in , for example , transfer pricing mechanisms and innovative financial instruments .  
ECA has developed extensive collaborative relationships with the various global entities , regional and subregional organizations involved in economic and social development in Africa .  
In accordance with commonly accepted national and international criteria , these indicators should be relevant , simple and measurable , and due account should be taken of the difficulties involved in measuring the impact of analytical work .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
UNDCP has three main sources of expertise : its own internal experts appointed on permanent or fixed-term contracts ; national and international institutions involved in drug-related issues ; and independent consultants .  
In accordance with commonly accepted national and international criteria , these indicators should be relevant , simple and measurable , and due account should be taken of the difficulties involved in measuring the impact of analytical work .  
In accordance with commonly accepted national and international criteria , these indicators should be relevant , simple and measurable , and due account should be taken of the difficulties involved in measuring the impact of analytical work .  
They included , for example , poverty , gender discrimination and the difficulties faced by children in need of special protection , whether institutionalized , living in the streets , involved in armed conflicts or substance abuse , exploited and abused , etc .  
International investment agreements ( IIAs ) have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment with a view to attracting foreign direct investment which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved .  
Most IIAs _ and particularly BITs _ have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment , with a view towards promoting and protecting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved . 
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
In pursuing a comprehensive model of preventive action , UNPREDEP has also been involved in a wide range of programmes related to good governance and the rule of law , strengthening of national capacity and infrastructure , institution - building and human resources development in the governmental and civil sectors .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .  
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
The crisis had proved difficult to manage , partly because of its rapid spread to other countries , but more importantly because the usual prescriptions had either proved ineffective or would have involved a much longer transition , which would have caused greater losses of output and social distress .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
Such negative attitudes often lead to passive or hidden discrimination against migrants , and recourse to civil remedies is constrained by the difficulty of proving formal violation of rights and the financial cost involved in the legal procedures .  
With regard to budgetary allocations , the judiciary requested 750-million quetzales for fiscal year 1999 , based largely on the needs involved in the implementation of its modernization plan ; the executive branch assigned it 366.5-million quetzales in the regular budget .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall27 establish as criminal offences28 the following conduct :  
This process involved not only the execution of suspected individuals within the leadership of each unit ( including many members of the Government and the Central Committee of the Party ) , but also the repeated wholesale arrest and killing of all of the Party cadres in a unit considered treacherous , such as a particular sector or military division .  
In 1998 , IPU published a model code of conduct for elections13 which acknowledges that a successful and informed electoral process is the joint responsibility of all involved : political parties and candidates ; supporters and voters ; police and security forces ; Governments and public officials ; media and observers .  
The view was also expressed that the scientific and technical aspects of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be studied in order to develop further the legal issues involved , especially in relation to collisions between nuclear-powered objects and space debris .  
The Economic and Social Council now holds a series of high-level segments , with ministerial participation , requiring the General Service staff to be involved in providing extensive technical services to ensure the smooth running and efficient functioning of those meetings .  
Recognizing also the complexity of the issues involved , the diversity of the views expressed and the need to discuss them in a careful , detailed , inclusive , transparent and integrated manner with a view to reaching a consensus on these issues within a reasonable time _ frame ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate successfully and , in particular , to provide him with adequate staff based in those territories to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries of the mandate and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;  
The synergies and economies of scale involved in co-location and shared services are well known , however , the institutional constraints , particularly those of the specialized agencies located in Geneva with independent governing bodies and in many cases a long history pre-dating the United Nations , are considerable .  
This participation allowed me to witness ( and now bear witness to ) the very thorough and pragmatic drafting process in a superbly selected group , with representatives of all interested sectors actively involved in standby letter of credit practice such as : bankers , especially those responsible for letter of credit operations and global trade transactions , bank counsel , attorneys , academics , regulators , government officials , corporate treasurers , and likely influential beneficiaries .  
Recognizing also the complexity of the issues involved , the diversity of the views expressed and the need to discuss them in a careful , detailed , inclusive , transparent and integrated manner , with a view to reaching consensus on these issues as soon as possible within a reasonable time _ frame ,  
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;  
It observes with the deepest concern that guerrilla activities continue to be directed against civilians ( in particular the totally unacceptable practice of hostage _ taking under the threat of death among nationals or foreigners who are neither personally involved in nor responsible for the conflict or its conduct ) and attacks on infrastructure , including the bombing of pipelines , which have caused numerous deaths , great suffering amongst the civilian population and grave destruction .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of means of diversion from ordinary criminal justice proceedings and mediation policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
It is essential that this future body , whose governing board will comprise the various sectors of civil society involved and whose role will be of key importance in developing space sciences within the country and in familiarizing coming generations with the issues of sustainable socio-economic development , should be strengthened as from its establishment through the cooperation of Member States .  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
It will continue to cooperate fully over the coming years , as it has done in connection with the preparations for this Conference , in order to ensure that the results achieved with regard to the main economic , social and cultural interests involved in the use of outer space can be applied for the benefit of all .  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
The Advisory Group wishes to express its deep gratitude to all the entities at the multilateral and bilateral levels involved in assisting Haiti in completing its task , in particular the World Bank , the office of the representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti , and the office of the resident coordinator in Haiti .  
There must be no misunderstanding : here we are dealing with apparently simple principles which require those involved in education to strike out in genuinely new directions , either in order to take a concept of education that is still too narrow and individualistic and open it up to universal values or in order to take an education that is too universalist or ideological and refocus it on the human person .  
In the Belgian language case , for example , the [ European ] Court [ of Human Rights ] , referring to the preparatory work involved in the negotiation of the First Protocol , commented that only religious convictions were intended ; the term ' philosophical ' had been added to the term ' religious ' only in order to cover opinions that were not consistent with religious thinking or teaching , such as agnostic or atheistic convictions .  
For example , guidelines for interviews recently prepared for the Kosovo emergency operation and shared with the partners involved in the field refer to both economic , social and cultural and civil and political rights .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
Following the rejection of the constitutional reforms in the national referendum on 16 May , the Follow-up Commission , a body established under the peace agreements with the authority to reschedule the parties commitments , has dedicated its attention to developing a viable peace agenda , which would enable the completion of the third phase of the timetable , in consultation with those sectors of civil society that are directly involved in the implementation process .  
This silence is alarming inasmuch as there are situations in which a countrys press reports in abundant detail on the presence of companies involved in matters of national security and public safety without regard for human rights and in open contradiction with constitutional provisions that categorically state that internal order and security are the exclusive responsibility of the State .  
The representative further stated that it would be a great misfortune for the defenders of human rights if a precedent was set whereby any non-governmental organization involved in a technical-procedural error was to be punished unduly on the basis of one specific case .  
The meeting concluded that successful gender mainstreaming is more likely to take place in countries where responsibility for it is not located in a single governmental body and where civil society is actively involved in advancing gender-equality issues .  
In collecting information during the four visits for the preparation of the present report , meetings were held with a wide range of personalities from various sectors of Rwandan society : branches of the Government , civil society , members of diplomatic missions and members of United Nations agencies , as well as with some national and international non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) involved in human rights and related matters in Rwanda .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .  IOM is involved in all phases of mass exoduses , providing technical and operational expertise in such areas as transportation , health , and other services for migrants .  
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
From traditional society to our modern world with its elaborate written laws , it has always been understood that persons who are not involved in combat during an armed conflict should not be subject to attack .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .  
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
My Government makes a solemn and emotional appeal to the entire international community in general , and to the Security Council in particular , inviting them to become fully involved in the immediate implementation of the Lusaka Agreement so as to put an end to the untold suffering of my people .  
Recognizing the continuing efforts of debtor countries , despite the great social cost involved , to pursue economic reform , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes aimed at achieving stability , raising domestic savings and investments , reducing inflation , improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development , including the eradication of poverty as well as the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations ,  
The risks involved for lenders included ( a ) the difficulty in forecasting traffic and determining what amount of tolls users would be prepared to pay ; ( b ) the fact that users usually paid in domestic currency , so that foreign investors faced a currency mismatch between their investment and their cash-flow return ; and ( c ) the risk that municipalities would change the tolls to please their constituency , in particular before elections .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
National , regional and international efforts to find solutions to economic and social problems and to resolve conflicts must be increased if women were to be effectively involved in sustainable national development .  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity .

With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .

Shortly afterwards , the local public security organs at all levels downloaded all sorts of information relating to the prime suspect from a specialized website created by the Ministry of Public Security , so that the broad masses of public security officers and men involved in this struggle quickly learned all details and accurate information relating to the prime suspect and information relating to investigations into the case as well , and this provided solid support for cracking the vicious " 16 March " explosion case in Shijiazhuang City .  
In addition , many of the more than 1,000 enterprise managers being involved in the survey held that practices that violated the established regulations and rules for still occurred from time to time when the administrative departments dealt with enterprises .

After our WTO entry , China , as a member country of the World Trade Organization , will enjoy multilateral , unconditional and stable most-favored nation treatment .  When we become involved in a trade dispute involving agriculture products , we can rely on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to reach a more fair and reasonable solution , and this will reduce such unfair treatment as non-tariff restrictions aimed at Chinese agricultural exports by other countries .  
In those major cases of smuggling , tax fraud , producing and selling fake products , and other economic crimes that have been solved , we can all see those corrupt elements , and in some cases there are even government officials and grassroots level cadres who are directly involved in producing and selling fake products .

The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
Judging from relevant reports , the diplomats played a negotiator role over the counter , and military leaders such as Chi Haotian and Jiefangjun Bao acted in an organized and planned manner , but not , as reported by some US mainstream media , that " Chinese generals " were asked not to get involved and not to be that tough .  
This reporter has learned from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation that between 1981 and 1999 , Japan has provided uncompensated funds to China in the total amount of over 120-billion yen , which account for more than one-half of the total amount of aid funds granted in gratis to China by various countries , to finance nearly 100 projects involved in medical treatment , agriculture , poverty relief , environmental protection , education , and so on .

In its editorial entitled " Serious Consequences of US Arms Sales to Taiwan , " Wen Wei Po pointed out that it is both wrong and dangerous for the United States to be continuously selling arms and equipment to Taiwan , especially when the weapons sold are more and more sophisticated and the sums involved are larger and larger .  
As expected , soon after the editorial was published , Tsai Ing-wen announced on 16 April to the outside world : " The report submitted by the Mainland Affairs Council to the Executive Yuan on the issue of revising the policy of ' no haste , restraint ' will have to revised with the factor of economic changes taken into account .

US President Bush recently issued a series of tough statements regarding cross-strait affairs and US support for Taiwan . In the wake of these statements , Communist China 's authoritative personages in charge of Taiwan affairs said that Communist China 's high-ranking personnel are paying close attention to the future actions on the part of the United States . If the United States continues getting involved in cross-strait affairs , Communist China might be forced to resolve the Taiwan issue ahead of its schedule by resorting to tough means .  
Of the " five breakthroughs and one enhancement , " the first breakthrough stresses the trade union 's work of assisting party and government organizations in guaranteeing the basic livelihood of laid-off workers and staff members , conducting in-depth warmth-sending projects , and carrying out the " primary responsible person 's " duty to help those workers and staff members who have serious difficulties in everyday life .  In essence , the work involved in the first breakthrough is to safeguard the economic interests of workers and staff members with material difficulties .  
It should be emphasized that the " five breakthroughs and one enhancement " form an integral whole .

They have speedily launched their special actions to crack down on guns and drugs .

To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .

First , as " the Le-cheng Program " is a highly confidential program involving top secrets , Taiwan 's military has had to implement the program without mentioning it in public , and Taiwan 's officers and men involved in the program also know very little about it .  As Taiwan 's media have of late published a series of unfavorable reports on " the Le-cheng Program " , Taiwan 's top brass are concerned that the public will not support the program .  
Similarly , it is impossible for Hong Kong to turn a blind eye to Falungong , which has been increasingly involved in political and international affairs and has disturbed the normal living order of citizens .  The HKSAR Government must assume responsibility for the security and stability of Hong Kong . Hence , the government 's stance and methods are totally reasonable and necessary .

Some people , although knowing that someone did something wrong , pretend not to know anything and keep one eye closed .  
Ferreting out the " protective umbrella " of underworld and evil forces should be perceived as a major content of the current drive of investigating and handling on-the-job crimes , as an emphasis of the work in deeply promoting the anti-corruption campaign , and as an important content of the work in examining and approving the arrests of criminals and in examining lawsuits .  No matter what unit and what persons are involved , all cases must be investigated thoroughly regardless of obstructions so that the evil forces can be rooted out .  
All levels of discipline inspection and supervision organs and all cadres involved in the discipline inspection and supervision work must have an in-depth understanding of the scientific content of the major thinking of the " Three Represents , " implement the " Three Represents " requirements in the entire process of the discipline inspection and supervision work , further intensify the party work style building and clean administration building and the anti-corruption work , and constantly score new results in the anti-corruption work and in the promotion of clean administration building .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
The exceptionally large smuggling case recently cracked in Xiamen is among the worst smuggling cases ever handled ever since the founding of New China , for it involved an immense amount of money , showed complicated details , did severe harm to society , and left extremely bad impressions ; and the problems exposed in the case have proved a shock to the public .

Those involved in serious cases should be brought to justice .  
Now that the CSCC has decided to place on file for investigation and prosecution both the Sanjiu Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Company Ltd . and the people involved in its irregularities , circulating a notice criticizing the relevant law-violation and rule-violation behaviors , this has signaled a major move made by China 's securities control authorities aimed at restructuring listed companies in terms of management , and has demonstrated China 's securities control authorities ' firm resolve in ruthlessly cracking down on irregularities in the stock market as well .

Early this year , Hu Changqing , ex-deputy governor of Jiangxi Province , was sentenced to death for extensively taking and demanding large bribes , thereby becoming the highest ranking official sentenced to death for corruption in China since the 1960s .  
Ever since 1992 , however , along with the arrival of a new round of high tides in the country 's business operation and amidst drastic changes in the social structure , the country 's original interest setup was smashed ; and during the redistribution process of new interests , corruption has also taken on new features , as corrupt elements are committing their crimes by forming groups , corrupt practices are found among officials of increasingly higher ranks , and corruption cases have involved huge amounts of money .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .

The part of cross-strait relations in the new Taiwan leader 's inaugural speech superficially looked mild and prudent in words and phrases and involved no hackneyed and stereotyped expressions openly advocating " Taiwan independence . "  However , if we read this speech more carefully , it will not be difficult for us to find that this new leader did not make any concession on the issues related to principles , did not free himself from the keynotes of " the two-state theory , " and stubbornly adhered to the stance on " Taiwan independence . "  
According to an authoritative personality in Beijing who is involved in Taiwan affairs , the meeting held that Chen Shui-bian lacked sincerity and deliberately evaded the one-China principle in the inaugural speech and that the sense of Taiwan independence exposed and the language used in the speech are disappointing and we should heighten our vigilance .  The keynote of Chen Shui-bian 's inaugural speech is dissatisfactory and unacceptable to the mainland .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .

At a summit meeting held in mid-June in ( Fila , ) Portugal , a heated debate erupted between Britain and both Germany and France over expanding the agenda of government-to-government meeting on EU 's structural reform and over the issue of " strengthening cooperation mechanism " within the scope of the " Amsterdam Treaty " .

The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .

A person in charge of the Guangdong provincial industrial and commercial administration bureau said : From January to July this year , the industrial and commercial administration departments across the province listed a total of 37 cases of illegal MLM for investigation and handling and dispersed 3.28 million people involved in MLM .  
It is essential to intensify the investigation and handling of cases , and resolutely investigate and deal with cases of bartering power for money , and conniving at , protecting , and participating in smuggling , and cases of heavy losses caused to the state by serious dereliction of duty ; the leaders as well as those directly involved must be held accountable .  
As officials responsible for " security of their own area , " the party committees and government at all levels should frequently concern themselves with the progress of the investigation and handling of the contradictions and disputes .  Regarding the major contradictions and outstanding problems that might affect social stability , they should personally get involved , go deep into the realities of life , do well meticulous ideological and political work , seriously mitigate the contradictions , and resolve the problems .  
As officials directly responsible for maintaining social stability , the leading comrades responsible for political and legal work and for comprehensive management of social order should vigorously organize and coordinate with all the departments concerned , share the work with individual responsibility , pool efforts , create a situation of everyone getting involved in the work , and promote the investigation and handling of contradictions and disputes .

Rarely did any of the previous US presidents make it so clear on the issue .  In particular , Bush Junior holds a more conservative attitude toward getting involved in international affairs , while Gore is more active in terms of getting involved in the maintenance of the international order .

Over a certain period , the layout of pharmaceutical wholesale and retail enterprises was improper .

The special struggle arranged by the Ministry of Public Security against criminal syndicates and evil forces has produced initial success ; we must unremittingly pay close attention to it to completely root out criminal syndicates and evil forces in all localities .

"

The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily .

Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated .

Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music .

"

Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch .

Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
Haruyama 's philosophy in fact is simply a more rational form of a very popular current wave of thinking in Taiwan-the individualism of Taiwan 's so-called " new youth , " who refuse to get involved in the public sphere and who extol the idea that " as long as it makes me happy , there 's nothing wrong with it . "  
This academic debate not only revolved around objective evidence , but also involved national sentiments and encroached on the academic turf of various researchers . This has always been a highly sensitive area , so perhaps it is not surprising that for a while a fierce battle of words raged .  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased .

When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?

Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
Volunteer organizations , on the other hand , took aim at people 's desire to " do some good " and arranged even more volunteer activities for them . Meanwhile , the continuing education departments of many universities scheduled additional weekend classes . Figures involved in athletics were also excited , seeing the two extra Saturdays a month as an opportunity to finally begin building the sort of " athletic pyramid " that all the major sporting nations have .  
An ad hoc task force comprising both civilian and military investigators is now hard at work on the case , but has discovered signs that many documents have either been lost or falsified . Many worrisome questions remain unanswered : How many people are involved ? How high up does the case reach ?  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
People found the case even more startling not only because had it occurred in a staid seat of higher learning , but also because all those involved came from backgrounds which did not suggest criminality or licence : Hsu Chia-chen 's father is a civil servant , and her parents gave her a strict upbringing ; and Hung Hsiao-hui had always been a " good student , " with excellent grades since childhood and a smooth academic career .  
" We men are very lonely inside and need opportunities for growth and exchange , " says resident Chang Chih-pin , a physics instructor at Hung Kuang Institute of Technology . He used to be introverted and taciturn , but after moving here and getting involved in management committee work , he has been molded by his fellow committee members ' soft and maternal ways , and has gradually opened up .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
Two years ago , the special education center at National Taiwan Normal University conducted a survey of Taiwanese firms which made the above bias all too clear . The results indicated that bosses were most willing to hire handicapped persons whose disability involved their arms or legs . The next most " popular " were the hearing impaired , followed by the mentally retarded . Visually-impaired persons did not make a single boss ' list .  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
Most property rights cases in which constitutional interpretations are sought affect individual citizens ' rights , and attract little outside attention or interference . But in other areas social forces ( such as civic groups and the media ) or political forces ( elected representatives ) often get involved .  
In southern Taiwan , although the election for mayor of Kaohsiung also included an independent candidate , Cheng Te-yao , and an NP candidate , Wu Chien-kuo , the real battle remained that between the DPP 's Frank Hsieh and the KMT 's Wu Den-yih . From the very beginning of the campaign it was thought that Hsieh had little chance of winning , having been involved in the Sung Chi-li cult scandal and facing an incumbent with eight years of experience as mayor . At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .  
The satellite project began in June 1994 , when the ROC commissioned the US firm TRW to build ROCSAT-1 . The ROC then selected 28 technicians to go to the US to observe the design and construction . The ROC also requested that TRW transfer the technology necessary to build some of the components . Local firms such as Acer , TranSystems Inc . and Shihlin Electronics then became involved , building the satellite 's onboard computer , its remote interface unit and its solar power panels , respectively .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work .

They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
While she was in the US , it became clear that the United States would soon sever official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China . This event was to have enormous impact upon Taiwanese politics , and Lu was spurred to get involved in politics herself in order to use political power to correct the ills of society . In order to struggle for women 's rights and democracy , she cut her studies short and returned to Taiwan in 1978 to run for the National Assembly .  
I met my husband during high school , when we were both involved in organizing extracurricular activities . After our wedding , we headed off together to the United States for graduate school at Cornell University , but I subsequently learned that I 'm not the right type to work for a PhD . Given the disciplinary division in Western academics , the doctoral scope is too narrow for my broad range of interests .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
The sponsoring organizations make strong efforts to attract excellent instructors . Most of the students are youths with a strong political bent , many of whom hope to become political reporters or legislative assistants , or to find positions at political brain trusts .

Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .

From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency .

When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Helen studied at the Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology but did not graduate , or go on to serve in the medical field .

This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
Danger can be divided into two categories : perceived risk and objective risk . Wu Kuan-chang , exploration aficionado and a student in the doctoral program in Leisure Behavior at Indiana University 's Department of Recreation and Park Administration , points out that people 's anxieties about mountaineering and other adventure activities are primarily subjective perceptions of risk .

The lack of concrete progress in the political process and , which is even more serious , with regard to the cease-fire , the lack of harmonization in the policies and efforts of all the parties involved and the unfortunate continuation of the flow of arms to the country have now made it necessary to make international support conditional on the existence of real , concrete political will among the parties peacefully to resolve their differences and achieve national reconciliation .  
While agreeing with the need for Headquarters to become more involved in validating the aircraft requirements of all missions , the Field Administration and Logistics Division stated that " since this recommendation would involve a major policy initiative , and would consequently entail a comprehensive review , we believe it more judicious to reserve our specific comments in this regard , pending the outcome of a complete evaluation " . 
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
Where politics or interests oppose the development of the legal framework of public administration , regional integration processes , underpinned by economic globalization , may facilitate acceptance of a higher level of legality through the principles involved in the settlement by an international court of matters coming under the treaty .

The report also noted that URNG had committed human rights violations and had failed to observe the commitment to end the suffering of the civilian population by making threats and taking action against civilian property for the purpose of collecting " war tax " ; by unnecessarily endangering civilians not involved in the conflict during attacks on military bases and units ; by laying mines and explosive devices in places where civilians work , live or circulate ; and by taking reprisals . 
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Given the substantial financial implications involved in the current arrangements for additional war-risk insurance , referred to in paragraph 24 ( a ) ( ii ) , alternative arrangements should be sought with the utmost expediency ;  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
In many instances they were headed by or under the patronage of the Head of State or Government , or the first lady of the country ; were established at the senior governmental level ; and often involved several national ministries , with the ministry or authority devoted to family issues , where it existed , usually assuming the lead role .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .

NULLAware of the difficulties often involved in travelling or moving goods within the region , Forum members have agreed that their ministers responsible for transport , including shipping and civil aviation , should meet in order to discuss common problems and to identify areas where enhanced cooperation might provide solutions .  
Today , we recall that almost visionary determination , and we are fortunate to do so in an organization that is vibrant with issues to address and problems to solve , and that is deeply involved in finding solutions to major international crises and increasingly committed to economic development , human rights and social and environmental problems .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
Iraq 's cooperation , including the provision of accurate information and supporting documentation , access to personnel involved in the relevant activities and support of the Commission 's inspection and monitoring efforts will be required , on a continuous basis , in order to enable the Commission to achieve this objective in a speedy and efficient manner .  
While there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was formally sanctioned or approved by military commanders either at the most senior level or locally , it is hard to believe that so many men could have become involved without the knowledge of the local commander .  
But a lot more needs to be learned : the numbers involved world wide , their geographical distribution , their precise needs , how they are being met and by whom , the status of the internally displaced in international law , and the adequacy of the coverage through existing international institutional arrangements for their protection and assistance .  
In the end , the design concept involved the elements of a vertical city in the park ( a tall rectangular slab ) and an integrated civic centre ( composed of the slab , a low General Assembly building and a horizontal link , the Conference building ) .  
Initiatives of the Group have included : the cost-sharing venture to finance a multi-sectoral AIDS study tour for concerned Cambodian government officials in Thailand ; encouragement to the Ministry of Information to take a more active and creative approach in its efforts to inform the Cambodian public ; and improving the coordination between the different United Nations agencies involved in combating the spread of the virus .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Calling on the Secretary-General of the Conference to make appropriate arrangements for convening a regionally representative , independent and prestigious jury to review the best practice submissions and to provide special recognition to the most deserving initiatives promoting sustainable human settlements development in the form of awards to those organizations directly involved in the best practice .  
Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .  
He was well aware of the difficulties involved in proposing strategies to avert situations that would produce refugees , including the varying degree of international and internal consensus and of political commitment by the different parties , conflicting agendas and priorities , absence of media and public interest and donor fatigue .  
The officer 's main responsibilities would include researching the scope and functioning of other " Truth Commissions " in which the United Nations and national bodies have been involved and discuss with relevant experts the substantive and practical experience acquired which may be useful and applicable to the Guatemalan case .  
States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .

economic and trade relations had a negative impact on the development of those countries and , hence , on the situation of women living there ; his delegation therefore believed that the advancement of women involved the implementation of strategies aimed at establishing equitable international political and economic relations and that the developed countries had a special responsibility in that respect .  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
The transition from a centrally planned economy and a centralized public administration with the State directly involved in the production of goods and services , to a fully developed public and private sector is not easy to achieve ; it takes time and is expensive .

While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
Aware that they are primarily responsible for promoting their own development through sound and consistent economic and social policies , the developing countries involved in structural adjustment programmes have made enormous sacrifices , which , unfortunately , have not yet achieved the desired results .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The major issues on which the attention of the Organization is focused today , whether we are talking about the principal themes of the Agenda for Peace , the democratization of United Nations structures and their functioning or improving the Organization 's effectiveness , represent a movement , at present relatively limited , in which the Court should legitimately be concerned and , we think , involved .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
A common understanding of shared objectives by the agencies involved and a willingness to support the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs are crucial to ensuring an effective , timely and coordinated response to emergencies .  
In its earnest desire to advance peace , and in its deep conviction that international support to facilitate the process of negotiations by the parties directly involved would be essential to expediting the peace process , Japan has participated actively in the multilateral talks on the Middle East since they were set in motion in Madrid five years ago .  
We would like to emphasize , however in accordance with statements made by the Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference recently held in Chile that it is our position that the problems of that region must be solved in accordance with the constructive spirit of the agreements concluded between the parties involved , while protecting the legitimate rights of all the inhabitants and guaranteeing access to holy places , in full respect of international law .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;  
Yet experience from countries which have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which promote distribution and investment in human resources through the provision of basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved are fundamental to eradicating poverty .  
The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .

Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .

During the period in question , the 411 complaints admitted fell into the following categories : ( a ) torture ( 6.3 per cent ) , an appalling practice which the administrative measures taken against certain officials involved in such cases have not managed to eradicate completely ; ( b ) cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ( 19.2 per cent ) ; ( c ) excessive use of force ( 3.4 per cent ) ; and ( d ) other threats ( 71.1 per cent ) .  
The conduct now of this review , not only of the minimum backstopping requirements but of how best to fund the support account , is also necessary in the context of harmonizing support account requirements with the new budgetary cycle for peace-keeping operations , which covers a 12-month period from July of one year to June of the next year , starting in 1996 .  NULLThe Secretary-General has conducted and completed a comprehensive " bottom-up " review of backstopping requirements of Headquarters departments and offices involved , in the light of recent and prospective changes in peace-keeping operations .  
This seminar will provide instruction in the development of peace-keeping training methods and programmes to a select group of military and civilian police officers who already have previous United Nations peace-keeping experience and who are presently involved in peace-keeping training at the national level , or will likely become involved in the future .  
The Secretary-General 's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH 's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved .  
The most updated theory of international aviation law states than an aircraft designed for " civilian " air transport belonging to a private airline and operated by a civilian crew may in a particular situation be considered to be " State aircraft " if it performs a military , customs or police function . . .  Other aircraft , besides those involved in military , customs or police services , could also be considered " State aircraft " because the enumeration in the Convention is not preclusive .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As may be seen , the United States authorities were perfectly aware of the existence of a group organized in the territory of the United States , equipped with aircraft and involved in carrying out activities inconsistent with the provision of international air services , which uses those aircraft for patently political purposes , disregarding Cuban sovereignty and also ignoring the regulations of the very State in which those aircraft are registered and where its pilots had obtained licences to operate them .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
To achieve broad-based cooperation against drug trafficking by sea , Governments were invited to encourage commercial carriers and professional groups active in maritime transport to become involved in the fight against illicit drug traffic , on the basis of voluntary cooperation and memoranda of understanding at the national and international levels , as well as through training to increase the awareness of maritime transport personnel with regard to illicit drug trafficking .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .

Bi \ x { 9de8 } n Lian ( Norway ) : In the Council debate last Monday , I had the opportunity to express the deep concern of the Norwegian Government with regard to the critical and fragile state of the peace process in the Middle East , and to urge the parties involved in the use of force in southern Lebanon and northern Israel to stop the spiral of violence .  
Although the political environment since the end of the cold war had favoured international cooperation in the utilization of outer space , the level of cooperation remained unsatisfactory ; there was a reluctance to share space benefits because of the huge outlay involved .  
The Under-Secretary-General went on to explain , on the basis of the Council 's previous practice in such cases , that it was probable that the Office would initially be established for a period of six months and that this initial mandate would subsequently be extended for further periods of a similar duration if the Government so wished and the Council was satisfied that the Office 's achievements justified the expenditure involved .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities , sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly where State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , innovative privatization plans should be devised so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions previously performed ;  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
It stands against the letter and the spirit of the Armistice Agreement , recognized by the international community as the legal binding instrument to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula until it will be replaced - hopefully in the near future - by a peaceful settlement agreed upon by all sides involved .  
The question , which was considered against the background of political and ideological confrontation created by the cold war and its bipolar divisions , generated a certain amount of difficulty because it also involved legal , political and procedural elements which complicated the issue .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and microtopographical data of the Area ;  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .

It is at least arguable that the reason why incorrect and seemingly perverse resource allocation , management or land conversion decisions are made in forestry is not that those involved in the decision-making process are unaware of the correct valuation techniques or incapable of applying them , but rather that vested interests operating in the sector are simply unwilling to consider the alternatives such analysis might put forward .  
To the extent , however , that those signals are wrong ( in that they are not reflecting the real value of the resources involved , and the degree of scarcity that is implicit in their continued supply ) , the users will be inefficient and wasteful from a public and societal point of view .  
The unequivocal support extended by the countries of the Commonwealth with regard to the main issues involved in the settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia and their condemnation of aggressive separatism as a completely impermissible and unacceptable phenomenon for the States making up that regional international organization were of vital importance .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
Even if the actors involved in our region had doubts as to the true intentions of the new Burundian authorities , the negotiations required a minimum period of time devoted to specifying negotiable points , to approving an agenda , to determining practical modalities , to identifying negotiators and to the forming of the delegations of the various groups that are parties to the conflict .  
As part of the plan , which involved the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and several international non-governmental organizations , relief food and essential drugs were provided to vulnerable groups , seeds and tools were distributed to farming families , special feeding centres were set up and vaccination campaigns were conducted .  
Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
Educating people about how to save water , setting high efficiency standards for domestic appliances and charging realistic water rates were the main mechanisms involved , and were mirrored by federal legislation that established water as an economic commodity rather than a free good .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .

Experience in countries that have made advances in reducing poverty indicates that strong and sustained political commitment to policies which pay attention to the distribution of income and to investment in human resources through basic social services , combined with effective service delivery mechanisms and mobilization of all the actors involved , is fundamental to the eradication of poverty .  
The Child Protection Code , promulgated by an Act signed in November 1995 , provides specific follow-up to that general policy , with a view to securing the necessary balance between the imperatives of social prevention and the necessities of legal protection , thereby rendering intervention by the various social , educational and legal parties and structures involved in the protection of children effective .  
It would be wholly unrealistic and even irresponsible to believe that , following the 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of between 500,000 and 1-million persons and involved substantial destruction of Rwanda 's infrastructure as well as ensuing instability and violence arising from continuing insurgency and counter-insurgency operations , anything less than sustained remedial efforts can bring about long-lasting improvement in the human rights situation .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .

A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
They should also be charged with raising funds ; channelling international and regional inputs , information and support to the local and grass-roots levels in their respective countries and coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade ; and reporting to the High Commissioner on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade .

An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The problem of communicating how information should be used involved three challenges : how to measure the uncertainty underlying estimates of economic aggregates , such as gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; how to communicate that degree of uncertainty to users ; and how to communicate the conceptual relevance of alternative statistical measures , such as matching available price measures to administrative and policy uses , to different users .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill-treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as the girl child , children of single-parent families and those born out of wedlock , children in rural areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who , in order to survive , are living and / or working in the streets .

It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
Establish cooperative mechanisms with global , regional and national organizations involved in marine geological and geophysical data collection , in particular , data related to the bathymetry , macro - and micro-topographical data of the Area ;  
Being aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
With respect to working methods , his delegation supported the Special Rapporteur 's recommendation that the Commission should adopt a flexible approach involving both codification of international law ( inasmuch as fundamental human rights were involved ) and its progressive development ( as far as matters of succession of States were concerned ) .  
Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
A prerequisite for the smooth functioning of information exchange during the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly is the designation , by all Parties involved in AIJ , of the relevant governmental authority or ministry authorized to accept , approve or endorse activities implemented jointly and to report on them to the Conference of the Parties through the secretariat ( FCCC / SBSTA / 1996 / 8 , para .  NULL  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,

The financial liability involved in the acceptance of gratis personnel relates to costs for secretarial and administrative backstopping , equipment , supplies , office space , utilities , communications , legal and medical services , as well as costs for official travel , daily subsistence allowance and participation in United Nations training and language programmes .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
For countries like Madagascar , South-South and regional cooperation had become a necessary strategy for promoting national , regional and global development through collective autonomy , which was a basic tool for stimulating growth , technologies and accelerated development .  Madagascar was involved in the Indian Ocean Commission and had participated in the work of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) , which united the countries of eastern and southern Africa .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and international private voluntary agencies ,  
The transfer of the productive and social infrastructure of rural human settlements , as well as their housing , to their current occupants remains a complicated undertaking that requires continued efforts from all involved parties , including the affected communities . 
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Moreover , it wished to point out that the fifth preambular paragraph seriously misquoted the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights ; that , contrary to the statement in operative paragraph 3 , nothing in the international human rights instruments precluded the adoption of sanctions under domestic law ; that paragraph 4 wrongly implied that the right to self-determination included a right to trade and economic relations ; and that paragraph 5 incorrectly involved the Commission on Human Rights in issues of trade and economics .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .  The leaders of one opposition party alleged that the Government was involved , while the press quoted foreign officials who implicated the Presidential Security Unit .

Such prohibitions , whether they involved the principle of non-use of force ( subpara . ( a ) ) , avoiding extreme political or economic coercion ( subpara . ( b ) ) , respect for the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents , premises , archives and documents ( subpara . ( c ) ) or the requirement not to derogate from basic human rights , had been generally well accepted .  
Panama recognizes and respects international humanitarian law and shares the will of States to establish mechanisms designed to promote and strengthen the rights of the child , in this case focusing on children who , voluntarily or not , are involved in acts of war and become the obvious victims or silent witnesses of such events , which have pervasive effects on their physical , social and family lives .  
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
The Centre for Human Rights , as well as relevant specialized agencies and international programmes , will explore possibilities for the development and use of advanced technologies , including telecommunications networks , electronic mail databases and data exchange to facilitate networking among international programmes , national focal points , educators and resource and training centres involved in the Decade .  
This hope and faith fuel the efforts of my Government which , under the difficult circumstances of the transition period , and bearing the onerous burden of the consequences of the civil war , is resolving the complex problems involved in transforming the highly centralized economy that we inherited into a market economy .  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .  
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
We hope in particular that the United Nations-system organizations involved in humanitarian assistance do not lose sight of the legitimate requirements of the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to encourage the States concerned to pursue a national policy in accordance with the purposes and basic principles of the United Nations Charter and various international legal regimes , such as , in particular , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , which all Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole are to promote .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The required data included the entire cross-border activity of firms , including trade in goods and services ; investment , both outbound and inbound ; and an indication of the relationship of the firms involved in such activity , such as affiliated firms operating as part of a global production network versus arms-length transactors .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
Considering the long lead times involved in the implementation of energy efficiency measures and in the effective penetration of renewable energy sources in the global energy supply mix , the current trends in power-market restructuring and liberalization worldwide , and the long lifetime of capital equipment , a reappraisal of energy systems with an emphasis on modern technologies is an urgent priority .  
This was done solely in pursuit of internal and external political objectives : to prove that the international community _ NGOs and intergovernmental organizations , all alike _ is involved in attacking Zaire ; that it supports the Government of Rwanda ; and that Zaire is not responsible for the arms trafficking in the refugee camps of which the Security Council accuses it .  
Against this background , allow me to defend the global approach which offers us the advantage of being more rational because it avoids piecemeal perceptions , wiser because it allows for the establishment of the balances necessary in any negotiations , and finally fairer because it does not marginalize anyone ; quite the contrary , it rejects measures that are not lasting and calculations that are narrow and brings all those involved together in the same creative synergy . 
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 50 / 123 of 20 December 1995 in which the Assembly , inter alia , recognized the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The Committee recommends that special protection measures be adopted and implemented in relation to children living and / or working in the street , children in conflict with the law , in particular those deprived of liberty , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , abused and exploited children and children involved with child labour .  
Concerned about continuing deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the Government of the Sudan of civilian targets in southern Sudan , in clear violation of international humanitarian law , which have added to the suffering of the civilian population and resulted in casualties to civilians , including relief workers involved in Operation Lifeline Sudan and with international private voluntary agencies ,  
The chain reaction provoked by that decision to open an archaeological tunnel passing under the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex should have been an important lesson for all the parties involved on what not to do at this critical point in time when , significantly , not only the future of Al-Quds Al-Sharif , but also the future of the entire Middle East peace process hangs in the balance .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .  
The UNSCOM 168 team undertook preparatory work for the December political level talks which included interviews of personnel involved in the storage , movement and destruction , and in accounting of proscribed missile assets declared to have been secretly destroyed in 1991 .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
While the warring parties have shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it is noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans have taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who are not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
The representative informed the Committee that plans now in place to allow pregnant teenagers to continue their education included working with fathers as appropriate and the provision of functional literacy skills programmes , skills training , parenting classes and family life education , which involved family planning and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) education . 
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
At the national level , there are three major types of private actors involved in capital market operations : security exchanges ( the parallel and the over-the-counter markets ) ; domestic custody , settlement and clearing institutions ; and listed companies and brokers .  
Resources required would specifically maintain a core capability , allowing the Base to fulfil essential functions , handling rapid surges of activity through the provision of temporary additional resources drawn from the budgets of the closing or new missions involved .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
In Mozambique a major part of this initiative has involved a radio drama series in which Mozambican actors act out a lively series of plots conveying messages such as the importance of staying in school , how to deal with sexual harassment , AIDS-awareness , and covering delicate issues such as female genital mutilation , early marriages , and the domestic workload of girls .  
These seminars are intended to strengthen the capacity and improve the performance of all public officials - judicial , administrative military , and law enforcement officers involved in the administration of justice at the prefectural level .  
The Secretary-General added , however , that while the warring parties had shown little interest in a peaceful solution , it was noteworthy that some individuals and groups of Afghans had taken initiatives to mobilize moderate , influential Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan who were not directly involved in the ongoing fighting .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development , and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
The source reported that in late 1993 , the appeal division of the Supreme Court barred further habeas corpus applications and ruled that in light of the special circumstances and the seriousness of the crimes involved , the SPO detainees were to remain incarcerated without any specific time limit , until they were charged .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Recognizing the importance from an analytical and operational point of view of identifying the existing linkages among the social , economic , political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of taking appropriate steps to intensify the analysis of issues involved ,  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
France , which was involved in the creation of the Tribunal from the beginning , France , whose army paid a heavy price in the service of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 70 dead , 700 wounded was deeply shocked by recent statements in the press questioning the conduct of States participating in the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) in the implementation of the Tribunal 's decisions . 
Norway firmly believes that the stabilizing presence of a NATO-led military follow-on force , authorized by a Security Council mandate , will also be required after June 1998 , when the current SFOR mandate expires , in order to consolidate our gains and provide vital support to the civilian agencies involved .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .  
It is worth noting as background to this that , between April 1994 and September 1997 , the special authorities responsible for internal security and order obtained information about more than 30 planned terrorist attacks against Cuba organized and prepared in Miami , in the United States , more than 15 of which involved the use of explosives of the type known as C _ 4 .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
In addition , even though the Government is divesting itself of some of its holdings and encouraging greater private investment in vital services and commodities , there are some areas , particularly those surrounding technology , in which the Government has to remain directly involved and catalytic ; it will continue with its practice of seeking consensus on determining key industries and activities crucial and critical for development . 
The ministerial meeting of the Security Council devoted to Africa , held on the commendable initiative of the United States last 25 September , led to a fruitful exchange of views that showed us a real will on the part of the international community to become more actively , more significantly and more concretely involved in a new type of partnership with Africa in order to contribute to its development .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
It is with that concern in mind that for more than a year the Government of Burundi has been engaged in a peace process based on an extensive consultation of our people through domestic debate and on the peace conferences held abroad , so that all the people of Burundi , without exception , could be involved in inclusive political negotiations open to all parties concerned in the conflict in Burundi . 
Mr . Takht-Ravanchi ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : The World Summit for Social Development was a manifestation of the continuing drive at the global level towards achieving a better common understanding of the various elements involved in the social development of modern societies .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
During the Security Council debate of 14 August 1997 on the conclusion of Operation Alba , many delegations described it as a model , including the following aspects : unity of intent by the group of countries involved ; decisive , prompt action taken by the Security Council ; a very clear mandate ; definite limits on the time-frame ; rapid planning and deployment ; and in-depth political coordination and consultation among all the parties involved , with none excluded , through an ad hoc steering committee .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
These experiments are aimed at laying the practical foundations for enabling human beings to spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of space flight ( studies on radiation safety , strain on the human support and locomotive system , determination of the mechanisms involved in vestibular disorders and changes in the cardiovascular system , and development of methods for their prevention or treatment ) .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
Most representatives agreed with the Commission 's proposed approach to separate consideration of the question of the nationality of natural persons from that of the nationality of legal persons and to give priority to the former , which , it was argued , involved human rights , while the latter raised problems of an economic order .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved .

Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
The sponsors and executive entities of , and the research teams involved in , the above-mentioned surveys agreed that there was a need for more coordination and complementarity in applying the experiences and the results of the surveys , in order to enhance the understanding of crime and criminal justice processes at the international as well as at the national and local levels .  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Disaggregated data and appropriate indicators seem to be lacking to assess the situation of children , especially those who are victims of abuse , ill _ treatment or child labour or are involved with the administration of juvenile justice , as well as refugee and internally displaced children , children of single _ parent families , children in rural and remote areas , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , and children who are living and / or working on the street .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit an in-depth evaluation and subsequent budgetary proposals that reflect as closely as possible the overall evolution of peacekeeping trends , including any relevant restructuring of the various divisions and units involved in backstopping activities , taking into account the lessons learned from previous years ' experience of operating the support account and the workload relating to closed and completed missions ;  
This exercise involved extensive external and internal consultations throughout 1994 and 1995 and culminated in the introduction in January 1996 of a modified organizational structure consisting essentially of redefined divisional responsibilities and the creation of a Corporate Strategy and Quality Assurance Section to facilitate a corporate approach to the delivery of services .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
IASC has agreed that simple field-based monitoring systems should be established in all complex emergency situations in which the United Nations system is involved in order to facilitate accountability , to optimize utilization of resources , to avoid duplication of effort and to adapt to changing circumstances .

When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .

One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
A view widely shared by Governments was that the formulation of effective recommendations for action had to be based on a solid understanding of the various aspects of international migration and development , and on reliable information regarding the multifaceted experience of the countries involved in the international migration process .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
Even though participants in the Conference had included the main representatives of the public , private and community sectors involved in the development of human settlements , the appeal which had been made at the Conference could not bear fruit without assistance and cooperation at the national level and , in particular , without the solidarity and effective and timely delivery of international contributions .

IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
UNDCP held two meetings , in June and October 1997 , with its regional advisers and chief technical advisers involved at the field level in key alternative development projects .

His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
UNDCP has three main sources of expertise : its own internal experts appointed on permanent or fixed-term contracts ; national and international institutions involved in drug-related issues ; and independent consultants .  
In accordance with commonly accepted national and international criteria , these indicators should be relevant , simple and measurable , and due account should be taken of the difficulties involved in measuring the impact of analytical work .

Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
Recognizing that the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level , that Governments , non-governmental organizations and public and private institutions should be involved in the implementation process and that national mechanisms also have an essential role in this regard , and bearing in mind that enhanced national efforts and international cooperation are essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action ,  
In pursuing a comprehensive model of preventive action , UNPREDEP has also been involved in a wide range of programmes related to good governance and the rule of law , strengthening of national capacity and infrastructure , institution - building and human resources development in the governmental and civil sectors .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .

There must be no misunderstanding : here we are dealing with apparently simple principles which require those involved in education to strike out in genuinely new directions , either in order to take a concept of education that is still too narrow and individualistic and open it up to universal values or in order to take an education that is too universalist or ideological and refocus it on the human person .  
In the Belgian language case , for example , the [ European ] Court [ of Human Rights ] , referring to the preparatory work involved in the negotiation of the First Protocol , commented that only religious convictions were intended ; the term ' philosophical ' had been added to the term ' religious ' only in order to cover opinions that were not consistent with religious thinking or teaching , such as agnostic or atheistic convictions .

The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .
