The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
Perhaps , Li Hongzhi and his people think that inciting some addicts into causing troubles can win merits from the foreign boss and allow " Falungong " to linger out a feeble existence .  However , the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square exactly further exposed Li Hongzhi 's scheme .  The horrifying looking burnt addicts , as images of teachers by negative example , tell people that " Falungong " is a cult and tolerance toward the cult means cruelty to the innocent lives .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
As our country was joyously greeting the first lunar New Year holiday of the new century , several " Falungong " fanatics , confused and poisoned by Li Hongzhi 's " going to heaven to reach total completeness " heresy , organized and manufactured a horrifying incident of self-immolation and caused a tragedy of one death and four severely burned individuals .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
" Falungong " stirred up an immolation incident , and has harmed human lives , impaired " Falungong " practitioners ' physical and mental health , assembled people to make troubles , disrupted social order , and undermined national security - - all these are characteristics common to sects .  
As long as one of the parties does not incite excessively strong national sentiments and give those espousing the " China Threat Theory " a handle , while the other party steps back from its presumptuous " cowboy " style , then it is believed that the chance to eventually have this incident smoothly resolved will be greater than the chance of having things deteriorate .  However , before everything is cleared up , all of us have to be psychologically prepared for certain storms in the course of settlement .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
On the other hand , sources from Jiangxi said that Shu Shengyou had actually lost his powers as provincial governor and did not perform any active duty .  The new provincial governor will be announced after the candidate is approved by the provincial people 's congress .  The two people 's dismissal from the top provincial leading positions was related to the explosion incident on 6 March in a primary school , where 42 people were killed .  
Quoting an anonymous Washington official , a foreign news agency reported that after the aircraft collision incident , three missile destroyers that had just completed their vocation in Hong Kong immediately changed their schedule of returning to the base in US West Coast , turned back to the South China Sea , and stayed in the vicinity of Hainan Island to " await orders . "  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
According to the principle of state responsibility stated in international law , the US Government must apologize to the Chinese Government and people , stop immediately all its reconnaissance activities along the coastal areas of China , actively cooperate with the Chinese Government to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of this incident , and compensate in a rapid , complete , and effective manner for the personnel and property losses on the part of the Chinese side .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
Although the two speeches made by President Bush were rather rude andperemptory , comments from foreign mass media also noticed that US Secretary ofDefense Rumsfeld , a " hawkish figure , " did not make any open speech on the eventand was criticized by other hawkish figures in the United States . This mayindicate a possibility that after the occurrence of the incident , the hawkishdecision-makers in the United States were not appointed to play a major role inthe handling of the crisis .  
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
As for the process of handling the incident , Jin Chanrong said , there existed some problems in the foreign policy-making body of the Bush administration .  Although there are some veteran officials with rich experience inside the government , it was hard to find someone who may have a final say and can convince others , or it is possible that the veterans with experience may be short of the ability to handle new problems .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
When our country was conducting military exercises in the East Sea and you , the United States , were engaging in reconnaissance activities , we just ignored you , and you thought that this was very " normal . "  But on this occasion , this incident occurred in an exclusive economic zone of China , or at the doorway of China ; you regarded it as " abnormal " and adopted a tough attitude .  
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today that over the past few days , the Chinese and US sides have held several rounds of diplomatic negotiations with regard to handling the incident in which the US surveillance aircraft collided with and damaged a Chinese fighter , left a Chinese pilot missing , and intruded into China 's airspace and landed at an airport in China without permission .  
The China-US " aircraft collision incident " has entered its eighth day .  While paying close attention to the developments of the situation , Beijing residents continued to condemn the hegemonistic acts of the United States and expressed their worry about Wang Wei , a hero , and their strong national feelings .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The responsibility of the incident completely lies on the US side .  The Chinese Government filed a protest and made solemn representations to the US Government over the US act violating international law , encroaching on China 's airspace and sovereignty , and compromising China 's national security and interests , demanding that the United States undertake full responsibility for the incident , apologize to the Chinese people , and take practical and effective measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .  They expressed the belief that such overbearing words and deeds to get what one wanted were no longer appropriate , increased tensions in the world , and made countries uneasy .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
Zhang Qiyue said : The US plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane , resulting in the missing of a Chinese pilot , intruded into China 's airspace , and landed at a Chinese airfield without permission .  The incident has not fully concluded .  The Chinese side asks the US side to provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people , stop sending its airplanes to conduct reconnaissance activities above the Chinese coast , and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
The citizens of Cincinnati were extremely angry after this incident of acting with total disregard for human life occurred , and protest demonstrations developed into violent citywide racial clashes .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
Chinese law and international issues experts , in interviews with reporters today , made the following comments in succession : The arrogant US attitude of acting recklessly and irresponsibly that was evident in the handling of the aircraft collision incident is an essential reflection of the US Government 's vigorous pursuit of hegemony and power politics .  It could only arouse strong dissatisfaction and distrust in the international community , including among the Chinese people .  It will not help at all in dealing with actual problems .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
At the end of the first round of talks between China and the United States , Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhang Qiyue held a press conference .  Besides introducing the situation of the current talks , he showed video tape recordings on a large screen and photos of the collision incident collected by the Chinese side and simulated course of the plane collision incident prepared by the Chinese side .  
Because when the US plane crew left Hainan Dao and before they arrive in Hawaii , US leaders immediately changed their attitude .  They publicly denied that they had made apologies to the Chinese side for their mistake , attempted to save face for having sent a letter to express sorry for the incident , and tried to create favorable opinions for the subsequent talks between the two sides .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
The top level of the CPC believes , however , that Bush 's remarks represent the hawkish forces in the United States ; since the collision involving the US plane on 1 April , these forces have consistently dominated the new President 's China policy ; the hardline stance of hawkish figures at Bush 's side such as Vice President Cheney , National Security Assistant Rice , and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld in handling the collision incident has been profoundly appreciated by Bush , and so the tough US line on China will be continued .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
At the same time , the Japanese Government headed by Yoshiro Mori also adopted an indulgent attitude towards a history textbook for secondary schools compiled by a right-wing organization .  As the textbook sought to beautify the Japanese war of aggression , the incident triggered wave upon wave of vehement criticisms at home and abroad .  
A senior personality from Taiwan 's military even declared in public : " We monitored the entire process of the incident and recorded the mid-air conversations made by the Chinese communists ' pilots . "  " We have handed over the tape recordings to the US side . "  
Article 15 .  Following the occurrence of an extraordinarily serious safety incident that has a particularly pernicious social impact , or whose nature is particularly serious , the State Council will mete out disciplinary sanctions against the provincial governor , autonomous region chairman , or mayor of the municipality under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction , and the chief responsible persons of the relevant State Council departments .  
As an important individual involved in the 4 June incident , Bao Tong 's " confession , " using his own experience , reveals new , never-heard-of information regarding high-level policymaking related to the 4 June incident .  This will help further reveal the truth of policymaking related to the 4 June incident .  It will also encourage more individuals in the party who took part in the then policymaking to provide more detailed information , so as to lay a solid social foundation for the final reversion of the verdict on the 4 June incident .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
This exercise was held in order to further test and perfect the US-ROK " 5027 " provisional joint combat plan , enhance the joint command and coordinated combat capability of the two armies , and raise the rapid reaction capability of the US-ROK joint forces in dealing with a sudden incident .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
The attempted bloody self-immolation incident plotted by the Dalai clique once again let people clearly see , hidden under the hypocritical face of " guardian of human rights " of the 14th Dalai Lama , its bloody nature of harming human lives , harming society , trampling on human rights , and splitting the motherland .  
The relevant reports quote senior officials in Beijing as saying that US arms sales to Taiwan , the air collision incident , and public expression of the policy of defending Taiwan by force since Bush took office have caused certain people in the new Taiwan authorities to develop unrealistic illusions , holding that the mainland will not dare to settle the Taiwan problem by force and that even if Taiwan is independent , the mainland will not run the risk of starting a war with the United States in order to launch an armed attack on Taiwan .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
It is reported that Wang Jian , Wen Tiejun , Shi Xiaoming , and other scholars at the State Council think tanks and the China Research Society for Economic Restructuring recently analyzed the US Asia-Pacific strategy , as well as the motive behind a series of its provocative acts against China in the wake of the Sino-US aircraft collision incident , against the background of US capital crisis and from the international economic trends .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
The incident greatly shocked the central hierarchy .  A top leader was said to be so angry that he pounded at the table as he rebuked the two public security and court officials for being decadent in the extreme .  He said that they deserved at least a-thousand deaths for selling their country for a mere sum of money .  
The curtain has finally fallen on the tense and unpleasant order of bilateral relations since the China-US aircraft collision incident occurred on 1 April . China-US relations have started to show signs of easing , with reexplorations now being underway to newly advance forward .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
After the incident of trying to " strangle " Guangzhou 's " Nanfang Dushi Bao " in Shenzhen 's newspaper market in May , relevant departments of Shenzhen found it more pressing to seriously deal with " foreign threat . "  Therefore , they decided to use the publication number ( The publication of books , magazines and newspapers needs a publication number approved by relevant authorities on the mainland . ) for " Touzi Daobao " to run a brand-new daily with metropolitan characteristics .  
In regard to the petroleum , coal , fireworks , small arms ammunition enterprises and other companies engaged in production of easily combustible and dangerous products ; in regard to the airport , train station , wharf , fuel reserve , and other large scale commercial markets , as well as theaters and other public sites ; and in regard to aircraft , trains , passenger automobiles , cargo ships , and other critical installations , we must strengthen investigation and supervision , formulating a truly feasible incident response plan .  
At 22:40 the same day , we drove to Hechi City where the regional leading group in charge of investigating incident was located .  We learned from the leading group 's principal leader that 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident .  
At 24:00 , we , through an internal channel , reported to the central leading authorities that , " according to preliminary investigations , 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident . "  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
The spokesman pointed out that the incident of bombing the embassy has seriously violated relevant international conventions and basic norms governing state-to-state relations , seriously violated China 's sovereignty , deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , and seriously damaged Sino-US relations .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
The spokesman pointed out that the incident of bombing the embassy has seriously violated relevant international conventions and basic norms governing state-to-state relations , seriously violated China 's sovereignty , deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , and seriously damaged Sino-US relations .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
The strategic partnership established between China and the United States in the 1980 ' s has long since ceased to exist .  The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
The exceptionally serious explosion incident in a firecracker plant in Jiangmen must be strictly and rapidly investigated and handled , and persons who should be held accountable for the incident for their negligence in management and failure in abiding by the law , carrying out orders and heeding prohibitions and all relevant responsible persons must be called to account and be strictly punished in line with law .  
With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .  
Although the troublemaking fans were small in number , the incident reflected the problems in organization , such as the lack of proper management , due vigilance , complete and painstaking precautions , and the essential management of soccer fans watching matches , and scant attention which was paid to a handful of lawbreakers taking the occasion to make trouble .  
The mainland 's Second Artillery Corps has also developed a whole series of missiles , including various types of missiles for various purposes , short-range and medium-range missiles , as well as intercontinental missiles ; quite a few of which have attained the advanced world standard .  Once an unexpected incident breaks out , the mainland forces will be able to cross the strait and launch a precision strike .  
The Pachang River incident has produced an unprecedented impact on Taiwan 's politics .  The administrative ability of the new government has all the more been called into question , and the political situation on the island is not stable .  Most public opinion thinks this is a very inappropriate time for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to visit abroad .  
Disregarding strong opposition from the Chinese Government and the Chinese Catholic Church , the Vatican today held a ceremony to " canonize " a number of foreign missionaries and their followers as " saints " who committed hideous crimes in China . This is a serious confrontational incident against the 1.2 billion Chinese people .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
Through initial investigations , it is believed that the [ incident of ] illegal immigrants hiding inside the container discovered by Hong Kong authorities this time was arranged by international criminal cliques .  They first went to Guangzhou from Fujian , then they entered Hong Kong in groups with round trip permits .  
According to an informed source , the tragedy of building collapse in Houjie , Dongguan , has aroused great attention of the central authorities .  The fact that relevant departments in Dongguan concealed the true death toll on purpose for several days in a row has drawn the ire of Beijing authorities .  The Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Public Security have dispatched an investigation group to Dongguan to learn about the truth of the incident through non-governmental channels .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
Zhu Rongji , Hu Jintao and other leading comrades have made instructions , demanding that the incident be properly handled , that its cause be immediately ascertained , and that those who should be held accountable be strictly punished . 
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
In response , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao immediately repudiated this in strong terms , pointing out that the US State Department spokesman " juggled black and white and made irresponsible remarks , " and used the " Falungong " incident to interfere in China 's internal affairs .  He said : This is totally unacceptable to the Chinese side , which has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm objection .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
Suona [ a Chinese musical instrument ] player Liu Ying of Shanghai Conservatory of Music said : Being a Chinese musician and a member of the same age group , I am deeply sorry for Chen Guo , a young female musician victimized in the suicidal incident .  Chen Guo was getting mature in her musical performance skills , but she was taken by Li Hongzhi as a tool and sacrifice .  This is indeed a very painful consequence that makes people sad .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
People attending the forum were all filled with righteous indignation at the tragic incident which shocked all people inside and outside China , and pointed out that the incident once again fully exposed the out-and-out evil cult nature of " Falungong . "  
People speaking at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square thoroughly exposed the nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult that causes disasters to the nation and the people and the fact that " Falungong " has become a tool of the international anti-China forces .  The struggle against " Falungong " is a major issue of cardinal principles and is related to social peace and stability and the people 's well-being .  
After the self-immolation incident occurred , the entire nation expressed its extreme anger at the inhumane crimes of the " Falungong " cult , which are disastrous to the nation and its people .  The masses reacted with anger in many ways against the " Falungong " cult , calling for the government to strike out hard against the cult to protect social stability .  
Comrades from the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , the Ministry of Civil Affairs , the Ministry of Construction , the China Meteorological Administration , and other departments said : The party and government 's prompt prevention and rescue measures in this incident were very effective .  The spot coverage of the incident is a good way of reporting , and the detailed reports have effectively exposed the antihuman , anti-society , and anti-science heretical nature of Falungong . The bloody facts have also fully revealed Falungong as a cult slaughtering people and committing heinous crimes .  
They are genuine evil creatures committing monstrous crimes .  Former Falungong practitioner Zhang Kuilin said that the collective self-immolation incident which occurred in Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve is a bloody fact and a heinous crime committed by Li Hongzhi and his Falungong cult against mankind and China .  
This source also said that the Beijing authorities have had evidences showing that the foreign journalists detained on that day had known beforehand that " Falungong " practitioners would engage in fierce activities in Tiananmen Square . After verifying that these journalists really involved themselves in the drawing up of the plot for this incident , the Beijing authorities will not rule out taking legal actions against these journalists on charge of intentional murder because they " had instigated and assisted others to commit suicide . "  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
Those who fell under the spell of " Falungong " created the self-immolation incident in Tiananmen square , and this bloody lesson served to sound the alarm for society as a whole , particularly those practitioners who are still under the " Falungong " spell , with some people who have been under the spell of " Falungong " for a long time being deeply moved and shaken to their very souls , indicating their resolve to make a total break with the " Falungong " cult .  
Some senior central officials even feel that by changing the " 4 June incident " from " upheaval " to " disturbance , " Jiang Zemin 's political attitude toward such a major political incident , whose nature has been determined by the central authorities , is equivocal and will encourage political opposition and the trend of bourgeois liberalization .  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
The circular stated : The explosion incident , which left 69 people dead or injured , has caused extremely grave consequences and an abominable influence in the society .  
Though being a typical criminal case in nature , the incident has laid bare serious problems in school management as well , such as people without fixed duties in the society being allowed to enter a school as they please , the absence of a strong sense of security or prevention in schools , and the failure to enforce forceful protection measures or tight security in schools .  
The notice stated : Since the explosion incident broke out in the school on 6 March , the public security departments have carried out thorough-going investigations ; gathered evidence ; defined the incident as a typical criminal case ;  
Zhu Bangzao pointed out that we have noticed that some media spread news about the incident in an irresponsible manner before it was thoroughly investigated , and some foreign media also spread untrue information about the incident .  They embellished the incident , distorted facts , and attacked China . Such acts have violated the professional ethnic of correspondents and are preposterous and wrong .  
A comprehensive investigation conducted by an independent team concluded that the landslide at Ching Cheung Road was caused by exceptional , high transient groundwater pressures resulting from extreme rainfall at the site in the weeks preceding the incident .  
" Events during the last 15 years have demonstrated how Hong Kong and the dollar link have weathered the storm - the 1987 stock market crash , the 1989 June 4 incident in Beijing , the 1990 Gulf War , the 1995 Mexican peso crisis , and now the Asian financial crunch .  " Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
" The combined effect of all this was that mud , which had accumulated in a section of the underground piping , was washed into the in-service water main of the residential blocks , contaminating the potable water supply , " he explained .  Other possible factors have also been identified to have contributed to the incident , including the change of contractor ( due to liquidation of the original contractor ) where no handover of works and as built records had been made between the contractors .  
Question : It is reported that on April 5 , a bus driver allegedly closed the boarding gate and started the bus without noticing that an elderly man was still boarding the bus .  As a result , the old man got his leg trapped by the boarding gate and was dragged along and injured , and it was found that no sensory device was installed on the boarding gate of the bus involved in the incident .  
One of the three officers injured during the incident has been treated and discharged while the remaining two listed in stable and satisfactory condition respectively in hospital .  
" From major disasters such as the Lan Kwai Fong incident , the Garley Building fire and the recent air crash at Chek Lap Kok , to smaller-scale ones such as wall collapses , localised landslides and flooding , they all require a swift and correctly structured response to enable the saving of life and at the same time enable speedy recovery from inevitable chaos , " Mr Cheung said .  
Of the eight workers injured in the fire incident , five have since been discharged while two are still being treated in hospital .  One of them is still in critical condition and the other is reported to be recovering in satisfactory condition .  
The last two months , in particular , are marked by a series of security events of diverse nature , ranging from the Hei Ling Chau prison riot ; to the Police 's use of pepper foam in handling the scuffle with demonstrators on 26th June ; the subsequent enquiry into the role played by students ; the hostage incident at the Hong Kong International Airport staged by a lone ' gunman ' ; and , of course , the suspected arson attack at Immigration Department on 2nd August .  
Respondents were asked how satisfied they were with the Police service provided via different points of contact .  They formed favourable views on five main areas of Police / public interaction .  In particular , respondents considered their experience with Police at incident scenes and with the 999 emergency telephone service as very positive with 88 per cent and 85 per cent ratings respectively .  
" The incident has also given rise to wide discussion and concerns both within the Force and amongst the community .  Force management fully appreciates the concerns expressed .  Whilst we are fully aware of the importance of internal communications , we are also cognizant of the fact that we are not perfect in all aspects .  All the views expressed will be carefully considered , " Mr Tsang said .  
The spokesman said that in the wake of the recent avian flu incident , the Government has enhanced the surveillance system on avian flu at all levels , including increasing the number of blood test at borders and wholesale markets , to make the surveillance programme extremely sensitive and effective .  " This will enable the Government to take appropriate follow-up actions once viruses are detected by the surveillance system , " he said .  
In the light of the on-going public concern relating to the disciplinary hearings on the incident of YU Man-hon , we are prepared to disclose , on an exceptional basis , in summary the facts that have been brought forward in the disciplinary hearings .  
She has white short hair and was wearing a light blue blouse , black trousers and a pair of brown slippers during the incident .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .  
" The Government has expressed grave concern over this incident .  We consider that such an act has damaged our social and moral values .  This is not acceptable and should be condemned by the society and subject to legal sanction .  
The deceased , with no identity document found on him , aged about 70 , is about 1.6 metres tall , of thin build and has short grey hair and moustache .  He was wearing a grey overcoat , blue shirt , a pair of grey trousers and black leather shoes during the incident .  
Upon receipt of such information , HKCERT will conduct technical analysis and risk assessment , and collate the findings into a clear and simple alert for dissemination to the public .  The alert will include a summary of the incident , relevant preventive and remedial measures , as well as technical recommendations .  The aim is to help the public understand the development and impact of the incident so that effective preventive and remedial actions can be taken .  
" Meanwhile , there is no evidence to suggest that Canadian beef still on sale in the local market is unsafe as the Alberta incident appears to be an isolated case and beef already arrived has been certified by the Canadian authority to be originated from BSE-free cattle and is fit for human consumption , " the spokesman emphasized .  
During the process , members met and discussed with a wide range of stakeholders and players in the incident , including legislators , hospital and public health authorities , Hospital Board members , local experts and academia , frontline health care workers and organisations as well as private practitioners , Amoy Gardens resident representatives , operators of old age homes , patient groups , media representatives and health care workers contracted SARS .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
The little incident described below is a classic anecdote of the Yu family . When their eldest son was born in Washington , D . C . , Mrs . Yu 's mother was unable to come all the way to the United States and help her daughter with the month of recuperation and special diet required by Chinese tradition . Mother-in-law then wrote to son-in-law exhorting him to be sure to stew a chicken for the postpartum mother , to help her regain her strength .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
Not so long ago , R . O . C . business-men were involved in the killing of seals in South Africa , which was followed by the rhino horn incident and the reckless killing of the black-faced spoonbill . These incidents have challenged the humane philosophy Chinese have traditionally held dear .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
In 1993 , another dinosaur incident on the mainland startled people worldwide . When digging , country folk in Hunan 's Xixia County accidentally came across " black stone eggs , " which they then went on to sell as an ingredient for Chinese medicine . It was only after thousands had been dug up and sold that a Nanjing customs inspector discovered that these black " stone eggs " were in fact being viewed as priceless dinosaur eggs elsewhere in the world !  
Although the Chinese communist authorities have already announced that they have arrested three suspects for robbing the passengers and burning the boat , the rigid attitude displayed by mainland China after the incident , their imperious obstruction of bereaved family members and reporters from Taiwan , and their sustained insistence that the incident was simply an accident , generated a strong reaction in Taiwan , where people moved to completely boycott cross-Strait exchanges .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
Lucy 's owner was frantic , not knowing what could be done to save her . Just then , there was an incident of a police dog killing one of the six ravens guarding the Tower of London . The dog was pardoned however , and the precedent spared Lucy the death penalty . This amusing incident happened in England , but was reported by media worldwide , attracting the attention of many animal lovers .  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Lately Taipei has been all abuzz over the " Lu An-ni incident . " Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet . Though Liao later made a strong statement attacking Siew and Control Yuan President Wang Tso-yung was also critical , the incident was settled in a short time due to Premier Siew 's actions .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped . Underground parking-lots became underground reservoirs , and flooded transformer boxes blew out , cutting off electricity and water supplies to many buildings . In one dreadful incident , someone actually drowned while trying to get downstairs by elevator .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic . In a previous incident , most primary and secondary schools in Nara , Japan stopped using melamine tableware after intense protests from parents , even though the manufacturer had established that the plates and bowls would not release BPA if the children did not scratch them with their cutlery .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
In response to questions raised by conservationists both in Taiwan and abroad , COA vice chairman Lee Jen-chyuan stated that this has been a painful experience , and demonstrated that the management of wildlife preserves had to be further improved . Lee also expressed the hope that the incident would encourage the people of Taiwan to give more thought to conservation .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
The incident was sparked when police stopped a pair of students from NTU and Taipei Teachers ' College for riding double on a bicycle . When the students proved uncooperative , the police beat and detained them , setting off a chain of events that eventually led to mass arrests by the military police .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
What 's more , criminal gangs began to control many of the venues , and related incidents were the subject of frequent unflattering press reports . Because of an underworld disagreement , gang leader Yang Shuang-wu shot and injured singer Kao Ling-feng at one such establishment in Kaohsiung . The incident shocked Taiwan , and many started to view these places as dens of iniquity . Attendance fell markedly .  
They soon sent out an expeditionary force to Taiwan , making representations to the Qing court with the excuse that the Chinese had done nothing about the incident . After the Japanese landed the " barbarian " villages surrendered one after the other . The Japanese troops set up camp nearby and planned on a long stay .  
Speaking of sports marketing , retired NBA star Michael Jordan recently ruffled feathers in Taiwan in a whirlwind stopover , ducking out of sight after a quick 90-second appearance before fans who had waited three hours to see him . High-flying Taiwan Nike eventually had to make a public apology for the fiasco . The company had thought to score a marketing coup on the strength of Jordan 's huge appeal , but the incident only proved that fans can put you on a pedestal , and fans can pull you back off it .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
With regard to the ICAO investigation , although it is part of the United Nations manoeuvre to bring the incident before the Security Council , we are not afraid of it ; on the contrary , we accept it and we demand that it should be rapid and impartial , and that it should take into account all the background information and the gross provocations we are suffering from as a result of the repeated violation of our airspace and the risks they entailed to air traffic and to our country . 
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
If the enemies do not return our small submarine , survivors and the dead unconditionally while continuing to make ill use of the incident for the sinister political purpose , we will be forced to take strong countermeasures .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  NULLFinally , UNIFIL continued to make every effort to ensure security and protection of its staff :  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation , were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
In that report I stressed the exemplary conduct of the parties , which allowed the process to conclude without incident and within the agreed time span , as well as the remarkable cooperation of the international community which provided vital logistic support to the demobilization process .  
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
UNIFIL has completed a full review of the damages resulting from the incident that occurred at Qana and the surrounding area on 18 April 1996 and identified the total costs directly attributable to the incident at $ 893,319 , comprising $ 552,474 in damages to the headquarters compound of the Fijian battalion and $ 340,845 in damages sustained in other surrounding positions in the UNIFIL area of operations .  
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
The representative of CSI acknowledged that the incident in question included a number of procedural errors as detailed in the formal written response submitted to the Committee .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,  
Alternative 1 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response [ to natural disasters as well as the need to contain ] [ aimed at containing ] environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;

Under article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus , the murder of a representative of a foreign State with the aim of provoking a war or international incident is punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of 10 to 15 years or by death , and grievous bodily harm inflicted on such a representative with the same aim is punishable by deprivation of liberty for 8 to 15 years .  
In the document PGR explained the Acteal massacre as the culmination of long-standing and unresolved conflicts between local indigenous communities , and concluded that the authorities had contributed to the increasing tensions and insecurity by failing to take appropriate action to investigate a series of crimes committed in the region before the incident on 22 December 1997 .  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Her Government had never received any complaint on the subject from any religious institution , whether in Angola or abroad , and no substantive evidence had been submitted as to the identity of the victims , the area in which the incident was alleged to have occurred , or the name of the congregation concerned .  
However , there are problems of protecting the individual in the event of biomedical experimentation , especially to ensure respect for the integrity of persons participating in such research and their free and informed consent based on an assessment of the risks involved , in order to avoid any untoward incident or undesirable effect .  
Examinations of detainees by medical doctors selected by them should be given weight in any court proceedings ( relating to the detainees or to officials accused of torture or ill-treatment ) equivalent to that accorded to officially employed or selected doctors having comparable qualifications ; the police bringing a detainee to a medical examination should never be those involved in the arrest or questioning of the detainees or the investigation of the incident provoking the detention .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
It is proposed to strengthen the Training Unit by two Professional ( 1 P-3 and 1-P-2 ) and one Security Service post to provide more comprehensive central training for security officers seconded or appointed to new and / or expanded peacekeeping operations on firearms qualification and certification , incident command system , dignitary protection , advanced security skills , United Nations use-of-force policy , emergency operations , investigations , fire and safety regulations , defensive tactics and advance first-aid provision . 
The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
She is not an isolated individual .  She is the candidate chosen by the DPP and a political figure who is about to step up to the front stage in Taiwan . Hence , the remarks on splitting the motherland which she has spread through the media , are yet another political incident , following Lee Teng-hui 's two-state theory , that has seriously provoked China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
Perhaps , Li Hongzhi and his people think that inciting some addicts into causing troubles can win merits from the foreign boss and allow " Falungong " to linger out a feeble existence .  However , the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square exactly further exposed Li Hongzhi 's scheme .  The horrifying looking burnt addicts , as images of teachers by negative example , tell people that " Falungong " is a cult and tolerance toward the cult means cruelty to the innocent lives .  
The self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square is not merely Li Hongzhi 's stinging slap in the face to his disciples , but it should be said that the political intelligence of the anti-China forces in the West has sunk to so low a point that they are unable to tell black from white , and they willfully confuse right with wrong . 
As our country was joyously greeting the first lunar New Year holiday of the new century , several " Falungong " fanatics , confused and poisoned by Li Hongzhi 's " going to heaven to reach total completeness " heresy , organized and manufactured a horrifying incident of self-immolation and caused a tragedy of one death and four severely burned individuals .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
The obsessive " Falungong " followers who set themselves ablaze at Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve perpetrated a self-immolation incident that shook the whole world because they had long been poisoned by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi . They had lost their sense of reasoning as normal human beings when they turned their backs on their loved ones , their family , their school and the normal society .  
" Falungong " stirred up an immolation incident , and has harmed human lives , impaired " Falungong " practitioners ' physical and mental health , assembled people to make troubles , disrupted social order , and undermined national security - - all these are characteristics common to sects .  
As long as one of the parties does not incite excessively strong national sentiments and give those espousing the " China Threat Theory " a handle , while the other party steps back from its presumptuous " cowboy " style , then it is believed that the chance to eventually have this incident smoothly resolved will be greater than the chance of having things deteriorate .  However , before everything is cleared up , all of us have to be psychologically prepared for certain storms in the course of settlement .  
This former government official , who is unwilling to disclose his name , believes that because their military aircraft crashed in the incident , the Chinese communists will certainly take advantage of this incident to force the United States to apologize , despite the fact that the US Armed Forces Pacific Command announced that the EP-3 plane was performing its mission over the international open sea and did not intrude the Chinese communists ' territorial airspace .  
On the other hand , sources from Jiangxi said that Shu Shengyou had actually lost his powers as provincial governor and did not perform any active duty .  The new provincial governor will be announced after the candidate is approved by the provincial people 's congress .  The two people 's dismissal from the top provincial leading positions was related to the explosion incident on 6 March in a primary school , where 42 people were killed .  
Quoting an anonymous Washington official , a foreign news agency reported that after the aircraft collision incident , three missile destroyers that had just completed their vocation in Hong Kong immediately changed their schedule of returning to the base in US West Coast , turned back to the South China Sea , and stayed in the vicinity of Hainan Island to " await orders . "  
" Hong Kong Shang Pao " pointed out in its editorial : The pernicious incident of US military reconnaissance plane colliding with and crashing our military plane has caused an extremely great concern in the international community and particularly in Asia , and it has also aroused a strong indignation among the Chinese people .  
In answering questions from reporters at a press conference today , Zhu Bangzao stressed that the US aircraft that caused the incident was no ordinary plane , but was a military reconnaissance aircraft which , after crashing into the Chinese military aircraft , illegally entered Chinese airspace without the consent of the Chinese and landed at a Chinese airfield .  
After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Fu Dunchun , associate professor of Hainan University , said : a US military reconnaissance plane gathered intelligence in air space over the South China Sea , bumped and damaged our military aircraft , and illegally landed on our territory .  The US side has felt no regret at all , made false countercharges and claimed that " China should be held responsible for the incident . "  The United States has totally exposed its hegemonism .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
According to the principle of state responsibility stated in international law , the US Government must apologize to the Chinese Government and people , stop immediately all its reconnaissance activities along the coastal areas of China , actively cooperate with the Chinese Government to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of this incident , and compensate in a rapid , complete , and effective manner for the personnel and property losses on the part of the Chinese side .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
Military sources in Beijing have revealed that the military exercise under way in the South China Sea has been affected by the collision incident and been forced to make a major readjustment ; a number of scheduled maneuvers have been cancelled and the focus has switched to dealing with the aftermath , including the order to the exercise units to repeatedly search for the missing pilot and recover the plane .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
The editorial says : The current incident of bumping aircraft was caused by the US side single-handedly based on human testimony and material evidence .  However , the US side made unfounded countercharges after the incident , unreasonably criticized the Chinese side , and even used international law to evade its responsibility .  
After the collision incident , the US surveillance plane intruded China 's airspace and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , and this was a move that further violated the regulations set forth by international and Chinese law , thus constituting a gross encroachment upon China 's sovereignty and territorial airspace .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .  They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
In the last incident , the United States used warships to follow the tracks of the " Yinhe " freighter , sent aircraft to circle over it , and created all kinds of difficulties for thefreighter .  In the current incident , the United States is rude and unreasonableand has put forth unreasonable demands , such as not allowing to conducton-board inspection of the plane and returning the plane at once , after itsplane violated China 's territorial airspace and territory .  
It has been learned that , in his recent statement issued to the press inWashington , US Secretary of State Colin Powell for the first time expressed hisregret over an incident in which a US military reconnaissance airplane collidedand damaged a Chinese fighter plane , resulting in a missing pilot whose destinyis still unknown .  
Although the two speeches made by President Bush were rather rude andperemptory , comments from foreign mass media also noticed that US Secretary ofDefense Rumsfeld , a " hawkish figure , " did not make any open speech on the eventand was criticized by other hawkish figures in the United States . This mayindicate a possibility that after the occurrence of the incident , the hawkishdecision-makers in the United States were not appointed to play a major role inthe handling of the crisis .  
The entire officers and men of Hainan 's publicsecurity and border defense units , who are shouldered with the security task ofguarding the 1,700-km coastline and 2.1-million square km of ocean , are filledwith righteous indignation at the incident in which a US militaryreconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane inmidair over the South China sea and entered China 's airspace withoutauthorization .  One after another , they indignantly condemned the US hegemonicacts .  
Reporters Li Kun and Wang Weiping report : Ma Man Kay , president of theMacao China Chamber of Commerce , pointed out that the incident in which the USmilitary reconnaissance plane ramming and damaging China 's military aircraft inairspace above China 's exclusive economic zone and entering China 's territorialairspace and landing at a Chinese airport without permission is a serious onethat has violated international law and violated China 's sovereignty andterritorial airspace .  
If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
The plane collision incident was the first trial of strength in the diplomatic field with the Chinese Communists after Bush took power , but so far , various signs showed that Bush was still short of savvy and proficiency in playing such diplomatic games , and his policy toward Beijing remained unstable .  This gave Beijing an opportunity of criticizing the United States ' usual reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea , and the US side was left with a justifiable argument .  
As for the process of handling the incident , Jin Chanrong said , there existed some problems in the foreign policy-making body of the Bush administration .  Although there are some veteran officials with rich experience inside the government , it was hard to find someone who may have a final say and can convince others , or it is possible that the veterans with experience may be short of the ability to handle new problems .  
Jin Chanrong said : Currently , the political and diplomatic channels remain the main channels for solving the plane collision incident .  The denunciations made by the Chinese Communist side against the US side 's violation of international law and the mainland 's domestic laws were mainly aimed at supporting its own position , not aimed at taking any legal action .  
When our country was conducting military exercises in the East Sea and you , the United States , were engaging in reconnaissance activities , we just ignored you , and you thought that this was very " normal . "  But on this occasion , this incident occurred in an exclusive economic zone of China , or at the doorway of China ; you regarded it as " abnormal " and adopted a tough attitude .  
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today that over the past few days , the Chinese and US sides have held several rounds of diplomatic negotiations with regard to handling the incident in which the US surveillance aircraft collided with and damaged a Chinese fighter , left a Chinese pilot missing , and intruded into China 's airspace and landed at an airport in China without permission .  
The China-US " aircraft collision incident " has entered its eighth day .  While paying close attention to the developments of the situation , Beijing residents continued to condemn the hegemonistic acts of the United States and expressed their worry about Wang Wei , a hero , and their strong national feelings .  
Sino-US diplomatic contacts are now in their 10th day regarding the incident in which a US spy plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter and arbitrarily landed at a Chinese airfield , but the problem can hardly be resolved because the United States , sticking to its high-handed stance , is unwilling to bear the responsibility , and is unwilling to apologize to China .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
Chen Ci held that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
Tang Jiaxuan emphasized that ever since the US reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese military plane , the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China .  
The responsibility of the incident completely lies on the US side .  The Chinese Government filed a protest and made solemn representations to the US Government over the US act violating international law , encroaching on China 's airspace and sovereignty , and compromising China 's national security and interests , demanding that the United States undertake full responsibility for the incident , apologize to the Chinese people , and take practical and effective measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents .  
It was a serious incident that the United States sent a military surveillance plane to conduct spying activities over the exclusive economic zone of China 's Hainan , bumped into and destroyed a Chinese military plane , leaving the Chinese pilot missing , and then entered China 's territorial airspace and landed at Chinese airport .  
US allies generally connected this incident with the United States ' diplomatic tradition and the new Bush administration 's foreign policy .  They expressed the belief that such overbearing words and deeds to get what one wanted were no longer appropriate , increased tensions in the world , and made countries uneasy .  
The incident where the US surveillance plane repeatedly infringed on our coastal waters , and rammed and destroyed the Chinese military aircraft , made the Chinese people further understand that hegemonism truly exist in the world , and aroused their fighting will to make China strong and their determination to seize the opportunity to accelerate economic development .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
Zhang Qiyue said : The US plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese plane , resulting in the missing of a Chinese pilot , intruded into China 's airspace , and landed at a Chinese airfield without permission .  The incident has not fully concluded .  The Chinese side asks the US side to provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people , stop sending its airplanes to conduct reconnaissance activities above the Chinese coast , and take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
The plane collision incident provided an opportunity for the military and the hardliners inside the regime to affect the transfer of power with the impact of the people 's nationalist sentiments .  Jiang did not want to see that the incident developed to a degree that might seriously harm the Chinese Communists ' diplomatic relations with the United States , but neither could he openly show a sign of weakness and be outdone by the US side , because this would affect the legitimacy of his power status at home .  
When the news reached Huzhou that the US Government had offered an apology to the Chinese people for the incident in which a US military surveillance plane caused the crash of a Chinese military aircraft , the parents of missing Chinese pilot Wang Wei felt relieved ; meanwhile , they voiced their resolute support for the way the Chinese Government had handled the incident as well as the stand clearly stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan when he accepted the US apology-giving letter .  
Xu Xinghu 's and Wang Wei 's families agreed that our government has upheld state sovereignty and national dignity in its handling of the plane collision incident , expressed firm support for our government 's correct decision , and demanded that the United States accept all responsibility for the incident and come clean with the Chinese people .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
In order to legalize this rude and unreasonable demand , the US side even made up the absurd argument that the US military plane causing the incident was a part of its territory and US state property and therefore , was eligible for sovereign immunity .  
As mentioned above , the US military reconnaissance plane abused free overflight in airspace over China 's coastal waters , violated flying rules , bumped against and destroyed a Chinese plane , and entered China 's territorial airspace and landed on China 's military airfield without authorization .  That already constituted an incident of serious violation of international law .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
The former official said the debriefings of the 24 crew members after their return to the United States conform to the information disclosed by the US military when the incident first broke out .  Both indicated that the US aircraft was on autopilot , and a fighter of Communist China made a quick forging ahead and pulled up from beneath the US plane , which led to the collision .  
The citizens of Cincinnati were extremely angry after this incident of acting with total disregard for human life occurred , and protest demonstrations developed into violent citywide racial clashes .  
In fact , this incident in which a white policeman shot and killed a black is just the tip of the iceberg in America 's long-running racial problem , and the racial violence that it triggered was by no means accidental ; nor was it an isolated incident , but the evil result of racial discrimination in America .  
Chinese law and international issues experts , in interviews with reporters today , made the following comments in succession : The arrogant US attitude of acting recklessly and irresponsibly that was evident in the handling of the aircraft collision incident is an essential reflection of the US Government 's vigorous pursuit of hegemony and power politics .  It could only arouse strong dissatisfaction and distrust in the international community , including among the Chinese people .  It will not help at all in dealing with actual problems .  
People have noticed that after this incident occurred , political leaders in the United States showed a truculent and unreasonable attitude .  They were forced to express their regret to the Chinese side only after facing tremendous domestic and international pressure .  
At the end of the first round of talks between China and the United States , Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhang Qiyue held a press conference .  Besides introducing the situation of the current talks , he showed video tape recordings on a large screen and photos of the collision incident collected by the Chinese side and simulated course of the plane collision incident prepared by the Chinese side .  
Because when the US plane crew left Hainan Dao and before they arrive in Hawaii , US leaders immediately changed their attitude .  They publicly denied that they had made apologies to the Chinese side for their mistake , attempted to save face for having sent a letter to express sorry for the incident , and tried to create favorable opinions for the subsequent talks between the two sides .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
The top level of the CPC believes , however , that Bush 's remarks represent the hawkish forces in the United States ; since the collision involving the US plane on 1 April , these forces have consistently dominated the new President 's China policy ; the hardline stance of hawkish figures at Bush 's side such as Vice President Cheney , National Security Assistant Rice , and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld in handling the collision incident has been profoundly appreciated by Bush , and so the tough US line on China will be continued .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
At the same time , the Japanese Government headed by Yoshiro Mori also adopted an indulgent attitude towards a history textbook for secondary schools compiled by a right-wing organization .  As the textbook sought to beautify the Japanese war of aggression , the incident triggered wave upon wave of vehement criticisms at home and abroad .  
A senior personality from Taiwan 's military even declared in public : " We monitored the entire process of the incident and recorded the mid-air conversations made by the Chinese communists ' pilots . "  " We have handed over the tape recordings to the US side . "  
Article 15 .  Following the occurrence of an extraordinarily serious safety incident that has a particularly pernicious social impact , or whose nature is particularly serious , the State Council will mete out disciplinary sanctions against the provincial governor , autonomous region chairman , or mayor of the municipality under the Central Government 's direct jurisdiction , and the chief responsible persons of the relevant State Council departments .  
As an important individual involved in the 4 June incident , Bao Tong 's " confession , " using his own experience , reveals new , never-heard-of information regarding high-level policymaking related to the 4 June incident .  This will help further reveal the truth of policymaking related to the 4 June incident .  It will also encourage more individuals in the party who took part in the then policymaking to provide more detailed information , so as to lay a solid social foundation for the final reversion of the verdict on the 4 June incident .  
While China and the United States were entangled in a diplomatic stalemate due to the plane collision incident , a play was put on the stage in Washington : Jasuwant Singh , Indian minister of external affairs and concurrently defense minister , was visiting the United States at the invitation of US Secretary of State Colin Powell . The Pentagon also held a grand welcoming ceremony for him , including the reviewing of honor guards .  
This exercise was held in order to further test and perfect the US-ROK " 5027 " provisional joint combat plan , enhance the joint command and coordinated combat capability of the two armies , and raise the rapid reaction capability of the US-ROK joint forces in dealing with a sudden incident .  
The incident which occurred on 1 April in which a US military reconnaissance plane collided with and destroyed a Chinese fighter plane and then landed on Chinese territory - - the Lingshui Airport on Hainan Island - - had its first phase settled after US President Bush expressed " deep regret " and US Ambassador Preuher delivered a " letter of apology " to the Chinese foreign minister , and then the Chinese government allowed the American crew members to leave for home before Easter because of humanitarian considerations after completing some necessary procedures .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
The attempted bloody self-immolation incident plotted by the Dalai clique once again let people clearly see , hidden under the hypocritical face of " guardian of human rights " of the 14th Dalai Lama , its bloody nature of harming human lives , harming society , trampling on human rights , and splitting the motherland .  
The relevant reports quote senior officials in Beijing as saying that US arms sales to Taiwan , the air collision incident , and public expression of the policy of defending Taiwan by force since Bush took office have caused certain people in the new Taiwan authorities to develop unrealistic illusions , holding that the mainland will not dare to settle the Taiwan problem by force and that even if Taiwan is independent , the mainland will not run the risk of starting a war with the United States in order to launch an armed attack on Taiwan .  
During his inauguration anniversary interview with the Wall Street Journal , he specifically cited the bitter experiences of leaders in neighboring countries in comparison with his own .  Philippine President Estrada was forced to resign , while the Indonesian President was censured by the national assembly , which also threatens to impeach him .  " Taiwan went through the so-called recall incident but made it through in one piece " and the key was that the military did not have a hand in the political scene as Taiwan kept its fine tradition of military nationalization .  
It is reported that Wang Jian , Wen Tiejun , Shi Xiaoming , and other scholars at the State Council think tanks and the China Research Society for Economic Restructuring recently analyzed the US Asia-Pacific strategy , as well as the motive behind a series of its provocative acts against China in the wake of the Sino-US aircraft collision incident , against the background of US capital crisis and from the international economic trends .  
The statement read : " This newspaper will learn a profound lesson from this incident and take effective measures to adopt correct guiding principles for newspaper management , thoroughly implement the principle of ' newspaper management based on political considerations , ' and improve newspaper management by adhering to the policy of fostering unity and stability , serving as an inspirational force , and stressing positive propaganda and by correctly shaping public opinion .  We will do our best to give wide publicity to reform , opening up , and socialist modernization . "  
In the organizational system of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the position of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Yang Jiechi is higher than Zhou Wenzhong . However , Zhou Wenzhong 's current visit to the United States is in the capacity of a special envoy of the Chinese Government and also at a time when the final solution of the plane collision incident has been reached between the two countries .  Therefore , diplomatic circles here have paid high attention to Zhou Wenzhong 's visit to the United States .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
The incident greatly shocked the central hierarchy .  A top leader was said to be so angry that he pounded at the table as he rebuked the two public security and court officials for being decadent in the extreme .  He said that they deserved at least a-thousand deaths for selling their country for a mere sum of money .  
The curtain has finally fallen on the tense and unpleasant order of bilateral relations since the China-US aircraft collision incident occurred on 1 April . China-US relations have started to show signs of easing , with reexplorations now being underway to newly advance forward .  
As disclosed by an informed source , US Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting Beijing around 20 July to repair the battered bilateral relations after the military plane collision incident and the US arms sales to Taiwan and to pave the way for President Bush 's official visit to China this October . He will establish with the Chinese side the general direction and main agenda of the summit meeting , and the Chinese side will recommend to the US side Bush 's specific itinerary at the request of the United States . 
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
This horrifying incident and brutal tragedy has once again thoroughly unmasked the ugly face of Li Hongzhi and his so called " the true , the good , and the tolerant , " and has further laid bare to the world the ugly and inhumane nature of the " Falungong " as an evil cult that harms life .  
After the incident of trying to " strangle " Guangzhou 's " Nanfang Dushi Bao " in Shenzhen 's newspaper market in May , relevant departments of Shenzhen found it more pressing to seriously deal with " foreign threat . "  Therefore , they decided to use the publication number ( The publication of books , magazines and newspapers needs a publication number approved by relevant authorities on the mainland . ) for " Touzi Daobao " to run a brand-new daily with metropolitan characteristics .  
In regard to the petroleum , coal , fireworks , small arms ammunition enterprises and other companies engaged in production of easily combustible and dangerous products ; in regard to the airport , train station , wharf , fuel reserve , and other large scale commercial markets , as well as theaters and other public sites ; and in regard to aircraft , trains , passenger automobiles , cargo ships , and other critical installations , we must strengthen investigation and supervision , formulating a truly feasible incident response plan .  
At 22:40 the same day , we drove to Hechi City where the regional leading group in charge of investigating incident was located .  We learned from the leading group 's principal leader that 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident .  
At 24:00 , we , through an internal channel , reported to the central leading authorities that , " according to preliminary investigations , 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident . "  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .  
After the plane collision incident in early April this year , the Chinese Government actively resolved the incident in reasonable and moderate fashion , but after the US aircrewhad returned home the US side turned around and would not admit that it was in the wrong , and the US military announced the temporary suspension of military exchanges with China .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
The spokesman pointed out that the incident of bombing the embassy has seriously violated relevant international conventions and basic norms governing state-to-state relations , seriously violated China 's sovereignty , deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , and seriously damaged Sino-US relations .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .

When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
The strategic partnership established between China and the United States in the 1980 ' s has long since ceased to exist .  The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .  
The incident in which the dead bodies of Chinese stowaways were discovered at Dover , Britain , several days ago has shocked the international community .  In the view of the official , the incident shows it is highly necessary to step up international cooperation in cracking down on the human smuggling crimes instigated by snakeheads .  
The exceptionally serious explosion incident in a firecracker plant in Jiangmen must be strictly and rapidly investigated and handled , and persons who should be held accountable for the incident for their negligence in management and failure in abiding by the law , carrying out orders and heeding prohibitions and all relevant responsible persons must be called to account and be strictly punished in line with law .  
With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .  
Although the troublemaking fans were small in number , the incident reflected the problems in organization , such as the lack of proper management , due vigilance , complete and painstaking precautions , and the essential management of soccer fans watching matches , and scant attention which was paid to a handful of lawbreakers taking the occasion to make trouble .  
The mainland 's Second Artillery Corps has also developed a whole series of missiles , including various types of missiles for various purposes , short-range and medium-range missiles , as well as intercontinental missiles ; quite a few of which have attained the advanced world standard .  Once an unexpected incident breaks out , the mainland forces will be able to cross the strait and launch a precision strike .  
The Pachang River incident has produced an unprecedented impact on Taiwan 's politics .  The administrative ability of the new government has all the more been called into question , and the political situation on the island is not stable .  Most public opinion thinks this is a very inappropriate time for the leader of the Taiwan authorities to visit abroad .  
Disregarding strong opposition from the Chinese Government and the Chinese Catholic Church , the Vatican today held a ceremony to " canonize " a number of foreign missionaries and their followers as " saints " who committed hideous crimes in China . This is a serious confrontational incident against the 1.2 billion Chinese people .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
Through initial investigations , it is believed that the [ incident of ] illegal immigrants hiding inside the container discovered by Hong Kong authorities this time was arranged by international criminal cliques .  They first went to Guangzhou from Fujian , then they entered Hong Kong in groups with round trip permits .  
According to an informed source , the tragedy of building collapse in Houjie , Dongguan , has aroused great attention of the central authorities .  The fact that relevant departments in Dongguan concealed the true death toll on purpose for several days in a row has drawn the ire of Beijing authorities .  The Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Public Security have dispatched an investigation group to Dongguan to learn about the truth of the incident through non-governmental channels .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
Zhu Rongji , Hu Jintao and other leading comrades have made instructions , demanding that the incident be properly handled , that its cause be immediately ascertained , and that those who should be held accountable be strictly punished . 
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .  
The incident of people trying to burn themselves to death not only undermined the peaceful and harmonious atmosphere of the festive occasion , but also made people suddenly realize that the scourge of " Falungong " cult is no longer gesticulations with hands and feet and the muttering of incantations , but has developed into a frenzied stage of destroying oneself and others and of affecting public order and challenging the rule of law with the extreme behavior of " sacrificing one 's life for a religious cause . "  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
In response , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao immediately repudiated this in strong terms , pointing out that the US State Department spokesman " juggled black and white and made irresponsible remarks , " and used the " Falungong " incident to interfere in China 's internal affairs .  He said : This is totally unacceptable to the Chinese side , which has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm objection .  
They were shocked by and indignant at such an organized and planned scheme , claiming that this incident once again unmasked " Falungong 's " antihuman and antisocial essence of cruelly injuring or killing the people and trampling on human rights .  
I 've come to see more clearly the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult .  The fact that this horrifying incident took place in such a special place and at such a special time has fully shown that the incident , in which several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized and premeditated activity .  
Gu Xiulian , vice president of All-China Women 's Federation [ ACWF ] and first secretary of the ACWF Secretariat , stated : The latest incident , which took place on the Tiananmen Square when several people attempted to burn themselves to death , was an organized , premeditated , and plotted activity , which has made clearer the true nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult , which opposes mankind , society , and science .  
In the incident , several people obsessed with " Falungong , " who were under the spiritual control of Li Hongzhi , attempted to burn themselves to death , turning a blind eye to both love in the world and love in their families and displaying not the least virtue or intuitive knowledge as human beings , and have thus destroyed themselves , their families , and their children as well .  
Suona [ a Chinese musical instrument ] player Liu Ying of Shanghai Conservatory of Music said : Being a Chinese musician and a member of the same age group , I am deeply sorry for Chen Guo , a young female musician victimized in the suicidal incident .  Chen Guo was getting mature in her musical performance skills , but she was taken by Li Hongzhi as a tool and sacrifice .  This is indeed a very painful consequence that makes people sad .  
The self-immolation incident created by several obsessed " Falungong " practitioners on the eve of the Chinese New Year at Tiananmen Square shocked people in all circles and aroused righteous resentment .  People in the overseas Chinese affairs circles today held a meeting to strongly condemn the " Falungong " evil cult 's crime of inhumanely trampling upon human lives .  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
People attending the forum were all filled with righteous indignation at the tragic incident which shocked all people inside and outside China , and pointed out that the incident once again fully exposed the out-and-out evil cult nature of " Falungong . "  
People speaking at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square thoroughly exposed the nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult that causes disasters to the nation and the people and the fact that " Falungong " has become a tool of the international anti-China forces .  The struggle against " Falungong " is a major issue of cardinal principles and is related to social peace and stability and the people 's well-being .  
After the self-immolation incident occurred , the entire nation expressed its extreme anger at the inhumane crimes of the " Falungong " cult , which are disastrous to the nation and its people .  The masses reacted with anger in many ways against the " Falungong " cult , calling for the government to strike out hard against the cult to protect social stability .  
Comrades from the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , the Ministry of Civil Affairs , the Ministry of Construction , the China Meteorological Administration , and other departments said : The party and government 's prompt prevention and rescue measures in this incident were very effective .  The spot coverage of the incident is a good way of reporting , and the detailed reports have effectively exposed the antihuman , anti-society , and anti-science heretical nature of Falungong . The bloody facts have also fully revealed Falungong as a cult slaughtering people and committing heinous crimes .  
They are genuine evil creatures committing monstrous crimes .  Former Falungong practitioner Zhang Kuilin said that the collective self-immolation incident which occurred in Tiananmen Square on Chinese New Year 's eve is a bloody fact and a heinous crime committed by Li Hongzhi and his Falungong cult against mankind and China .  
This source also said that the Beijing authorities have had evidences showing that the foreign journalists detained on that day had known beforehand that " Falungong " practitioners would engage in fierce activities in Tiananmen Square . After verifying that these journalists really involved themselves in the drawing up of the plot for this incident , the Beijing authorities will not rule out taking legal actions against these journalists on charge of intentional murder because they " had instigated and assisted others to commit suicide . "  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
As a matter of fact , this time it was even more unjustified for Yoshiro Mori to use the same excuse as Putin did , because what the boat capsize incident involved are not limited simply to technical problems such as searching for the survivors , but also political and diplomatic issues of crucial importance to Japan such as relations between Japan and the United States . As the Prime Minister , how could he use the excuse " not right to intervene " ?  
Those who fell under the spell of " Falungong " created the self-immolation incident in Tiananmen square , and this bloody lesson served to sound the alarm for society as a whole , particularly those practitioners who are still under the " Falungong " spell , with some people who have been under the spell of " Falungong " for a long time being deeply moved and shaken to their very souls , indicating their resolve to make a total break with the " Falungong " cult .  
Some senior central officials even feel that by changing the " 4 June incident " from " upheaval " to " disturbance , " Jiang Zemin 's political attitude toward such a major political incident , whose nature has been determined by the central authorities , is equivocal and will encourage political opposition and the trend of bourgeois liberalization .  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
The circular stated : The explosion incident , which left 69 people dead or injured , has caused extremely grave consequences and an abominable influence in the society .  
Though being a typical criminal case in nature , the incident has laid bare serious problems in school management as well , such as people without fixed duties in the society being allowed to enter a school as they please , the absence of a strong sense of security or prevention in schools , and the failure to enforce forceful protection measures or tight security in schools .  
The notice stated : Since the explosion incident broke out in the school on 6 March , the public security departments have carried out thorough-going investigations ; gathered evidence ; defined the incident as a typical criminal case ;  
Zhu Bangzao pointed out that we have noticed that some media spread news about the incident in an irresponsible manner before it was thoroughly investigated , and some foreign media also spread untrue information about the incident .  They embellished the incident , distorted facts , and attacked China . Such acts have violated the professional ethnic of correspondents and are preposterous and wrong .  
A comprehensive investigation conducted by an independent team concluded that the landslide at Ching Cheung Road was caused by exceptional , high transient groundwater pressures resulting from extreme rainfall at the site in the weeks preceding the incident .  
" Events during the last 15 years have demonstrated how Hong Kong and the dollar link have weathered the storm - the 1987 stock market crash , the 1989 June 4 incident in Beijing , the 1990 Gulf War , the 1995 Mexican peso crisis , and now the Asian financial crunch .  " Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
" The combined effect of all this was that mud , which had accumulated in a section of the underground piping , was washed into the in-service water main of the residential blocks , contaminating the potable water supply , " he explained .  Other possible factors have also been identified to have contributed to the incident , including the change of contractor ( due to liquidation of the original contractor ) where no handover of works and as built records had been made between the contractors .  
Question : It is reported that on April 5 , a bus driver allegedly closed the boarding gate and started the bus without noticing that an elderly man was still boarding the bus .  As a result , the old man got his leg trapped by the boarding gate and was dragged along and injured , and it was found that no sensory device was installed on the boarding gate of the bus involved in the incident .  
One of the three officers injured during the incident has been treated and discharged while the remaining two listed in stable and satisfactory condition respectively in hospital .  
" From major disasters such as the Lan Kwai Fong incident , the Garley Building fire and the recent air crash at Chek Lap Kok , to smaller-scale ones such as wall collapses , localised landslides and flooding , they all require a swift and correctly structured response to enable the saving of life and at the same time enable speedy recovery from inevitable chaos , " Mr Cheung said .  
Of the eight workers injured in the fire incident , five have since been discharged while two are still being treated in hospital .  One of them is still in critical condition and the other is reported to be recovering in satisfactory condition .  
The last two months , in particular , are marked by a series of security events of diverse nature , ranging from the Hei Ling Chau prison riot ; to the Police 's use of pepper foam in handling the scuffle with demonstrators on 26th June ; the subsequent enquiry into the role played by students ; the hostage incident at the Hong Kong International Airport staged by a lone ' gunman ' ; and , of course , the suspected arson attack at Immigration Department on 2nd August .  
Respondents were asked how satisfied they were with the Police service provided via different points of contact .  They formed favourable views on five main areas of Police / public interaction .  In particular , respondents considered their experience with Police at incident scenes and with the 999 emergency telephone service as very positive with 88 per cent and 85 per cent ratings respectively .  
" The incident has also given rise to wide discussion and concerns both within the Force and amongst the community .  Force management fully appreciates the concerns expressed .  Whilst we are fully aware of the importance of internal communications , we are also cognizant of the fact that we are not perfect in all aspects .  All the views expressed will be carefully considered , " Mr Tsang said .  
The spokesman said that in the wake of the recent avian flu incident , the Government has enhanced the surveillance system on avian flu at all levels , including increasing the number of blood test at borders and wholesale markets , to make the surveillance programme extremely sensitive and effective .  " This will enable the Government to take appropriate follow-up actions once viruses are detected by the surveillance system , " he said .  
In the light of the on-going public concern relating to the disciplinary hearings on the incident of YU Man-hon , we are prepared to disclose , on an exceptional basis , in summary the facts that have been brought forward in the disciplinary hearings .  
She has white short hair and was wearing a light blue blouse , black trousers and a pair of brown slippers during the incident .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .  
" The Government has expressed grave concern over this incident .  We consider that such an act has damaged our social and moral values .  This is not acceptable and should be condemned by the society and subject to legal sanction .  
The deceased , with no identity document found on him , aged about 70 , is about 1.6 metres tall , of thin build and has short grey hair and moustache .  He was wearing a grey overcoat , blue shirt , a pair of grey trousers and black leather shoes during the incident .  
Upon receipt of such information , HKCERT will conduct technical analysis and risk assessment , and collate the findings into a clear and simple alert for dissemination to the public .  The alert will include a summary of the incident , relevant preventive and remedial measures , as well as technical recommendations .  The aim is to help the public understand the development and impact of the incident so that effective preventive and remedial actions can be taken .  
" Meanwhile , there is no evidence to suggest that Canadian beef still on sale in the local market is unsafe as the Alberta incident appears to be an isolated case and beef already arrived has been certified by the Canadian authority to be originated from BSE-free cattle and is fit for human consumption , " the spokesman emphasized .  
During the process , members met and discussed with a wide range of stakeholders and players in the incident , including legislators , hospital and public health authorities , Hospital Board members , local experts and academia , frontline health care workers and organisations as well as private practitioners , Amoy Gardens resident representatives , operators of old age homes , patient groups , media representatives and health care workers contracted SARS .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
The little incident described below is a classic anecdote of the Yu family . When their eldest son was born in Washington , D . C . , Mrs . Yu 's mother was unable to come all the way to the United States and help her daughter with the month of recuperation and special diet required by Chinese tradition . Mother-in-law then wrote to son-in-law exhorting him to be sure to stew a chicken for the postpartum mother , to help her regain her strength .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
We need to create a beneficial exchange , bringing in more information from abroad and putting out the story of our own cultural heritage , the sincerity of our efforts and our practical actions , to avoid a repeat of the rhino horn incident , with its hurt feelings , wasted energy and the risk that a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine may disappear . (  
Not so long ago , R . O . C . business-men were involved in the killing of seals in South Africa , which was followed by the rhino horn incident and the reckless killing of the black-faced spoonbill . These incidents have challenged the humane philosophy Chinese have traditionally held dear .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
In 1993 , another dinosaur incident on the mainland startled people worldwide . When digging , country folk in Hunan 's Xixia County accidentally came across " black stone eggs , " which they then went on to sell as an ingredient for Chinese medicine . It was only after thousands had been dug up and sold that a Nanjing customs inspector discovered that these black " stone eggs " were in fact being viewed as priceless dinosaur eggs elsewhere in the world !  
Although the Chinese communist authorities have already announced that they have arrested three suspects for robbing the passengers and burning the boat , the rigid attitude displayed by mainland China after the incident , their imperious obstruction of bereaved family members and reporters from Taiwan , and their sustained insistence that the incident was simply an accident , generated a strong reaction in Taiwan , where people moved to completely boycott cross-Strait exchanges .  
" This is because in the past in every medium of communication , the listener 's role was the smallest , " says " Nation United " host Ling Er-hsiang . Every time a major incident takes place , the media hurriedly interview government officials and expert scholars or elected representatives . " But really , the people are most important , not to mention the fact that the opinions of some common citizens are more outstanding and cut closer to reality . "  
A radio in every handIn the future shortwave broadcasting may be no competition for satellite TV , with its combined impact of both sound and image . But every time a major international incident occurs , the number of shortwave listeners increases .  
Lucy 's owner was frantic , not knowing what could be done to save her . Just then , there was an incident of a police dog killing one of the six ravens guarding the Tower of London . The dog was pardoned however , and the precedent spared Lucy the death penalty . This amusing incident happened in England , but was reported by media worldwide , attracting the attention of many animal lovers .  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Lately Taipei has been all abuzz over the " Lu An-ni incident . " Lu , a student who did not pass the examination to enter a doctoral program , accused professors who gave her the oral examination of plagiarism and sexual harassment . The professors responded that they had done nothing of the kind , and that Lu had an ulterior motive for making the charges .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
Recently another incident was big news : a Maori activist was caught trying to cut down the Monterey pine on One Tree Hill , which was planted last century by British settlers . The New Zealand government spent over NZ $ 10,000 to save the tree , but the Maori finally received a suspended sentence because the court was understanding of his feelings about history .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Most observers approved of Siew 's decisive handling of the case as maintaining the team spirit of the cabinet . Though Liao later made a strong statement attacking Siew and Control Yuan President Wang Tso-yung was also critical , the incident was settled in a short time due to Premier Siew 's actions .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
For example , in 1992 , before gay activism in Taiwan had really taken off , the group 's publication Girlfriend led the way in protesting the incident in which a Taiwan Television ( TTV ) news program surreptitiously filmed inside a lesbian bar , and another incident in which TTV interviewed the androgynous singer Pan Mei-cheng under false premises . The public came out solidly behind Girlfriend . Ultimately , the National Press Council of the ROC judged that TTV had handled the story improperly .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ? " asks Professor Lin Cheng-fang of National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering , giving FPG some backhanded credit for highlighting the issue .  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped . Underground parking-lots became underground reservoirs , and flooded transformer boxes blew out , cutting off electricity and water supplies to many buildings . In one dreadful incident , someone actually drowned while trying to get downstairs by elevator .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
Two years back Taiwan experienced a major earthquake . Last year there were landslides and massive flooding here , and also the horrific 911 incident in New York . And most recently Taiwan has faced a drought . Some of these are natural disasters , some are man-made , and some are natural disasters made worse by human action .  
In 1999 , the Japanese physician H . Takada isolated BPA from the umbilical cords of women giving birth at a clinic . In a previous incident , most primary and secondary schools in Nara , Japan stopped using melamine tableware after intense protests from parents , even though the manufacturer had established that the plates and bowls would not release BPA if the children did not scratch them with their cutlery .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
In response to questions raised by conservationists both in Taiwan and abroad , COA vice chairman Lee Jen-chyuan stated that this has been a painful experience , and demonstrated that the management of wildlife preserves had to be further improved . Lee also expressed the hope that the incident would encourage the people of Taiwan to give more thought to conservation .  
Regrettably , even as the country was getting tough on domestic quarantine , in mid-May a doctor from Mackay Memorial Hospital caused an international incident when he showed SARS symptoms while in Japan . Assuming that he only had the flu , he took some cold medicine and finished his travel itinerary , only later discovering that one of the patients he treated in hospital later died as a probable SARS victim .  
The incident was sparked when police stopped a pair of students from NTU and Taipei Teachers ' College for riding double on a bicycle . When the students proved uncooperative , the police beat and detained them , setting off a chain of events that eventually led to mass arrests by the military police .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking . During this time he immersed himself in the theory of political and social movements and laid a solid foundation for the future development of such activities in Taiwan .  
What 's more , criminal gangs began to control many of the venues , and related incidents were the subject of frequent unflattering press reports . Because of an underworld disagreement , gang leader Yang Shuang-wu shot and injured singer Kao Ling-feng at one such establishment in Kaohsiung . The incident shocked Taiwan , and many started to view these places as dens of iniquity . Attendance fell markedly .  
They soon sent out an expeditionary force to Taiwan , making representations to the Qing court with the excuse that the Chinese had done nothing about the incident . After the Japanese landed the " barbarian " villages surrendered one after the other . The Japanese troops set up camp nearby and planned on a long stay .  
Speaking of sports marketing , retired NBA star Michael Jordan recently ruffled feathers in Taiwan in a whirlwind stopover , ducking out of sight after a quick 90-second appearance before fans who had waited three hours to see him . High-flying Taiwan Nike eventually had to make a public apology for the fiasco . The company had thought to score a marketing coup on the strength of Jordan 's huge appeal , but the incident only proved that fans can put you on a pedestal , and fans can pull you back off it .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
Although in a letter dated 9 February addressed to MINUGUA , the URNG command denied responsibility for the incident and stated its determination to fulfil these commitments , there is reason to believe that the shot came from URNG lines , although it is true that the proximity of the fighting makes it difficult to judge whether the shot was intentional . 
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
The recent kidnapping incident appeared to put the peace process into question , but the Government as well as the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) clearly opted for peace , and we are pleased to note that partial agreements on pending issues such as the ceasefire , constitutional reform and the reintegration of URNG guerrillas into the political life of Guatemala will be signed in Oslo , Stockholm and Madrid respectively during the first half of December . We urge the parties to do their utmost to adhere to this programme . 
With regard to the ICAO investigation , although it is part of the United Nations manoeuvre to bring the incident before the Security Council , we are not afraid of it ; on the contrary , we accept it and we demand that it should be rapid and impartial , and that it should take into account all the background information and the gross provocations we are suffering from as a result of the repeated violation of our airspace and the risks they entailed to air traffic and to our country . 
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
It will be seen that the information contained in the Greek Cypriot representative 's aforementioned letter is deliberately wrong and is designed to mislead the world public opinion by exploiting such an unfortunate incident .  
If the enemies do not return our small submarine , survivors and the dead unconditionally while continuing to make ill use of the incident for the sinister political purpose , we will be forced to take strong countermeasures .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  NULLFinally , UNIFIL continued to make every effort to ensure security and protection of its staff :  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation , were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  
According to official and non _ government observers , the destruction of Babri Masjid was an incident , an aberration , the result of the political exploitation of religion by ultra _ nationalist political parties , and can not be interpreted as evidence of an official policy of religious intolerance directed against Muslims .  
The telephone numbers and addresses of those responsible shall be provided to the population through the mass media to be used by citizens in critical situations ; on receiving the signal , those responsible must arrive at the place of the incident accompanied by an expert doctor , a lawyer and the persons involved .  
However , my Office and the Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned that the authorities in west Mostar continue to ignore the international community 's demands that a full investigation and judicial proceedings based on new indictments be carried out in the cases of the three west Mostar policemen involved in the 10 February shooting incident , and that two other west Mostar policemen be suspended from their posts pending investigations into their involvement in the incident .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
In that report I stressed the exemplary conduct of the parties , which allowed the process to conclude without incident and within the agreed time span , as well as the remarkable cooperation of the international community which provided vital logistic support to the demobilization process .  
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
While appreciating the Governments replies to information he has transmitted , he is constrained to express his shock at the incident of 1 December 1997 which evidenced unprovoked and unrestrained brutality by the law enforcement officials involved , as well as at the allegations of judicial complicity in and aggravation of the cruelty of the events .  
UNIFIL has completed a full review of the damages resulting from the incident that occurred at Qana and the surrounding area on 18 April 1996 and identified the total costs directly attributable to the incident at $ 893,319 , comprising $ 552,474 in damages to the headquarters compound of the Fijian battalion and $ 340,845 in damages sustained in other surrounding positions in the UNIFIL area of operations .  
As the Commission may recall , in its previous statement on the question , the Indonesian Government unequivocally stressed that ' one particular problem in this matter is that many of those who were involved in the violent demonstrations leading to the incident have not come forward or have left the country clandestinely ' .  
The absence of any major incident during the entire process confirmed what had already been demonstrated by the flawless observance of the informal ceasefire since 19 March 1996 , namely , that in addition to their leadership , the combatants on both sides were convinced that the time for military confrontation was over .  
The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
The two sides further undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorized or unexplained incident that could create the risk of fallout with adverse consequences for both sides , or an outbreak of a nuclear war between the two countries , as well as to adopt measures aimed at diminishing the possibility of such actions , or of such incidents being misrepresented by the other .  
The representative of CSI acknowledged that the incident in question included a number of procedural errors as detailed in the formal written response submitted to the Committee .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
Alternative 2 : Calls on Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ,  
Alternative 1 : Calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response [ to natural disasters as well as the need to contain ] [ aimed at containing ] environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;

Under article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus , the murder of a representative of a foreign State with the aim of provoking a war or international incident is punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of 10 to 15 years or by death , and grievous bodily harm inflicted on such a representative with the same aim is punishable by deprivation of liberty for 8 to 15 years .  
In the document PGR explained the Acteal massacre as the culmination of long-standing and unresolved conflicts between local indigenous communities , and concluded that the authorities had contributed to the increasing tensions and insecurity by failing to take appropriate action to investigate a series of crimes committed in the region before the incident on 22 December 1997 .  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Further calls upon Member States to give priority to improving their emergency response capabilities and to increasing their participation in existing mechanisms so as to allow for a timely , effective and coordinated response to natural disasters and for the containment of environmental damage in the Caribbean Sea area in the event of an accident or incident relating to maritime transport ;  
Her Government had never received any complaint on the subject from any religious institution , whether in Angola or abroad , and no substantive evidence had been submitted as to the identity of the victims , the area in which the incident was alleged to have occurred , or the name of the congregation concerned .  
However , there are problems of protecting the individual in the event of biomedical experimentation , especially to ensure respect for the integrity of persons participating in such research and their free and informed consent based on an assessment of the risks involved , in order to avoid any untoward incident or undesirable effect .  
Examinations of detainees by medical doctors selected by them should be given weight in any court proceedings ( relating to the detainees or to officials accused of torture or ill-treatment ) equivalent to that accorded to officially employed or selected doctors having comparable qualifications ; the police bringing a detainee to a medical examination should never be those involved in the arrest or questioning of the detainees or the investigation of the incident provoking the detention .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
It is proposed to strengthen the Training Unit by two Professional ( 1 P-3 and 1-P-2 ) and one Security Service post to provide more comprehensive central training for security officers seconded or appointed to new and / or expanded peacekeeping operations on firearms qualification and certification , incident command system , dignitary protection , advanced security skills , United Nations use-of-force policy , emergency operations , investigations , fire and safety regulations , defensive tactics and advance first-aid provision .
