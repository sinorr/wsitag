It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
We should not ignore concrete requirements and " minor issues " in the daily lives of the masses .  For instance , leaders should be concerned about whether the food provided in the canteens at grassroots units is satisfactory or not , whether officers and soldiers have already observed their due holidays or not , whether problems in employment and education of their dependents have been solved or not .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
The draft legislative law submitted for deliberations today , in accordance with the Constitution , provides more specific provisions regarding the basic principles to be observed in legislative work , and the respective scopes of authority , enactment procedures and applicable rules for laws , administrative laws and regulations , local ordinances , regulations on the exercise of autonomy , and special regulations .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .

When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
It is precisely because the United Nations has observed the purpose of the charter in safeguarding peace , developing friendship , and promoting cooperation and the norms of international relations - - with equality of sovereignty and mutual noninterference in internal affairs as the core - - that the United Nations has continually developed and grown over the past 55 years , increasing its member states from 51 to 189 , and plays an irreplaceable role in world affairs .  
When this conception is eventually turned into a " sacred and inviolable " creed being commonly accepted and observed in society , all original " negative complexes " are also accepted and contained by the common ideology in society .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman observed that the volume of total retail sales continued to record a double-digit decline in March 1998 over a year earlier , due to the protracted weakness in inbound tourism and subdued local consumer demand .  
The Principal Environmental Protection Officer , Mr Pang Sik-wing said : " This air pollution level was observed at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represents the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .

Miss Chan said a few underlying principles must be observed in considering the four options .  They are : ( 1 ) the aim to save jobs and improve unemployment ; ( 2 ) the need to ensure employees ' statutory entitlements are not impaired ; ( 3 ) that the PWIF must stay financially sound at all times and ( 4 ) that no public funds should be used to finance the PWIF should it run into financial difficulties as a result of payment made to employees in cases of corporate rescue .  
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive signs emerging more recently , including improved liquidity from the earlier tight situation , successive cuts in local interest rates , and rebound in share prices and flat prices .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman observed that , comparing August with July 1999 , the larger year-on-year decreases in the CPIs were largely attributable to a further marked decline in their private housing rental component , as the earlier considerable declines in market rentals filtered through . 
On the other hand , the average wage rates for 17% of the companies still recorded some increase in June 1999 as compared with March 1999 .  This was partly attributable to the corporate restructuring observed for some of the companies over the past year or so , which resulted in retaining the more experienced and better skilled workers , and retrenching those of lesser experience and skill .  
On the other hand , the average wage rates for 40% of the companies surveyed still recorded some increase in September 1999 over a year earlier .  This was partly attributable to the corporate restructuring observed for some of the companies over the past year or so , which resulted in retaining the more experienced and better skilled workers at relatively higher pay , and retrenching those of lesser experience and skill at lower pay .  
Members considered the results of a number of simulations under the model and observed that , while they were not a perfect substitute for historical experience , simulations offered two main advantages : they allowed operations to be tested under extreme conditions ; and they provided opportunities to experiment with the design of the system .  
The spokesman also observed a continued rise in imports retained for local use , reflecting a sustained pick-up in domestic demand upon the economic revival .  
A more distinct increase was observed in the wholesale , retail , import / export trades , restaurants and hotels sector , attributable mainly to increased payment of bonuses or commissions by some trading companies .  Yet for the community , social and personal services sector , a year-on-year decrease of 1.1% was recorded .  
Directors observed that Hong Kong SAR 's rules-based approach to economic policy has been effective and reiterated their strong support for the linked exchange rate system , which has been underpinned by commodity and factor price flexibility in the domestic market and continues to provide a stable and transparent policy framework . 
In fact , prior to the discovery of the problem in bearing No . 42 , minor plastic extrusion of about 30mm in length was observed in two adjacent bearings in 1998 and Highways Department has since listed these 2 bearings as outstanding works to be rectified by the contractor .  
In reflecting on the changing mood of the community and shifting priorities of the Government , Mr Chiu observed : " Since the handover , there has been a greater interest and desire on the part of both the Government and the public to preserve and convert Hong Kong 's archeological heritage into ' living relics ' so that they become an integral part of the community and not just untouchable display items . " 
Comparing February - April 2002 with January - March 2002 , the unemployment rate ( not seasonally adjusted ) rose across many major economic sectors , including decoration and maintenance , manufacturing , restaurants , financing , sanitary services , education services and recreational services .  This more than offset the declines observed in foundation and superstructure construction , communications and real estate .  
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
During his military career , Hau cultivated a broad understanding of international politics , foreign affairs , science and technology , and social and mainland affairs , but observed a strict separation between the military and politics .  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
Nearly all the flower truck show proprietors were reluctant to be interviewed , especially those who provided " extra spicy " evening shows . In order to hunt them down . we resorted to the help of folklore expert Huang Wen-po , who has long observed the flower truck shows . Our car was rushing through the pitch dark salt fields and farmland , aiming toward the far-off impromptu show grounds , where neon light flashed and music reverberated in the air .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
He said he believed that as long as the state leaders and politicians in both China and Japan strictly observed the principles and spirit contained in the three documents and properly handled existing and emerging problems , a healthy and stable China Japan relationship can move forward into the 21st century  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
The objective is to achieve a rapid and substantial reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality , reducing the differences observed between developing and developed countries , and to eliminate all deaths from unsafe abortion .  
In its opinion , the Committee first observed that if members of a jury were suspected of displaying or voicing racial bias against an accused , it was incumbent upon the judicial authorities of the State party concerned to investigate the issue and to disqualify the juror , if there was a suspicion that the juror might be biased .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
The national euphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic dictatorship or from a deliberate choice , through legal processes , to change a form of government is , in most cases , as we have observed in the last few years , soon dissipated by a realization that making a democracy work is not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government .  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
In the Final Declaration of the First Review Conference ( 1975 ) , 2 / which was adopted by consensus , the participants stated that the obligations undertaken under articles I and II of the Treaty had been faithfully observed by all parties , and that the continued strict observance of those articles remained central to the shared objective of averting the further proliferation of nuclear weapons .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
The impact , observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths , produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet ; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth . 
Accordingly , full implementation and realization of the Declaration calls for a genuine democratization of international economic and political relations , a process that will negate the adverse consequences of the current process of globalization and foster a new climate of solidarity and international cooperation , in keeping with the growing interdependence observed world wide .  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
This study observed that " effective cooperation should build on complementarity in types of activity , modes of operation and length of commitment with roles , responsibilities and comparative advantages identified at an early stage of an operation " , with a word of caution against " measures which may diffuse the specific mandates and competencies of agencies , experience from CIREFCA and others have rejected a linear conceptual approach to the continuum from relief to development " .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The need for specific policies to be observed was expressed by one State ( Canada ) , which , in proposing an alternative formulation for article 7 , suggested that States should have in place post-employment compliance measures designed to reduce to a minimum , without unduly restricting former employees in seeking employment , the possibility of conflict of interest , preferential treatment or unfair advantage .  NULLComments on article 8 were provided by 16 States .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .  
For the moment , he has observed that since its colonization , Colombia has experienced persistent racial discrimination : the indigenous population and Black people have been marginalized , and live in deplorable economic and social conditions - they are the poorest groups .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations . 
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 13 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
The apparent dissolution of nation states in the economic sphere , the apparent absence of barriers to capital and its uncontrolled international mobility are beginning to produce multiple reactions that can be observed with increasing frequency throughout the world .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Considering that the cost-effectiveness of space technology applications had been demonstrated in several application domains for improving infrastructures , the participants observed that specific and focused cooperative efforts should be made by international organizations and by national entities to promote the use of appropriate technologies .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .  
The Independent Expert observed the progress made with regard to civil and political rights , identified weaknesses in the justice system and public security and drew attention to the need to find lasting solutions to problems affecting economic and social rights .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
In general , receiving departments have accepted the Investigations Section \ x { e5b8 } recommendations , but implementation is delayed for reasons that include the need to obtain additional legal advice on implementation methods and processes ; administrative and / or disciplinary processes are begun that take protracted periods of time ; financial implications are assessed ; and all due process requirements are observed .  
As has been observed even in Europe , which is the most advanced along the road to regional consolidation , and where economic and monetary union have become a reality , in the European Union there is no agreement on the rotational model .  
As the expert had already observed , the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable judicial system available to all .  
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
It was observed that , whichever term was selected , it was essential to clarify the legal consequences arising from the violation of the two categories of rules and to determine the degrees of responsibility in each case , in order to establish an objective criterion based not on the damage or blame ( dolus or culpa ) , but rather on the magnitude of the wrongful act and its effects . 
It was also observed that the incompatibility of a reservation with the object and purpose of a treaty should be decided in an objective way according to more clearly defined criteria ; to leave this matter entirely in the hands of States parties was not always satisfactory and sometimes could be confusing , although it was the exclusive responsibility of the State itself to rectify the defect in the expression of its consent to be bound .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .  
In accordance with its mandate , the Mission is required to verify both that due process is observed and that the competent national bodies carry out such investigations as may be required in an independent and effective manner , in accordance with the Constitution and with international human rights norms .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
In addition , it was observed that the result would rather be that the draft Convention validated such assignments , as a matter of civil or commercial law , while leaving to other law specific challenges to their validity ( e.g . , the invalidation of an assignment made within the suspect period before the opening of an insolvency proceeding as a fraudulent or preferential transfer ) . 
Moreover , it was observed that such a rule would not infringe on national practices , since , even in jurisdictions in which the notion of proceeds was unknown , cash receipts held in a separate account by an assignor acting as a fiduciary of an assignee were considered not to be part of the assignors estate .  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
advertising activities on the Internet for the promotion of any form of goods or services , set standards of ethical conduct to be observed by all advertisers and marketers to increase the public 's confidence in marketing in the interactive media , to safeguard advertisers ' freedom of expression , to minimize the incentive for governmental regulation , and to meet reasonable consumer privacy expectations . 
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
Nevertheless , determined as I believe we should be to go ahead , undeterred by the intimidation , and in view of the need to adhere to the shortest possible time-frame , I have decided to begin the registration , based on positive assurances by the Indonesian authorities , on the condition that meaningful , visible improvements in the security situation will be observed in the immediate future .  
As to the concept of circumstances precluding wrongfulness , the Special Rapporteur observed that the initial proposition was that the draft articles were not concerned with formulating the content of primary rules , but with the framework of secondary rules of responsibility , yet it was the primary rules which determined what was wrongful .  
In any legislative , administrative or other measures taken at the national , regional or international level , it should be ensured that the principles listed below are strictly observed :

In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
There were only 90 Dobson units total column ozone at the centre , almost all lower stratospheric ozone was destroyed , and about one third of the total ozone in the middle stratosphere was unaffected . 73 This is a reduction of about 70 per cent of the total ozone in years prior to when the hole was first observed . 75 The region of enhanced ozone destruction is mainly confined to the area polewards from about latitude 60 degrees south . 
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
The Special Rapporteur has observed , in most cases , systematic selection of individual victims or groups of victims , based on what appears to be intelligence on their career or backgrounds : university professors , medical personnel , persons who replaced Albanian workers fired in 1991 / 92 , even elderly spouses of former minor politicians or business executives have been targeted . 
Significant regularities observed in countries belonging to each of the really existing systemic families led to a comparative assessment where favourable , and adverse trends were mixed on both sides , making objective economic comparison more difficult ( see table 2 ) .  
At 1425 hours an Iranian helicopter was observed opposite our units at coordinates 9773 , flying at medium altitude east to west , then north along the border line , from which it was 50 metres distant .  
In the sense of paragraph 8 of Commission resolution 1999 / 34 , the most important legal means concern those arising from penal law as provided for in the Peruvian Penal Code ( Legislative Decree No . 635 ) which permit administrative or judicial orders to characterize and sanction acts as crimes , because it is only once criminal acts are determined as such in light of the facts that an omission to prosecute and punish can be observed to generate impunity .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of average and low income earners and to encourage equitable distribution of goods and services in the economic and social sector without excluding the customary and traditional values observed by communities , and to integrate programmes and activities in a manageable manner to ensure that strong community participation , commitment and ownership in various development areas can and will continue to be sustained .

Regrettably , it was observed , some of the psycho-social programmes established in the past had separated children from the community and had been designed in such a way that they actually increased the level of trauma and anxiety experienced by the intended beneficiaries .  
On 6 January 1993 , the United States , the United Kingdom and France each handed our Permanent Representative in New York a written position in which , after making reference to the imposition of a no-fly zone south of parallel 32 , they stated that Iraqi military aircraft had been recurrently observed in the said zone in violation of the no-fly zone and that Iraq had moved SAM missile batteries to new sites south of parallel 32 , thus posing a threat to the aircraft of those States .  
They stressed that the principle of refraining from the use or threat of force or any other means of coercion or compulsion set forth in the Charter was binding , must be observed by all States and entailed a categorical prohibition on the use of any military-coercive action or any other type of action such as blockades , embargoes or other measures not approved by the international community.Exceptions to that prohibition are clearly and expressly stated in the Charter itself .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
A deterministic analytical model of debris has also been developed in order to allow computational tracking of the movement of individual large observed space objects with given orbital characteristics .  
We have observed that the continent inherited a myriad of ills from the colonial past , which fundamentally affected the social , political and economic foundations of its society , thus constraining its present capacity for stability and development .  
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
The States members of MERCOSUR and the associated countries considered that the strictest safety requirements should be observed in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , which posed great danger to the marine environment and the health of populations in affected areas .  
On the contrary , it has been observed that secured creditors generally require only that the insolvency regime be sufficiently fair and predictable to instil in them the belief that their security rights , if properly created , will ultimately be enforceable against the collateral within a reasonable time frame , without excessive cost and without being subject to unanticipated competing claims .  
However , it has been observed that the existence of mechanisms that may affect a creditors ability to deal with its collateral will not generally deter a lender from extending credit as long as the lender can develop a sufficient degree of comfort that the insolvency laws will be enforced in a reasonably predictable and transparent manner , that the lender will be compensated in a fair way for the diminution in value of its collateral and that the lender will ultimately be able to realize upon its collateral within a reasonable period of time .  
He acknowledged that the increasing sophistication and complexity of TCDC activities , greater regional and inter-country cooperation among developing countries , increased resource allocations for TCDC by developing countries , greater emphasis on long-term cooperation and enhanced modalities of triangular cooperation marked the maturity of the emerging trends in the area of TCDC observed in the previous biennium .  
The delegation of authority to senior managers was rarely respected and observed ; actions formally approved could be revised at the last moment ; and consultative input into executive decision-making was brought to a minimum .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) , stated that although the economic concerns of the least developed countries had been at the forefront of the development debate for more than three decades , the results were not encouraging .  He observed that the Brussels Declaration provided hope that the next decade would be different from the previous two .  
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .  
It is necessary to reiterate time and again and earnestly put into practice the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , persistent peaceful settlement of international disputes , sovereign equality of all countries , respect for the national conditions of countries , seeking common ground while shelving differences , and the principle of closer mutually-beneficial cooperation for common development .  All these principles should be observed by each and every country .  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .  
Academician Pan said : With regard to the chronic effect of radiation , on the basis of analyzing and studying large amounts of the existing data , the UN Scientific Committee on the Radiation Effect of Atomic Energy has drawn a conclusion : apart from an increase in thyroid gland cancer observed among children exposed to radiation , no major members of the public have been found to be physically affected in relation to ionizing radiation 14 years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
We should not ignore concrete requirements and " minor issues " in the daily lives of the masses .  For instance , leaders should be concerned about whether the food provided in the canteens at grassroots units is satisfactory or not , whether officers and soldiers have already observed their due holidays or not , whether problems in employment and education of their dependents have been solved or not .  
After the plane collision incident , China coolly observed development of the incident and calmly dealt with it , firmly ensuring China 's sovereignty and national dignity , and did its best to take care of the general interests of Sino-US relations .  China 's attitude was neither humble nor arrogant , enabling China to very well maneuver the complicated and tense situation .  
The draft legislative law submitted for deliberations today , in accordance with the Constitution , provides more specific provisions regarding the basic principles to be observed in legislative work , and the respective scopes of authority , enactment procedures and applicable rules for laws , administrative laws and regulations , local ordinances , regulations on the exercise of autonomy , and special regulations .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .

When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
It is precisely because the United Nations has observed the purpose of the charter in safeguarding peace , developing friendship , and promoting cooperation and the norms of international relations - - with equality of sovereignty and mutual noninterference in internal affairs as the core - - that the United Nations has continually developed and grown over the past 55 years , increasing its member states from 51 to 189 , and plays an irreplaceable role in world affairs .  
When this conception is eventually turned into a " sacred and inviolable " creed being commonly accepted and observed in society , all original " negative complexes " are also accepted and contained by the common ideology in society .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman observed that the volume of total retail sales continued to record a double-digit decline in March 1998 over a year earlier , due to the protracted weakness in inbound tourism and subdued local consumer demand .  
The Principal Environmental Protection Officer , Mr Pang Sik-wing said : " This air pollution level was observed at the Causeway Bay Roadside Air Quality Station , which represents the urban roadside in busy commercial area with very heavy traffic and surrounded by many tall buildings . 
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .

Miss Chan said a few underlying principles must be observed in considering the four options .  They are : ( 1 ) the aim to save jobs and improve unemployment ; ( 2 ) the need to ensure employees ' statutory entitlements are not impaired ; ( 3 ) that the PWIF must stay financially sound at all times and ( 4 ) that no public funds should be used to finance the PWIF should it run into financial difficulties as a result of payment made to employees in cases of corporate rescue .  
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive signs emerging more recently , including improved liquidity from the earlier tight situation , successive cuts in local interest rates , and rebound in share prices and flat prices .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman observed that , comparing August with July 1999 , the larger year-on-year decreases in the CPIs were largely attributable to a further marked decline in their private housing rental component , as the earlier considerable declines in market rentals filtered through . 
On the other hand , the average wage rates for 17% of the companies still recorded some increase in June 1999 as compared with March 1999 .  This was partly attributable to the corporate restructuring observed for some of the companies over the past year or so , which resulted in retaining the more experienced and better skilled workers , and retrenching those of lesser experience and skill .  
On the other hand , the average wage rates for 40% of the companies surveyed still recorded some increase in September 1999 over a year earlier .  This was partly attributable to the corporate restructuring observed for some of the companies over the past year or so , which resulted in retaining the more experienced and better skilled workers at relatively higher pay , and retrenching those of lesser experience and skill at lower pay .  
Members considered the results of a number of simulations under the model and observed that , while they were not a perfect substitute for historical experience , simulations offered two main advantages : they allowed operations to be tested under extreme conditions ; and they provided opportunities to experiment with the design of the system .  
The spokesman also observed a continued rise in imports retained for local use , reflecting a sustained pick-up in domestic demand upon the economic revival .  
A more distinct increase was observed in the wholesale , retail , import / export trades , restaurants and hotels sector , attributable mainly to increased payment of bonuses or commissions by some trading companies .  Yet for the community , social and personal services sector , a year-on-year decrease of 1.1% was recorded .  
Directors observed that Hong Kong SAR 's rules-based approach to economic policy has been effective and reiterated their strong support for the linked exchange rate system , which has been underpinned by commodity and factor price flexibility in the domestic market and continues to provide a stable and transparent policy framework . 
In fact , prior to the discovery of the problem in bearing No . 42 , minor plastic extrusion of about 30mm in length was observed in two adjacent bearings in 1998 and Highways Department has since listed these 2 bearings as outstanding works to be rectified by the contractor .  
In reflecting on the changing mood of the community and shifting priorities of the Government , Mr Chiu observed : " Since the handover , there has been a greater interest and desire on the part of both the Government and the public to preserve and convert Hong Kong 's archeological heritage into ' living relics ' so that they become an integral part of the community and not just untouchable display items . " 
Comparing February - April 2002 with January - March 2002 , the unemployment rate ( not seasonally adjusted ) rose across many major economic sectors , including decoration and maintenance , manufacturing , restaurants , financing , sanitary services , education services and recreational services .  This more than offset the declines observed in foundation and superstructure construction , communications and real estate .  
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
During his military career , Hau cultivated a broad understanding of international politics , foreign affairs , science and technology , and social and mainland affairs , but observed a strict separation between the military and politics .  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
Nearly all the flower truck show proprietors were reluctant to be interviewed , especially those who provided " extra spicy " evening shows . In order to hunt them down . we resorted to the help of folklore expert Huang Wen-po , who has long observed the flower truck shows . Our car was rushing through the pitch dark salt fields and farmland , aiming toward the far-off impromptu show grounds , where neon light flashed and music reverberated in the air .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Just as Emotional Intelligence author Daniel Goleman has observed , many social phenomena of the last few decades have revealed that neither academic achievement nor professional ability are the sole factors leading to success . Especially in modern corporations which emphasize organizational management , such qualities as emotional balance , personability and leadership are frequently more important .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society . But more important is the true " cultural friendship " which has been the major factor supporting and encouraging me during my study abroad .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
As admirable as the accomplishments of modern-day astronomers , are those of their ancient Chinese counterparts . Long ago , our ancestors understood how to read the astronomical clock , and elaborated on real and perceived connections between celestial and human events . In those days , virtually everyone had some understanding of the heavens . Astronomers observed , recorded , and pondered the significance of celestial phenomena , and knowledge of astronomy affected the actions of rulers .  
( " Long-period " comets come from a more distant , spherical region-the Oort Cloud . ) From ground-based observations and space missions , astronomers have already gained a degree of understanding of the more massive bodies in the solar system , and their satellites . But because the bodies at the outer limits of the solar system are of such small diameter and low brightness , they are not easily observed , and can only be studied if they move into orbits that bring them closer to the sun , as comets .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
Yushan National Park is crowded with peaks , and crisscrossed by river valleys , making the terrain highly varied . Additionally , vegetation zones with hot , warm , cool , and cold climates can be found at different altitudes . As a result , except for the tropical plants along the coast , virtually all the types of vegetation found in Taiwan can be observed . It is little wonder that Yushan is such a haven for botanical researchers .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
In the era of the knowledge-based economy , ideas are the ultimate source of profits . However , Hsu has observed that Taiwanese children growing up under the rigid educational system have lost out on many opportunities for hands-on learning and learning by doing , making it very difficult to spark creative ideas .  
He said he believed that as long as the state leaders and politicians in both China and Japan strictly observed the principles and spirit contained in the three documents and properly handled existing and emerging problems , a healthy and stable China Japan relationship can move forward into the 21st century  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
The objective is to achieve a rapid and substantial reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality , reducing the differences observed between developing and developed countries , and to eliminate all deaths from unsafe abortion .  
In its opinion , the Committee first observed that if members of a jury were suspected of displaying or voicing racial bias against an accused , it was incumbent upon the judicial authorities of the State party concerned to investigate the issue and to disqualify the juror , if there was a suspicion that the juror might be biased .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
The national euphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic dictatorship or from a deliberate choice , through legal processes , to change a form of government is , in most cases , as we have observed in the last few years , soon dissipated by a realization that making a democracy work is not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government .  
Reaffirm and promote all human rights , which are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights , and strive to ensure that they are respected , protected and observed .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
In the Final Declaration of the First Review Conference ( 1975 ) , 2 / which was adopted by consensus , the participants stated that the obligations undertaken under articles I and II of the Treaty had been faithfully observed by all parties , and that the continued strict observance of those articles remained central to the shared objective of averting the further proliferation of nuclear weapons .  
In the Final Declaration , adopted by consensus , the Conference reaffirmed the strong common interest of the States parties in preventing the use of environmental modification techniques for military or any other hostile purposes and confirmed that the obligations assumed under the ENMOD Convention had been faithfully observed .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
Further took note of the gradual shift of focus from pollution control and waste management to pollution prevention approaches in policies and programmes at the country level and bilateral and multilateral cooperation , and observed that this shift has resulted in the introduction of production patterns that emphasize the more efficient use of raw materials and energy , taking into account the capture and recycling of wastes and the better use of end-products of the productive system ;  
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
The impact , observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths , produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet ; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth . 
Accordingly , full implementation and realization of the Declaration calls for a genuine democratization of international economic and political relations , a process that will negate the adverse consequences of the current process of globalization and foster a new climate of solidarity and international cooperation , in keeping with the growing interdependence observed world wide .  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
In this setting , on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we observed and took part in a series of momentous statements on the universal nature of this Organization , as well as the formulation of solemn commitments to the principles and purposes that have guided and should continue to guide the future work of the United Nations . However , predictably , during the past year the purposes and principles that have guided us for over 50 years have once again undergone unilateral interpretation . 
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
This study observed that " effective cooperation should build on complementarity in types of activity , modes of operation and length of commitment with roles , responsibilities and comparative advantages identified at an early stage of an operation " , with a word of caution against " measures which may diffuse the specific mandates and competencies of agencies , experience from CIREFCA and others have rejected a linear conceptual approach to the continuum from relief to development " .  
A number of scenarios of future world transportation demand prepared by IIASA suggest that based on current policies , recent observed trend increases in mobility and changes in transportation modes will dominate the evolution of fuel efficiency , which implies the growth of global transportation energy demand at more or less similar ( linear ) rates as in previous decades .  
The need for specific policies to be observed was expressed by one State ( Canada ) , which , in proposing an alternative formulation for article 7 , suggested that States should have in place post-employment compliance measures designed to reduce to a minimum , without unduly restricting former employees in seeking employment , the possibility of conflict of interest , preferential treatment or unfair advantage .  NULLComments on article 8 were provided by 16 States .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .

AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations . 
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 13 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .  
In my report of 1 October , I observed that the Haitian National Police had not reached the level of experience and confidence required to control and defeat threats posed by subversive groups , and that it was clear , therefore , that the presence of the UNSMIH military element was a key factor in the ability of the Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
In response to that suggestion it was observed that in legal systems that recognized insolvency proceedings of natural persons , such as individual traders or merchants , it would sometimes be difficult to establish a clear distinction between the debtors business and personal affairs , and that proceedings apparently falling in the latter category might well have influence on the debtors assets and liabilities .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
First , the Court strengthened basic rules of international humanitarian law when it affirmed that the prohibition of the use of weapons , projectiles or materials that may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects among combatants and civilians is to be observed by all States , whether or not they have ratified the conventions to that effect , because it constitutes an inviolable principle of customary international law . 
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
At the beginning of the current decade , economic growth proved to be lower than projected in the baseline economic growth scenario , which was drawn up in the light of the trends observed during the period 1980-1990 and on which the traffic projections are based .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
The apparent dissolution of nation states in the economic sphere , the apparent absence of barriers to capital and its uncontrolled international mobility are beginning to produce multiple reactions that can be observed with increasing frequency throughout the world .  
Pressure for " concrete " results is observed and behavioural models are sought among " profit-making " enterprises without there necessarily being any understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of the processes of human and community development , which by definition cover a more prolonged timespan .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
Considering that the cost-effectiveness of space technology applications had been demonstrated in several application domains for improving infrastructures , the participants observed that specific and focused cooperative efforts should be made by international organizations and by national entities to promote the use of appropriate technologies .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
It has been observed that the over-regulated labour market in Latin America has entrenched labour market dualism between a highly protected urban formal sector and a largely unprotected informal sector , thus impeded labour market adjustment to changing market forces .

Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
It was observed that the Declaration of the Venice Commission contained detailed provisions on the right of option and also included a new rule which , however , was in conformity with international standards of human rights , providing that the exercise of the right of option must have no prejudicial consequences for the persons concerned , particularly with regard to their right to residence in the successor State and their movable or immovable property located therein .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
It was soon observed afterwards that the fears of the former and the hypocrisy of the latter very rapidly became a source of massive and grave violations of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment .  
Looking towards the future , he observed that this trend may very well continue but stressed that as intrastate conflicts increased , intensive peacekeeping efforts by the international community would be necessary , followed by long-term programmes to strengthen the foundations of peace .  
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
In general , receiving departments have accepted the Investigations Section \ x { e5b8 } recommendations , but implementation is delayed for reasons that include the need to obtain additional legal advice on implementation methods and processes ; administrative and / or disciplinary processes are begun that take protracted periods of time ; financial implications are assessed ; and all due process requirements are observed .

It was observed that , whichever term was selected , it was essential to clarify the legal consequences arising from the violation of the two categories of rules and to determine the degrees of responsibility in each case , in order to establish an objective criterion based not on the damage or blame ( dolus or culpa ) , but rather on the magnitude of the wrongful act and its effects . 
It was also observed that the incompatibility of a reservation with the object and purpose of a treaty should be decided in an objective way according to more clearly defined criteria ; to leave this matter entirely in the hands of States parties was not always satisfactory and sometimes could be confusing , although it was the exclusive responsibility of the State itself to rectify the defect in the expression of its consent to be bound .  
It had been observed , for example , that Governments should have been more involved from the very beginning of the process , including in the preparation of the common country assessments ; that a way must be found to involve civil society and non-governmental organizations ; and that UNDAF should be introduced gradually , so that experience could be absorbed as the process unfolded , and the lessons learned could be applied to the planning of future activities .

Moreover , it was observed that such a rule would not infringe on national practices , since , even in jurisdictions in which the notion of proceeds was unknown , cash receipts held in a separate account by an assignor acting as a fiduciary of an assignee were considered not to be part of the assignors estate .  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
advertising activities on the Internet for the promotion of any form of goods or services , set standards of ethical conduct to be observed by all advertisers and marketers to increase the public 's confidence in marketing in the interactive media , to safeguard advertisers ' freedom of expression , to minimize the incentive for governmental regulation , and to meet reasonable consumer privacy expectations . 
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .

There were only 90 Dobson units total column ozone at the centre , almost all lower stratospheric ozone was destroyed , and about one third of the total ozone in the middle stratosphere was unaffected . 73 This is a reduction of about 70 per cent of the total ozone in years prior to when the hole was first observed . 75 The region of enhanced ozone destruction is mainly confined to the area polewards from about latitude 60 degrees south . 
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
The Special Rapporteur has observed , in most cases , systematic selection of individual victims or groups of victims , based on what appears to be intelligence on their career or backgrounds : university professors , medical personnel , persons who replaced Albanian workers fired in 1991 / 92 , even elderly spouses of former minor politicians or business executives have been targeted .

In the sense of paragraph 8 of Commission resolution 1999 / 34 , the most important legal means concern those arising from penal law as provided for in the Peruvian Penal Code ( Legislative Decree No . 635 ) which permit administrative or judicial orders to characterize and sanction acts as crimes , because it is only once criminal acts are determined as such in light of the facts that an omission to prosecute and punish can be observed to generate impunity .  
It was observed that the draft convention was an important complement to the existing anti-terrorist conventions , providing an effective legal framework for combating and discouraging acts of nuclear terrorism , which posed a real threat to the maintenance of international peace and security .

Regrettably , it was observed , some of the psycho-social programmes established in the past had separated children from the community and had been designed in such a way that they actually increased the level of trauma and anxiety experienced by the intended beneficiaries .  
On 6 January 1993 , the United States , the United Kingdom and France each handed our Permanent Representative in New York a written position in which , after making reference to the imposition of a no-fly zone south of parallel 32 , they stated that Iraqi military aircraft had been recurrently observed in the said zone in violation of the no-fly zone and that Iraq had moved SAM missile batteries to new sites south of parallel 32 , thus posing a threat to the aircraft of those States .  
They stressed that the principle of refraining from the use or threat of force or any other means of coercion or compulsion set forth in the Charter was binding , must be observed by all States and entailed a categorical prohibition on the use of any military-coercive action or any other type of action such as blockades , embargoes or other measures not approved by the international community.Exceptions to that prohibition are clearly and expressly stated in the Charter itself .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .

However , it has been observed that the existence of mechanisms that may affect a creditors ability to deal with its collateral will not generally deter a lender from extending credit as long as the lender can develop a sufficient degree of comfort that the insolvency laws will be enforced in a reasonably predictable and transparent manner , that the lender will be compensated in a fair way for the diminution in value of its collateral and that the lender will ultimately be able to realize upon its collateral within a reasonable period of time .  
He acknowledged that the increasing sophistication and complexity of TCDC activities , greater regional and inter-country cooperation among developing countries , increased resource allocations for TCDC by developing countries , greater emphasis on long-term cooperation and enhanced modalities of triangular cooperation marked the maturity of the emerging trends in the area of TCDC observed in the previous biennium .

The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
It was further observed that the fight against terrorism required a global effort based on international cooperation and international law , with due regard for human rights , and that it must go hand in hand with the search for lasting solutions to the human tragedies and political problems contributing to the instability which nurtured terrorist groups .
