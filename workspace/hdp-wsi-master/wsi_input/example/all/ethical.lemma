For this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .  Wei Jianxing emphasized : All the township ( town ) leading cadres across the country should keep firmly in mind the party 's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
Fourth , all localities in Guangdong must constantly enhance the ideological and ethical qualities , as well as the scientific and cultural qualities , of the people ; strengthen the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and bring about a well-coordinated economic and social development .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
To comprehensively implement the CPC 's education policy , schools of various levels and categories citywide must organically integrate ethical , intellectual , and physical education into all aspects of education activities to create a situation of mutual infiltration and coordinated development , so as to advance the comprehensive growth of students .  
Teachers are engineers of human souls ; improving teachers ' ideological and political qualities and ethics cultivation will be of decisive significance to the comprehensive ethical , intellectual , physical , and aesthetic development of children and youths and to training qualified personnel for modernization construction .  
The basic purpose of this " three stresses " positive education among all army 's Party organizations is through centralized and general education to practically strengthen grass-roots Party organizations ' cohesive force and combat capability , enhance Party members ' political steadfastness and ethical purity , bring into full play the grass-roots Party organizations ' role of fighting force and the exemplary vanguard role of the Party members , and further consolidate foundations of the Party 's absolute leadership over the army .  
The group of songs reflects the basic ethical demands on the revolutionary military personnel in the new period and is the vivid teaching material to enhance the troop units ' ideological and political building .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
The circular also called on various units to make good use of the compact discs distributed by the General Political Department to teach the singing of those songs , to organize literary and artistic workers to go deep among the troops to help train key cadres , to provide guidance for officers and men in learning to sing , and to bring about the singing of the songs to uplift the ethical standards of military personnel resonate in all barracks via organizing singing contest , holding evening parties , closed circuit television , and cable television .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
The scale of these building activities is large , and they have broad impact .  They have raised the level of civilization in the cities and the ethical quality of the citizens and played a positive promotional role for the stability of reform and development .  
Centered on establishing the correct world view , view of life and values , we must combine inheriting the fine traditions with promoting the spirit of the age , integrate respect for the legitimate rights of the individual with shouldering social responsibilities , coordinate attention to efficiency with upholding social fairness , combine progressive demands with broad demands , and make efforts to form healthy , harmonious , and upwardly progressive ideological and ethical standards commensurate with economic and social development .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
To wallow in heresy will make a person lose his will and freedom , one will be susceptible to hallucination , panic , schizophrenia , guilty feeling , self-doubt about one 's status which eventually will lead to one 's inability to establish mutually accommodating and close relations with others , deteriorating intellectual power and sense of humor , weakening fitness and power of judgment , and disruption of ethical family relations and economic loss .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
Jiang Zemin inspected the building on 16 June . He exhorted the responsible comrades concerned to do a good job in building and managing the hall , turn it into an important window for imparting scientific thinking , spirit , knowledge , and methods , and make it play a positive role in enhancing the masses ' ideological and ethical qualities and scientific and cultural qualities .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
To raise the ideological and ethical standards and scientific and cultural levels of the workers , peasants , intellectuals , and other laboring people and the entire population and improve their work skills and creativity and give full scope to their enthusiasm , initiative , and creative power - - these should remain the tasks of primary importance that our party should perform in representing China 's advanced productive forces .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .

Not only behavior criteria and ethical standards for leading cadres need to be adapted to socialist market economic rules and in line with the requirements of the times and with innovative spirit , they must also adhere to socialist value concept , avoid the negative impact of the market economy , and resist against such decadent thinking as mammonism , hedonism , and extreme individualism .  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
promote scientific , civil , progressive ideas and ways of production and living .  We must continue to bring the nation to a higher ideological , ethical , scientific , educational , and cultural level .  We must be disseminators of advanced Chinese culture .  
Yan Haiwang stressed that to intensify the ideological and political work , it is imperative to strengthen the leadership , so the leading bodies at all levels must persist in " stressing theoretical study , stressing political awareness , and stressing ethical conduct , " place the ideological and political work in an important position , establish and amplify the ideological and political work responsibility system , make regular study , step up examination , and earnestly " do two types of work simultaneously and attach equal importance to both . "  
You have demonstrated a spirit of patriotism , collectivism and socialism and kept to the virtues of sportsmanship .  You have won a double harvest in sports and in the advance of cultural and ethical progress by persisting in fair competition and giving your best shot .  
We must fully understand the great guiding significance of the important " three represents " thinking to promoting good party style and ethical integrity and to deepening the anti-corruption struggle .  We must work according to the " three represents " requirements , conceive , plan and do the work of combating corruption and encouraging ethical integrity by even higher standards , further raise the level of our ideological understanding and work guidance , constantly further the work of promoting good party style and ethical integrity , and score even greater success in it .  
it must make efforts to combine the theoretical nature of propaganda and education in ideals , beliefs , and ethical concepts with the practical nature of people 's daily life and work , and succeed in carrying out this work in a variety of forms , in a lively and vivid way that the masses enjoy and accept , which can answer problems of ideological understanding existing among the masses and continually play a tremendous role as a spiritual pillar in the masses ' work and endeavors .  
Every leading cadre should correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state , the collective , and the individual , pass the tests placed on them by their dependants and offspring , cultivate a noble and upright spirit , maintain an honest style of work , avoid being led astray by material or affections , build a strong ideological and ethical defense line , and enhance their capacity to reject corruption and prevent degeneracy .

"  
Second , it is necessary to link such activities with the promotion of spiritual civilization in rural areas , to heighten in an all-round way the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the masses of cadres and people in rural areas , and to provide economic and social development in rural areas with an ideological guarantee , spiritual motive force , and intellectual support .  
The subjects covered by previous speakers include a wide range of medical , social , political , international , ethical and educational issues .  
The Bill provides for the membership of the Council to be drawn from a wide cross-section of the community , including medical practitioners , social workers , lawyers and persons who are associated with religion .

Pointing to the Republic of China 's attractive investment climate , Chen Fei-lung , chairman of Nan Chao Chemical Industries commented , " Over the last 30 years , Taiwan has had a very stable and secure government . There is a highly skilled and educated work force , and with the traditional cultural and ethical background , this makes for harmonious labor relations . Worker productivity also surpasses that in many Southeast Asian nations . These are all factors that attract Overseas Chinese investment . "  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
The motive force behind progress is the pursuit of wealth . But even if people are well off , if they lack viable moral standards , then unrest and criminal behavior may arise . So we must set up a stable , ethical , harmonious society in which wealth is evenly distributed .  
Architects and scholars generally agree that traditional architecture had three special characteristics . First , from a structural perspective , the brackets piled layer by layer to support the eaves and the graceful sweep of the roof created a sense of fullness and lightness . Second , the strict attention paid to etiquette and the comprehensive ethical system of traditional society engendered a respect for balance and uprightness . Third , from a spiritual standpoint , the ancient Chinese cosmic order of yin and yang helped produce a feeling for the use of space .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
The problem is that we label aboriginal traditions as " ecologically wise " based on modern concepts of resource management developed in the industrialized world . But aboriginal culture is not some theory , but a practical way of life . It is a community culture produced through countless generations coexisting with nature , and includes a full complement of religious , ethical and social beliefs and values .  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
In great universities , all the various ideas co-exist : the philosophic schools of materialism and idealism , the aesthetic schools of realism and romanticism , the economic schools of mercantilism and laissez-faire , the ethical schools of moral purpose and utilitarianism , and the cosmological schools of optimism and negativism . That is why universities are ' universal , ' " declared Tsai .  
They opposed cliched formalism in writing , and advocated the use of the modern vernacular instead of the previously dominant classical Chinese . They decried China 's " cannibalistic " feudal ethical code and Confucianism , and demanded women 's rights , the liberation of the individual from the family and so on .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
The impact of high technology goes deeper than that of the old crafts , or even of traditional industries such as textiles , papermaking , or iron and steel . Like them , high-tech industries create pollution , and treat nature no differently from lifeless raw materials . But the unpredictable stream of innovations thrown up by modern science has also created many new ethical issues .  
Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients . Lin was frustrated and bewildered by this decision , because all she had wanted to do was to help reduce the dangers to which medical personnel were exposed .  
In this process , it was crucial to go beyond the limits of a technical exercise and to develop a process marked by shared ethical values where individual goals must be reconciled with global solidarity .  
The traditional concept of security , focused primarily on the security of States and based mainly on military components , should be replaced by a broader concept that includes social , economic , environmental , cultural , religious and ethical aspects .

Nevertheless , the systematic abuse of human rights which tactical allies were allowed to engage in , and which also characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of influence , reduced the ethical quality of the world inherited after the ending of the cold war .  
Not so much economic or political as ethical in nature , this crisis has weakened our institutions and undermined our financial system , the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our gross national product and has attracted the not-always-understanding attention of international opinion . 
The generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a perceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew with more vigour than ever its commitment to society , guided always by its convictions and never by considerations of convenience , respecting human rights and struggling with all its force for the perennial principles of justice , freedom and equality for all .

Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge .

Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients .
