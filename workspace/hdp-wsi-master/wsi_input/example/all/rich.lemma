What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another .

Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .

On several occasions , Comrade Jiang Zemin has also exhorted the whole party that party cadres , especially leading and senior cadres , should pass on their fine thinking , moral character , and personnel experiences in working hard for the party and people to their children and should strive to train the latter into people with a noble ethos and rich knowledge and that they should not take advantage of their positions and powers to seek illegitimate gain for their children .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .

The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .

The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .

The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .

focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .

The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .

The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
The broad ranks of veteran comrades have realized that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech delivered on 1 July contains rich contents and shows great foresight .

This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Taiwan is situated on the border of two of the major regions into which entomologists divide the world , and its insects combine the special characteristics of both . In addition , the island was formed in geological isolation and evolved a number of unique in digenous species . Its butterfly specimens , as a result , are extremely rich and varied .  
At the same time , the government should also thoroughly implement ecological protection and prevention of public hazards , while improving traffic , public safety , and living environment conditions . In this way the people will not only have access to plentiful resources for their everyday life , but will also enjoy a rich and meaningful spiritual life , thus thoroughly realizing the ideals of prosperity and equitable distribution of wealth as prescribed in our Principle of the People 's Well-Being .  
For many Taiwan businessmen , these conditions are lax and lenient , not to mention such advantageous factors as the countries ' spacious living environment , their rich natural resources , temperate climate and relative proximity to Taiwan . According to a survey by the Institute of Ethnology at Academia Sinica , Australia now stands even with the United States as the most alluring land of milk and honey for potential emigrants from Taiwan , and New Zealand ranks number five .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
This is because economic prosperity brought by industrial prosperity has led to luxuriant lives and long-term extravagant consumption of foods which are too rich and have too high a fat content , leading to overburdening the body 's organs , generating in turn obesity , high blood pressure , and diabetes .  
His style of performing , which Ming Li-kuo has described as " vigorous and vital like that of the Bunun , " was indeed explosive , and the rich , full sound of his violin , with his rapid , practiced bow work and dexterous fingering , earned audience ovations .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
As long as 120 years ago , just after it was founded , it treated applicants of all backgrounds just the same - - whether black or white , rich or poor , male or female . It is a citadel of academia that lives up to the ideal of " education without discrimination , " in the words of Confucius .

The Chang 's , for instance , who were the first to become foster parents , have become an " instructional boot camp " - - and not just for new foster parents .

"  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back .

"  
One of the features of tea is that it can be made stronger or weaker . It has its own striking flavor when strong ; when it is weak , it is more like water , suitable for mixing with various flavorings like jasmine , lemon , pomegranate , or whatever . This special feature combining rich flavors with diverse selection is just the thing for the youthful desire for constant change and novelty .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
It is called " Warm and lustrous , with a vibration heard far away , breakable but not bent , with a sharpness that does not hurt , like a fine gentleman . " It is endowed with rich connotations and emotions .  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
The banks and shoals of the Tsengwen estuary , built up by the accretion of silt over thousands of years , are rich in organic matter and bottomdwelling organisms , and the estuary 's broad intertidal zone , with large-scale aquaculture nearby , provides a safe environment with abundant food , which attracts enormous numbers of migratory birds to rest or over winter here .  
He believes that one of the main reasons why Taiwan fell into the hands of foreign rulers for half a century of its modern history was that the island 's rich mineral deposits had aroused the greed of other nations .  
Waking from a dream of riches only to be executed , you feel that life is short / Life and death are fated , neither rich nor poor can escape / The seasons change , the sun sets in the west and the water still flows / Where is the general 's horse today , the field is covered with flowers and grass / Life is a lonely boat , day and night the water flows upward / The boat is smashed and repaired / Death brings respite from the affairs of the world .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
Han Chinese migrants to Taiwan who tried these mats were all enthusiastic about them , so many women started making them . The addition of hand-woven patterns started a real fashion for the mats , making them a much-sought-after commodity , and high officials and rich folk going to the capital also looked on " dragon and phoenix mats " as ideal gifts to present to superiors . The rushes began to be specially cultivated instead of just being cut from the wild .  
Traditional looms , colorful aboriginal clothing , utensils woven from straw and bamboo , Tachia rushwork materials and products , batik made by mainland Chinese minority peoples , modern woven craft products showing rich creativity in materials and design . . . - - if you look closely at the exhibits in the Craft Center , you can discover how rich and how close to everyday life the world of weaving is .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
People are eager to collect its fearsome lower jaw , and in the USA a great white shark 's jaw can fetch up to US $ 5000 . Such rich rewards are naturally a powerful inducement , and to go shooting great white sharks has become a favorite pastime for Western divers . They also target other shark species , and the skeletons can be seen on sale in gift shops .  
Twelve years ago the first book in the ROC to promote ecological conservation , We Only Have One Earth , was published . From that time until today , a rich selection of publications focusing on the natural environment has been produced in Taiwan , following the progressive development of environmental consciousness here . Recently a publishing house has even been established specializing in books about nature .  
Entering into the museum as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary is like walking into a time tunnel of 7000 years . Through all these ancient eras , how many brave heroes , gifted gents and lovely ladies have come and gone ? Fortunately , we have a rich heritage of books , paintings and calligraphy , of objects that did not , like their owners , turn to ashes and dust . Instead they have become witnesses of the wisdom of the ancients , and a cultural inheritance .  
After looking at the splendor of the exquisite porcelain of the Song , Ming and Qing dynasties , we can then turn back to see the painted pottery and black basalt pottery of the neolithic age , the rich variety of the funerary objects of the Han dynasty , the green glaze pottery of the Wei and Jin , and the gorgeous Tang tricolor glaze . This will help us to better understand the course of development of Chinese ceramics .  
The broad realm of poetryAlthough poetry once again aimed to reach out to people and its language was no longer dark and obscure , it was still less accessible than novels or essays . Chang Shiang-hua states , " Its language is concise and to the point , rich in images . It expresses very well the sense of transience of the phenomena of human life . " At the same time , because schools offered no classes in appreciation of modern poetry , the general public still needed some guidance before it could really accept this work .  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
The country grew rich , and in 1938 the Labour government introduced the world 's most comprehensive social welfare system . New Zealanders , born with a silver spoon in their mouths , not only had their education , living expenses and health care paid for completely by the state , even their mothers looking after them could collect money from the government .  
Characterized by a blunt head and narrow chest , colored a rich , pure black tone , and with a slightly curved sickle-shaped dorsal fin , this creature reminds one of a mysterious and noble knight in armor .  
In the Tang dynasty , brothels were places where the rich and powerful met and mingled , and the entertainers were not only stunningly beautiful , but were also accomplished in every kind of artistic skill and social grace , including " poetry and calligraphy , conversation both serious and humorous , singing and dancing , playing musical instruments and appreciating tea . "  
Liang Chiungpai notes that not only do pickled veggies keep well for a long time , they come in many flavors , covering the gamut from sour and salty to sweet and hot ; they also help relieve that bloated feeling . Available to both rich and poor alike , and appropriate for both holidays and ordinary meals , these little appetizers are eminently suited to accompany fine cuisine .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
" It is really wonderful that such a rich , perfect thing can appear before all our eyes through the meticulous process of organizing , recording and production . And this clarity is not just a clarity of theory , but also an emotional clarity , between just this person and just this piece of music , here and now . Even in the present age , when tradition is in decline , a concerned person wo n't be lonely at all , but will rejoice at his or her own personal good fortune . "  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art . ' Members of the British middle class who failed at home , they came to Hong Kong determined to either get rich or go bust . "  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
In the late Ming dynasty , it is said that the salt merchants of Yangzhou graced their great halls with mechanical nudes . The export porcelain of Guangzhou is adorned with grossly distorted depictions of the crucifixion and naked missionaries chasing peasant girls . Who knows , then , what clever tricks Chambers ' rich business acquaintances in Guangzhou might have wanted to show off when trying to impress the Westerner ?  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Looking from another angle , after the Communist Party of China had won power , if they had governed well , developed China , fulfilled the calls to " overtake the US and Britain , " and improved the living conditions of the people , then even if Zhang had acted traitorously , even though his actions were morally flawed , the result of these actions would have been that China became rich and strong and he would still be a national hero to be revered through the ages . However , this has not been the reality .  
The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
In restaurants in Tungkang , center of Taiwan 's tuna industry , the eyes of the big-eyed tuna , formerly discarded as useless , are now deemed big attractions . These eyes , each nearly 10 cm in diameter , cooked up with some sour cabbage , are promoted by restaurant owners as being rich in DHA , which they say " makes your head healthy and strong ! "  
Banded coral shrimp , known in the Far East as " cherry blossom shrimp " for their bright pink color , breed only in Japan 's Surugawan Bay and in the sea off Tungkang , Taiwan . Because the Japanese regard these shrimp , which are rich in calcium and phosphorus , as a natural national treasure , the Taiwanese have started to catch them as well .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
To a Chinese , all these things seem vaguely familiar , yet also bizarre and alien . Today , as the world grows ever smaller , the Chinese style expressed overseas still has an element of the romance of a declining empire . But the appearance of today 's Chinese palaces is no longer so phantasmagorical , and they are no longer reserved for the sole enjoyment of royalty and rich folk .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers ( as used in Chinese knotting ) along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland . As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year . She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Taiwan , sitting at the intersection of the world 's largest continent with the world 's largest ocean , as an island with numerous mountains , has climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the temperate . An island rich in resources , Taiwan has been called " a microcosm of the northern hemisphere . "  
In taxonomic terms , life on Earth was no longer limited to the animal and plant kingdoms , but new kingdoms-fungi , bacteria , and protoctista ( protozoa , algae etc . ) - had to be recognized , to bring the total number to five . Each of the kingdoms of micro-organisms is just as gigantic , rich and complex as the plant and animal kingdoms .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Residents , on the other hand , want a casino . But , casino or no , Hsiao Liuchiu is already rich in natural assets . It is a coral island surrounded by azure seas and possessed of sparkling beaches , all of which are potential tourist attractions .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
It was quite a story at the time . This 16-year-old Brazilian youth had already , at the age of 14 , won first prize on a Brazilian television quiz show , startling everybody with his rich knowledge of China . As a result , the ROC ambassador to Brazil , T.T . Li , noticed him , and eventually he was invited to visit the ROC by then-minister of education Chang Chi-yun and vice foreign minister Shen Chuang-huan . This event planted the seeds of a lifelong love for Chinese culture and for Taiwan .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
Of all the famous artifacts it was the carved ivory balls in particular that captured his interest . The superb craftsmanship expressed in their warm rich hues and intricately carved multiple layers never ceased to amaze him . Seeing these ivory balls he too was determined to carve ivory once he had completed his obligatory military service .  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Although Peter Lai 's methods for gaining his mastery of the English language may appear diverse and unusual , they are based on a simple and unchanging principle . Today 's society is a treasure-house full of rich resources for the study of English . It is there on radio and television and in magazines , but a student needs the conviction , courage and patience to work hard and take full advantage of these resources in order to succeed .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have . There was no starch , no sweet and hot sauce , no cabbage , just a simple platter of oysters and eggs , but still it tasted great . It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
The writer Chen Fang-ming lauds The Butterfly Trail for " saying a great deal by examining the small . " According to Chen , Wu 's meticulous and profound exploration of the world of butterflies draws on encyclopedic knowledge and the most authoritative texts . As it shuttles back and forth , Wu 's narrative is always illuminating , and enables his readers to accompany him as he discovers natural history and experiences a rich and strange universe .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
The Asia Pacific region is densely populated , is rich in natural resources , and has rapid economic development At the same time , the area is susceptible to natural disasters due to its complex geological structure and abrupt geological movement It is hit frequently by volcanic eruptions , oceanic forces , and earthquakes  
Li said that China holds that all nations , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal members of the international community China is ready to increase friendly cooperation with Estonia in every area , economic and trade areas in particular  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added  
yongnian county is located in the center of the north china plain , with rich land and convenient transportation farmers living here have the tradition of planting vegetables at present the county 's vegetable planting area is nearly 9,000 ha , with an annual production volume of about 400-million kg  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all countries , no matter they are big or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , should be on an equal footing  
local press reporsts today quoted officials of the oau as saying that the conference was aimed at bringing to the notice of rich nations outside the continent , the severe hardship being experienced by african nations due to harsh conditions attached to loans from some creditor nations and organizations  
It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Unfortunately , international economic relations are still marked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growing gap between rich and poor countries .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
We hold that serious thought must be given to devising a suitable arrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our global community in its rich diversity and that is amenable to periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes in a dynamic world .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
National approaches to managing cultural diversity which nurtured the rich culture and linguistic traditions inherent in diverse communities would enhance the competitive position of national economies and increase international peace and security .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
We commit ourselves to attaining the goals of universal and equitable access to quality education and to basic health services , without distinction by race , national origin , gender or age , and to preserving and promoting our rich and varied cultural heritage , as indispensable bases for people-centred sustainable development . 
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
As we all know , Antarctica is a unique ecosystem endowed with rich mineral resources , ideal conditions for scientific research , 90 per cent of the world 's fresh water resources and rare species of flora and fauna . 
The rich debate on the results achieved in dealing with the substantive issues on the agenda of the Congress confirmed the leading role of the congresses in the promotion of more effective crime prevention and criminal justice policies and strategies by recommending action at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Copenhagen Programme of Action provides a rich source of ideas and practical suggestions that might constitute elements of effective national strategies that would command the required political support at national level , in full recognition of both the diversity of country situations and the need for coherent , organized efforts , with a clear purpose . 
A mass of detailed research in recent years has revealed a rich fabric of support networks and mutual or community-based initiatives to deal with everyday problems of economic survival and social functioning .  
In other words , accepting this as the sole parameter would be tantamount to recognizing the domination of the Security Council by a small group of rich and mighty countries and would be contrary to the profound aspiration of the international community to establishing a system of collective security in which a reformed , modernized and more democratic Security Council would fully take into account , with efficiency and transparency , the preoccupations and needs of all States , regardless of their size , level of development or economic conditions .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
The rich diversity of nations ' historical , cultural , religious , social and economic backgrounds must be respected and their different priorities recognized .  
At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .

The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
The working methods and procedures which are ordinarily used in the Conference as instruments for decision _ making were devised to serve the old order ; in the years to come , the challenge will be not only to adjust our strategic thinking to the demise of the East _ West dialectic but to come to grips with a security agenda which is more diverse , rich and complex , both in geopolitical and in functional terms .  
The new technologies may be destroying more jobs than they create ; there is a great risk that they will in fact widen the gap between rich and poor ; and the huge capital investments required to strengthen national capabilities to produce and use ICTs may divert both public and private resources from other activities which could have greater development impact .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
Moreover , societies that are increasingly divided into two blocs , the rich and the poor , could not fully enjoy the benefits of their accomplishments because they will constantly be threatened by social strife and internal turmoil , a situation not conducive to the promotion and observance of human rights .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
It is about creating an enabling government and an enabling environment in which the ordinary person the impoverished , the disillusioned , the educated and the rich feels included and feels that he or she can participate in the decision-making process and feels that his or her dreams can be truly realized .  
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
I am convinced that your rich and profound experience in diplomatic relations , together with your personal qualities , will facilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly session and make it an outstanding international event .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
While our strong commitment to social policy has paid rich dividends , as illustrated by the successive high rankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human development index , emerging problems largely associated with poverty , particularly among youth , are of critical concern .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
It is also understood that global sustainability will remain mere wishful thinking so long as the rich industrialized countries continue to undermine the ecological life-support system of the human family by wasting resources .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Considering that the dedication of a year to the act of giving thanks gives us the opportunity to remember the fundamental importance of cultural diversity in the development of a rich and harmonious International life and that one of the purposes of the United Nations , as expressed in its Charter , is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems in economic , social , cultural and humanitarian areas without creating any distinctions for reasons of race , sex , language or religion ,

Consistently and methodically Turkey continues its unabated policy of altering the demographic character of occupied Cyprus through destruction , looting and pillaging of its copious archaeological and religious treasures , which form an integral part of the rich patrimony of the world .  
Some consider that the permanent nature of the organization is the source of unacceptable waste at a time when budgetary austerity is being imposed on all countries and at a stage in our economic history which is haunted by the spectre of crisis and unemployment among both poor and rich .  
The international priority agenda on forests should be holistic , comprehensive and inclusive of the areas of priority concerns of both countries with rich and countries with scarce forest resources , and should contain at least the basic elements agreed at the Forums third session .  
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs . 
An important and recent concern has been the impact of transnational informational technology and mass media on peoples perceptions and expectations , in terms of their leading to or aggravating a conflict between expectations and realities , and between values and social roles , induced by the contrast between the cultures of rich countries and the pattern of opportunity in less well off societies .  
It was disturbing that the gap between the poor and the rich in the world was increasing while official development assistance ( ODA ) measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the developed countries had just reached its lowest level in 50 years .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .

We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
The propaganda and ideological front must center closely on the theme of celebrations defined by the central authorities ; firmly grasp the correction orientation ; loudly chorus the main theme of the Communist Party , socialism , and the drive of reform and opening up being good ; vigorously create a rich and dense atmosphere of loving the party , loving the motherland , and loving socialism ;  
However , the United States now tries to hold " across-the-board superiority " and guarantees its " absolute security " on the basis of the swelling hegemonic mentality supported by its unparalleled power after the end of the Cold War and the rich financial resources accumulated by the sustained economic growth in recent years .  
The northwest region of Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang has a vast territory , a large number of high scientific and technological personnel , and economic characteristics , and the combination of Hong Kong 's funds with the achievements in high science and technology in these areas will turn out to be a big fortune .  What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .  
To put it another way , we believe that like the natural world , the world of mankind is rich and colorful in nature , and the layout of world political and economic systems and order [ based on ] legal principles of international relations must fit and promote the realization of this diversity .  
Nevertheless , development in the world is still unbalanced , and even inharmonious , and is still faced with quite a few complicated issues , and the world still has a long way to go before the goal of democratizing international relations is attained , for we have not yet fundamentally changed the unfair and unreasonable political and economic order in the world ; the " digital gap " between the rich and the poor , and between the south and the north is still widening ; and local conflicts are still breaking out one after another . 
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Li Peng said : China pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy and holds that all countries in the world , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal in international affairs .  All countries have the right to select their own social systems and development courses on the basis of their own national conditions .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
On several occasions , Comrade Jiang Zemin has also exhorted the whole party that party cadres , especially leading and senior cadres , should pass on their fine thinking , moral character , and personnel experiences in working hard for the party and people to their children and should strive to train the latter into people with a noble ethos and rich knowledge and that they should not take advantage of their positions and powers to seek illegitimate gain for their children .  
Thus it is very natural for the Chinese people bullied and humiliated by superpowers from Western countries and domestic reactionary forces over the past 100-plus years ? to look forward to the socialist ideal - expect their country to be prosperous , rich and strong , but without the phenomena of a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the weak being bullied by the strong .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .  No doubt that the middle - and lower-class have been displeased , many people of the upper class , including such moderate of the Republican Party as Jeffords , also have been complaining quite a lot .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
In a recent speech at a forum in Zhejiang , entitled " New and High Technology , and Risk Investment , " the renowned economist Wu Jinglian said : With the evaporation of bubbles of the Nasdaq , which represents US high-tech shares , there has been an upsurge of Chinese students returning home from their high and new technology jobs in the United States . As Zhejiang has the features of rich private capital and flexible enterprise mechanisms , the wave of returned Chinese students from abroad will bring new opportunities to Zhejiang 's economic development .  
The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
Capitalism has developed over 300 years , accumulated rich experience , developed a solid material basis , and established relatively mature economic and legal systems .  
focus our attention on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics to meet the increasing demands of the people ; and direct the people to get mentally equipped and upgraded with correct ideas .  
The party 's policy to get the population rich must be adhered to .  On the basis of economic growth , efforts should be made to increase income for urban and rural residents , constantly improve their living conditions , including food , clothing , housing , transport and daily necessities , improve the social security system , and medical and health facilities , with a view to bettering their life .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
The democratization of international relations is far from being realized , the unjust and unfair world political and economic order remains unchanged , the gaps between the South and the North in development levels and between the rich and the poor are widening , and conflicts caused by racial , religious , and other issues are continuing .  
11 .  The two sides reiterate that all countries - - be they large or small , strong or weak , poor or rich - - have the right to decide their own fates , have the right to choose their political , economic , and social development courses in accordance with their national conditions , and have an equal right in participating in the discussion and settlement of world affairs .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
The broad ranks of veteran comrades have realized that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech delivered on 1 July contains rich contents and shows great foresight .  Besides systematically summing up our party 's 80-year basic experience and glorious course , the speech comprehensively expounded the important thinking of the " three represents " and further pointed out the historic task and fighting objective of the party in the new century .  
According to the uniform view expressed , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , grasped the overall situation , was based on an elevated perspective , and comprehensively reviewed and systematically summed up the party 's splendid history and basic experience of 80 years , thereby constituting a programmatic Marxist document rich in theoretical innovation , educating and encouraging the people , and urging the people forward .  
They should establish their footing on the current situation of the country , advance with the time , break new grounds , pay attention primarily to studying the important issues in real life , draw the rich resources and strong power for their theoretical innovation from reforms , opening up and modernization drive , closely follow the trend of world development , and profoundly understand the laws for contemporary China 's economic and social development .  
In the 80 years since its founding , the CPC has grown from a small and weak force to a big and strong one .  It has defeated formidable enemies in extremely difficult conditions and kept forging ahead in a tortuous course of exploration , accumulating very rich experiences .  
He was very happy to learn that a large number of peasants had extricated themselves from poverty and become rich through growing Chinese medicinal herbs and promoting special livestock breeding .  Hu Jintao said : Yanbian is richly endowed by nature and enjoys good prospects in developing industries along specialized lines .  
It is of typical significance , unique value , and rich historical connotation in correctly approaching the historical missions of Marxism to scientifically analyze our party 's strenuous explorations over the last 80 years and the profound scientific connotations of the important thinking of " three represents . "  
Li Rongrong , the chair of this meeting and Chairman of China 's Economic and Trade Commission , said that the meeting with its rich content and packed program produced fruitful results and completed all set agendas without a hitch .

Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
As everyone knows , Xinjiang has rich water , land , solar energy , thermal power , mineral , and tourist resources .  With distinctive features and good conditions for combination of such resources , Xinjiang has giant potential and vast prospects for development .  
The rich human resources , high proportion of young and middle-aged population , notable cost advantages , and the state 's measures to lighten the burdens of state-owned enterprises , divert surplus personnel to other jobs , and separate the functions of running social undertakings are all conducive to heightening labor productivity .

Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
The impacts of an economic globalization have proved a major factor that leads to the increasingly widening chasm between the rich and the poor in the United States ; and while new industries , such as the industry of information technology , are reaping in exorbitant profits , the traditional industries of the West , such as the textile industry , are shrinking rapidly .  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .

Countries , large or small , rich or poor , and strong or weak , all have their equal right to actively participate in international economic organizations and join the common effort to formulate various rules of the game governing " liberalization " in all areas , in an endeavor to establish a fair and just new global economic order in the 21st century .  
Recently , to attain excessive profits , foreign organizers for illegal emigration continually manipulated the masses ' eagerness to get rich , changed their tactics , and plotted and organized illegal emigration .

It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The pictorial , in vivid visual form and simple language , provides graphic and rich materials for party members to fully understand and grasp the essence of the " three represents " theory .  It is a teaching aid for grass-roots party organizations to step up and improve party ideological and political work .  
Regarding the issue of economic globalization , Chairman Li Peng emphasized that the economic globalization has brought about new opportunities of economic development for all countries in the world .  Nevertheless , as the disparity between the rich and the poor in the world has been widening and the contradictions between the South and the North have become more outstanding , those developing countries which are in a weak position are confronting bigger risks and challenges .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .

They require as the basis for their generation scientific theoretical understanding , and protracted influence by rich practical experience and environment , and they can certainly not be generated by simply relying on preaching or external coercion .

The Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department jointly held in Beijing today a report meeting on the educational activities of " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich . "  The meeting reviewed and exchanged the experience gained in conducting the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage , analyzed and studied their developments , and made specific plans and arrangements for the next stage of " double thinking " educational work .  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
After taking office , Putin laid down a national development strategy designed to " make the country strong and people rich " and tentatively worked out an intermediate - and long-term economic development plan .

Generally , developing countries possess vast land , have huge populations , are rich in natural resources , and have vast markets .  Without progress in developing countries , it will be difficult for developed countries to maintain lasting prosperity .  
The unjust and irrational old international economic order is a major cause that creates a wide gap between rich and poor .  
We also clearly realize that China is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , its economic foundation is weak , and its regional development is uneven .  For China to become strong and rich , long and unremitting efforts are still needed .  
The existing industrial foundations , technological capabilities , rich natural resources , and superiority in labor resources in the central and western regions will provide favorable conditions for foreign businesses to participate in the cooperative development of China 's central and western regions .

Factors still exist that threaten peace and hamper development , however , and the current unfairness and irrationalities in the present international order do harm to the independence , sovereignty , and security of the developing countries , while disparities between south and north and poor and rich have further expanded .

Hubei has outstanding natural conditions and rich resources .  It is nationally renowned for its scientific and educational undertakings .  With its solid industrial and agricultural foundation , it has the potential for rapid development .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .

When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .

The " record , " citing the US election campaign and other detailed examples , lays bare the myth of American " democracy " and completely brings to light its escalating violence , unfair judicature , the widening gap between the rich and the poor , worrying economic and social rights of workers , serious gender discrimination , children being in a grim situation , unchanged racial discrimination , bad benefits for minorities , exhausting all resources for military buildup , and brutal infringements on other countries ' human rights .  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
The western region is rich in coal , oil , natural gas and other resources and has tremendous potential for development .  If efforts are made to improve the transportation , telecommunications , water conservation , and other areas of the infrastructure in the western region , the strong points of the region will be brought into play and this will lay a solid foundation for its long-term development .

The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .  
We should persist in taking accelerated development as the main theme , bring into full play our advantages , such as good location , scientific and educational strengths , and rich natural resources , and , on the basis of the sound development scored in the Ninth Five-Year Plan , strive to increase our overall strength , narrow our gap with east China , quickly raise the people 's income , and ease the employment pressure .  
" With a sparse population , Tibet is rich in resources , the central authorities implement many preferential policies toward the region , and various parts of the country vigorously provide support for it ; In addition , it has late-coming advantages .  By carrying out the strategy of bringing about great-leap-forward development , we are confident in making Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's wish come true that Tibet will advance in the front ranks of China 's modernization drive by the middle of the 21st century .

The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
In restaurants in Tungkang , center of Taiwan 's tuna industry , the eyes of the big-eyed tuna , formerly discarded as useless , are now deemed big attractions . These eyes , each nearly 10 cm in diameter , cooked up with some sour cabbage , are promoted by restaurant owners as being rich in DHA , which they say " makes your head healthy and strong ! "  
Banded coral shrimp , known in the Far East as " cherry blossom shrimp " for their bright pink color , breed only in Japan 's Surugawan Bay and in the sea off Tungkang , Taiwan . Because the Japanese regard these shrimp , which are rich in calcium and phosphorus , as a natural national treasure , the Taiwanese have started to catch them as well .  
Although the political center of China in ancient times was in cities far from the sea such as Chang'an ( modern Xi'an ) and Luoyang , those who lived close to rivers ate food from the rivers , and those who lived close to lakes ate food from the lakes . The Yellow River basin-the cradle of Chinese culture-provided a rich harvest of freshwater fish and crustaceans , and thus gave birth to Chinese people 's taste for eating all kinds of aquatic produce fresh from the " three rivers , four seas and five lakes . "  
It is true that Beijing is some way from the ocean , but having been an imperial capital for many centuries , in Wu Weiye 's day it had no lack of fine foods from mountain and sea . If he had only been a little more adventurous : there were no fresh oysters or clams , but as gastronome Tang Lu-sun reminds us , outside Qianmen Gate merchants sold rich , plump , fresh crabs of such exquisite flavor that even Emperor Qianlong was apt to slip out of the Forbidden City in disguise to sample them .  
It was said that the plan was simply an effort to bail out the construction industry , and was not in the public interest . Reasons for this view included the huge amount of money involved , and the fact that the were no provisions to stop the rich or those who already owned homes from taking advantage of the special mortgage rate . In fact , anyone who wants to purchase a new home from a construction company is eligible for a low-interest mortgage to buy one .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
As a result of this dramatic flux there was a wholesale and merciless reshuffling of national wealth , which widened the gap between rich and poor , made it impossible for most people to afford their own homes and severely penalized those who had blindly invested in the stockmarket . These factors , along with ballooning consumer prices and a general sense of restless anxiety , seriously undermined the traditional work ethics of practicality and diligence .  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
On the other hand , Mu Huai-ling of VGH points out that even when one does go in for a rich feast at the New Year , it is better to eat fish than meat , better to eat lean meat than streaky pork complete with its rind and fat , and better to eat sea cucumber than cholesterol-rich mullet roe or crab eggs ; in short , you ca n't go wrong by cutting down on meat and eating plenty of vegetables , fruit and whole grains .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
To a Chinese , all these things seem vaguely familiar , yet also bizarre and alien . Today , as the world grows ever smaller , the Chinese style expressed overseas still has an element of the romance of a declining empire . But the appearance of today 's Chinese palaces is no longer so phantasmagorical , and they are no longer reserved for the sole enjoyment of royalty and rich folk .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers ( as used in Chinese knotting ) along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland . As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year . She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .  
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation . But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .  
Taiwan , sitting at the intersection of the world 's largest continent with the world 's largest ocean , as an island with numerous mountains , has climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the temperate . An island rich in resources , Taiwan has been called " a microcosm of the northern hemisphere . "  
In taxonomic terms , life on Earth was no longer limited to the animal and plant kingdoms , but new kingdoms-fungi , bacteria , and protoctista ( protozoa , algae etc . ) - had to be recognized , to bring the total number to five . Each of the kingdoms of micro-organisms is just as gigantic , rich and complex as the plant and animal kingdoms .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Residents , on the other hand , want a casino . But , casino or no , Hsiao Liuchiu is already rich in natural assets . It is a coral island surrounded by azure seas and possessed of sparkling beaches , all of which are potential tourist attractions .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
The team she leads took the theme of " family reunion at Mid-Autumn Festival " as the basis to ingeniously integrate content from earth science ( the movement of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon ) , maths ( quadratic functions of Hou Yi shooting down the nine suns ) , history ( mid-autumn legends and the Mongol Empire ) , and counseling activities ( satisfactions and regrets in life ) , which they linked together in a set of thematic activities with a rich content .  
It was quite a story at the time . This 16-year-old Brazilian youth had already , at the age of 14 , won first prize on a Brazilian television quiz show , startling everybody with his rich knowledge of China . As a result , the ROC ambassador to Brazil , T.T . Li , noticed him , and eventually he was invited to visit the ROC by then-minister of education Chang Chi-yun and vice foreign minister Shen Chuang-huan . This event planted the seeds of a lifelong love for Chinese culture and for Taiwan .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .  
And Taiwan has a special history , she explains . It has experienced colonization and imperialism and is a cosmopolitan place with strong ties to the rest of the world , but it also has the rich cultures of the Southern-Fujianese-speaking " Taiwanese , " the Mandarin-speaking mainlanders who arrived after the war , and its aboriginal tribes . " How can it not have abundant stories , emotions , conflicts , dreams and all the sweet , sour , bitter and hot that make up people 's lives ? "  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
In a society where " information equals power , " it is apparent that the gulfs between urban and rural , rich and poor will be increasingly difficult to traverse . Disparities in digital technology accordingly will become one of the world 's most controversial issues .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .  
We witnessed how homeless people at Lungshan Temple died of cold when cold fronts swept through at Western New Year 's . The next day , the news was flooded with stories of celebrities and the details of their elegant New Year apparel ; even as frigid corpses lay in the street , the consumerist priorities of the global economy held sway , and only the goings-on of the rich were on people 's lips .  
Of all the famous artifacts it was the carved ivory balls in particular that captured his interest . The superb craftsmanship expressed in their warm rich hues and intricately carved multiple layers never ceased to amaze him . Seeing these ivory balls he too was determined to carve ivory once he had completed his obligatory military service .  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Although Peter Lai 's methods for gaining his mastery of the English language may appear diverse and unusual , they are based on a simple and unchanging principle . Today 's society is a treasure-house full of rich resources for the study of English . It is there on radio and television and in magazines , but a student needs the conviction , courage and patience to work hard and take full advantage of these resources in order to succeed .  
These books are regarded as books " by bad kids , for bad kids . " There are numerous young writers on the mainland now attempting to gain a name for themselves by following Han Han 's model . Han himself is rich and famous . Like Taiwan singing idol Lin Chih-ying , Han is fond of racing expensive cars .  
Given the growing gap between rich and poor in Taiwan , and the fact that more than 70% of the state 's tax revenue comes from deductions from salaries and wages , the tax contribution of the wealthy is so low that it constitutes a social injustice . This is why Shen Fu-hsiung emphasizes the need to levy an " assets tax " as soon as possible-especially a capital gains tax on profits from stock transactions . The latter has long been advocated by experts , but equally long avoided like the plague by legislators .  
Although the oysters on the white porcelain dish were small , they gave off a rich aroma that the fat chunky oysters in Taiwan just do n't have . There was no starch , no sweet and hot sauce , no cabbage , just a simple platter of oysters and eggs , but still it tasted great . It was only then that I realized why the early immigrants to Taiwan were so deeply attached to ou-a-jian .  
Another and most troubling phenomenon for researchers is that as a self-supporting economic unit caring for the elderly and looking after children , the number of economically disadvantaged families has increased in recent years , and the gap between rich and poor households has widened .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
The writer Chen Fang-ming lauds The Butterfly Trail for " saying a great deal by examining the small . " According to Chen , Wu 's meticulous and profound exploration of the world of butterflies draws on encyclopedic knowledge and the most authoritative texts . As it shuttles back and forth , Wu 's narrative is always illuminating , and enables his readers to accompany him as he discovers natural history and experiences a rich and strange universe .  
The " content " of these cultural products has been rich and varied but Taiwan , with its many downstream industries , has been short of something very important in the development of its culture industry-intermediaries who will make the connection to an artistic source , then apply technology so that art is transformed into a commodity of a different kind , and intangible culture can become a tangible industry .  
Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
The Asia Pacific region is densely populated , is rich in natural resources , and has rapid economic development At the same time , the area is susceptible to natural disasters due to its complex geological structure and abrupt geological movement It is hit frequently by volcanic eruptions , oceanic forces , and earthquakes  
Li said that China holds that all nations , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , are equal members of the international community China is ready to increase friendly cooperation with Estonia in every area , economic and trade areas in particular  
noting that russia is rich in natural and human resources , li said he believed that the russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties china wishes to see a stable russia with a growing economy , he added  
yongnian county is located in the center of the north china plain , with rich land and convenient transportation farmers living here have the tradition of planting vegetables at present the county 's vegetable planting area is nearly 9,000 ha , with an annual production volume of about 400-million kg  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
He reiterated that the Chinese government has always adopted an independent foreign policy for peace and held that all countries , no matter they are big or small , rich or poor , strong or weak , should be on an equal footing  
local press reporsts today quoted officials of the oau as saying that the conference was aimed at bringing to the notice of rich nations outside the continent , the severe hardship being experienced by african nations due to harsh conditions attached to loans from some creditor nations and organizations  
It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Unfortunately , international economic relations are still marked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growing gap between rich and poor countries .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
On the political and economic levels , the world continued to be divided into rich countries and poor countries , a polarization which seriously threatened human survival and the maintenance of security and peace .  
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
Natural resources restored , revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation must be managed by citizens , families and communities , who shall learn to acquire know-how , to share knowledge , to spread information , and to tap both the vast , exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
Perhaps this new humanitarian world order , because of its aims which would make the human being the main focus of international action in such areas as the eradication of poverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap between the rich and the poor , on both the individual and societal levels , may well furnish the solid foundation upon which we can build the desired new world order whose parameters have not crystallized as yet .  
We hold that serious thought must be given to devising a suitable arrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our global community in its rich diversity and that is amenable to periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes in a dynamic world .  
History is replete with instances of youth frustration militating against development and social progress in rich as well as poor countries when the existing political and social institutions were either unwilling or unable to respond meaningfully and in a timely manner to youth problems and aspirations . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
National approaches to managing cultural diversity which nurtured the rich culture and linguistic traditions inherent in diverse communities would enhance the competitive position of national economies and increase international peace and security .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : For the past 50 years , the First Committee has been the most important multilateral forum in areas related to international peace and security , a forum to which each and every one of the members of the international community be they rich or poor , weak or strong contributes with the overwhelming sense of being equal under the Charter .  
We commit ourselves to attaining the goals of universal and equitable access to quality education and to basic health services , without distinction by race , national origin , gender or age , and to preserving and promoting our rich and varied cultural heritage , as indispensable bases for people-centred sustainable development . 
In connection with article 6 , paragraph 5 , we are of the view that , in assuring the representation of the principal legal systems of the world , the representation of Islamic penal legislation as a comprehensive and independent system that is rich in human experience and is authoritative for a large number of countries should not be overlooked .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
an acceptable answer was to be found , factors such as rapid economic and political change , environmental degradation , deteriorating living standards , vast disparities between rich and poor , dismantling of social services , breakdown of traditional social support structures and rising violence , crime , intolerance and hatred must be taken into account . 
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
Therefore , it is incumbent upon the international community and in particular the developed countries , to give the required attention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucial equation , because it is impossible to accept , in the context of interdependence , a world in which affluence is concentrated in a small number of countries while the majority of countries continue to struggle against increasing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor grows inexorably wider .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
As we all know , Antarctica is a unique ecosystem endowed with rich mineral resources , ideal conditions for scientific research , 90 per cent of the world 's fresh water resources and rare species of flora and fauna .
