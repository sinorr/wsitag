She pays close attention to facial expression , physical structure , musculature , old clothing and hair styles , and even details such as eyebrows and eyelashes are painstakingly sculpted hair by hair .  
The most important physical characteristics of the Mongoloid race are flat noses , prominent cheekbones , rather prominent eye sockets , straight black hair , tawny skin and slanted , or almond-shaped , eyes . There are thirteen major and minor characteristics in all , which will be examined in more detail in another article .  
The Forest School should n't be special - - it 's just trying to put into practice ideals repeatedly stressed by Chinese and foreign educators . " No cramming ; no corporal punishment ; balanced education in ethics , knowledge , physical education , social skills , and arts ; allowing the children to become the lead actors in the study process " and other concepts all have their chance to be realized here .  
In order to encourage more people to become foundation participants by contributing at least NT $ 30,000 each , the clinic provides two physical examinations a year free of charge and has spruced itself up with a face lift . It looks reminiscent of a greenhouse with plants and greenery every where , and the nursing staff wear colorful patterned uniforms rather than white . "  
This situation , where the " supply " of transplant organs fails to meet " demand " , is one that concerned individuals from all walks of life have been doing their best to improve in Taiwan , aided by legislative backing . The law used to hold the position that clinical death only occurs once the respiratory and circulatory systems have ceased to function - - at which time the condition of physical organs begins to decline rapidly , limiting the possibilities for transplantation .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
Their coach , physical education professor Wu Teng-ta tells us : " The props for drum dancing are quite simple ; cymbals are all you need for backup accompaniment . Also the movements are lively and beautifully patterned , making this kind of dance perfect for high school and primary school students learning traditional folk dances . " The students of Taitung Normal College can take elective courses in drum dancing , so that some day they may pass along the art to their own students .  
A Moving Competition : Huang Chin-tsuan , who led the team to Japan , notes the vigor of Japan 's paralympic athletics program , with its organizations and centers spread out all over the country . Their volunteers are thickly distributed and knowledgeable . Huang says enviously , " Even more importantly , regular school phys-ed teachers are prepared with knowledge about the physical education needs of the handicapped , so that disabled students , under the appropriate care , can participate in phys-ed class . "  
He says that in South Africa there is a scientist who has studied black eagles for more than twenty years . The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
The Mu-Kuang Rehabilitation Center is now located in Tungshan Rural Township , Ilan County , on a 4300 m2 site . As well as professional instructors , audio-assisted braille teaching equipment and an all-round education and training program , the Center has a library , a massage teaching room , a scented garden for the blind , and so on . These comprehensive facilities are intended to cater to all the needs of the students from their education and physical well being to their preparation for later life .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
Then people would start yelling or crying or having other strong emotional reactions . When the physical problems appeared , Mesmer and his assistants would massage the afflicted part of the body to " prompt the magnetic fluid to pass through . " The results appeared to be quite good .  
He viewed his patient 's emotional and physical state sparked by painful past experiences as a kind of " unusual mental power . " Wang is the first to employ the powers of mental projection , determination and imagination as used by Eastern religious devotees to deal with these " negative energies . "  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology . The social science and humanities group , meanwhile , following an old tradition , continued to be dominated by economists .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
At the same time , new standardized physical fitness tests have been announced for all of Taiwan 's elementary schools and junior and senior high schools . So balanced education is no longer just a distant ideal . It has become a trend of the times .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
Today , people are too busy trying to maintain the minimum requirements for their physical existences to have that kind of relaxed , merry perspective on life . I 'm afraid few people indeed are able to address the real world with a " heart of frequent leisure . "  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
After returning from New York with his MFA degree and restarting the Kuang Huan Dance Circle , Liou drew upon his extensive practice of taijiquan , qigong and yoga , and made " qi , " " body " and " mind " the troupe 's new guiding principles-when free circulation of the qi ( breath or vital energy ) is achieved , a person becomes light and nimble , and develops a greater sensitivity toward nuances of space and time ; body refers the physical body , and mind to one 's thoughts , will and intentions .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
Although this is a new and ambitious research project and no one can tell if it will succeed or not , the chance to help numerous people improve their nutritional intake , physical condition and thus national educational levels and competitiveness , is well worth the effort .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries . Anticipating that in addition to the physical injuries , there would be some who would need to be treated for psychological shock , Hu Wei-herng , director of the Taipei City Psychiatric Center , worked together with a psychiatric team from Mackay Memorial Hospital to evaluate the emotional state of the victims .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
He explains that when a patient first comes into the hospital , he is examined by a psychiatrist who treats his acute symptoms , such as insomnia , anxiety or depression . After his symptoms have been moderated , a clinical psychologist evaluates the patient 's personality and his physical and mental condition . Based on this , the clinical psychologist then provides counseling . If the patient 's abilities have deteriorated , an occupational therapist designs a rehabilitation program , which might include planning some recreational activities or interpersonal relations training .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes . In addition to this physical suffering , before the introduction of universal health insurance in Taiwan kidney disease was a tremendous financial burden for patients ; now that dialysis is covered by National Health Insurance , it is a substantial item of the system 's expenditure .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
In taijiquan , much is made of the need to remain loose , soft , supple and still , and key elements in training include keeping the head erect , the shoulders loose , elbows down , wrists supple , hips loose and feet firmly planted on the ground . For dancers trained from an early age in the Western discipline , with its frequent calls for physical exertion and gravity-defying leaps , this is a total departure .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
Every traditional culture in the world has magic amulets ( geometric shapes , bones , insects or animals ) that bring good luck , ward off evil , or affect the physical or mental condition of other people , or that even , with the appropriate incantations , put you online to the supernatural world .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood . Perhaps , avers Li , the bacteria in the bodily fluids of the corpse reproduce by using the chicken blood as a nutrient . Someone drinking such a mix would probably get sick .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
For example , they categorized the Aborigines into groups based on criteria like mutual intelligibility of language , physical characteristics , social structure ( for example , the Puyuma and Amis had matriarchal societies , the Rukai and Paiwan had aristocratic classes ) , and religious beliefs ( e.g . ancestral worship , the belief in pygmy spirits ) . It was only at this point that the division of Taiwan 's Aboriginal peoples into nine tribes appeared .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
The result of the conflict between virus and immune system is a fever , cough and other immune reactions . Thus the disease begins to spread via airborne droplets and physical contact . This occurs when one comes into contact with the oral and / or nasal secretions of the patient or with infected fecal matter and then touches the lining of one 's own mouth , eyes or nose . There are no receptors on the skin itself , so becoming infected by skin contact is unlikely .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Loss events can be the loss of one 's health , such as a fatal disease , an intractable chronic illness , or physical disability ; the loss of a loved one , such as the death or departure of a close friend or relative ; the loss of one 's job or property ; or seeing one 's cherished hopes dashed , such as suddenly finding out that one 's spouse has a lover .  
The town charter , carved on a black tablet in front of the town hall , is less a set of regulations than a gentle reminder of the townsfolk 's common ideals , and the Shikatsu Historical and Folklore Museum , situated behind the town hall , could be considered a physical manifestation of these very ideals .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
In my youthful enthusiasm for that novel adventure I blithely forgot that I had always only barely made the grade in terms of physical fitness , and busily set about buying my first rucksack , my first pair of hiking boots , and a full set of warm outdoor clothes . In the biting cold of the seventh day of the lunar New Year , I excitedly set off on my first aeroplane flight , to Taichung where the group was to assemble .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
The chief executive of the LBMA said that the main cause of the increase in silver business was a high level of physical demand and increased activity in the forward market  
Activities that are dangerous or harmful to the child 's harmonious physical , mental and spiritual development or are liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child ;  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
Certain women who are subject to physical or sexual violence by their drugusing partners or parents may none the less feel responsible for caring for their families or may be without alternative means of livelihood for economic , social or cultural reasons .  
Activities in the area of sustainable environmental futures focus on the complex interactions of physical and human activities in changing the environment , especially in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world , and the effects upon sustainability .  
They are increasingly contributing also by encouraging employees to volunteer and by providing , free of charge , their organizational talents , technical skills and physical facilities for raising funds and delivering services .  
It will be a difficult task to bring about national reconciliation , to reconstruct the destroyed physical infrastructure and to lay the ground for a return to normal life for all citizens traumatized by a civil war with unprecedented massacres .  
With small national markets , a weak human resource base , inadequate physical and institutional infrastructures and narrow production structures , the majority of African countries do not meet the requirements to be dynamic economic entities .

" 
By 1973 the time had come to codify these various instruments in a single convention , Convention No . 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment , which is general in scope and obliges States to pursue a national policy designed to secure the effective abolition of child labour and progressively to raise the minimum age for admission to employment to a level enabling young people to attain the fullest possible physical and mental development .

Machel .  
The widespread incorporation of information technology in production and communications has considerably reduced the physical size of factories ( by increasing the versatility of machines , thereby lowering the number of machines required for different sequences of operations ) , expanded the variety of jobs that can be performed , and improved the precision in production and quality control that can be achieved by a worker , and ( through instant information connectivity ) greatly enhanced intra - and inter-firm spatial networking to maximize location-specific advantages .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .

While recognizing the discretionary powers of the courts and tribunals in imposing the penalties prescribed by domestic law for acts of racial discrimination , the Committee had often pointed out that the lightness of the penalties imposed in such cases , some of which had affected the fundamental right to life and physical integrity , was not commensurate with the seriousness of the offences .  
" Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,

Not only treatment causing bodily injury , but also , for example , treatment causing mental suffering and feelings of fear , anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing the victim and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance may amount to such proscribed treatment .  
Secondly , the reasons for raising the minimum age to 18 years are not only associated with recruitment methods but with the physical , psychosocial and emotional impact on the young person , the teaching of military skills and attitudes and the deprivation of opportunities to develop educational and social skills more appropriate for civilian life .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .

Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
While urbanization and economic growth are linked and are regarded as dominant features of national economic development , rapid urbanization will pose enormous challenges for the urban social and physical environment , particularly in terms of the widespread poverty that results from mass unemployment .  
The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
The concept , derived from the Spanish word macho used to describe the strong , brave and aggressive male , praises physical superiority and brutal force , legitimizing stereotypes that affirm inequitable power relations between women and men .  
Law 70 / 95 has a wide and generalized range of application , since it is applicable , with no distinction , to any computerized filing system or data bank , both private and public , owned by either a physical or legal person ( art .  1 ) .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
The Sudan urges the institutions entrusted with ensuring respect for international humanitarian law to institute an inquiry into the savage crimes committed by the Ethiopian Tigray forces against the innocent Sudanese prisoners and detainees in their possession , which have included physical liquidation , so that the perpetrators and war criminals implicated in these practices will not escape the justice of the law .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
The Committee also recommends that a comprehensive and integrated public information campaign be elaborated with a view to preventing and combating all forms of abuse of children and that all necessary measures be taken to ensure the physical and psychological recovery and the social reintegration of children victims of the war , in the light of article 39 of the Convention .  
In light of article 39 of the Convention , the Committee is worried about the insufficient measures taken to provide physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration to children victims of any form of neglect , abuse and / or exploitation , particularly victims of armed conflicts , sexual exploitation and child labour .  
In its general debate , the Committee had further included a reference to all those activities that were dangerous or harmful to the child 's physical , mental and spiritual development or were liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Consequently , there must exist a clear objective - to destroy and to remove an undesirable national , ethnical , racial , or religious group from the population of the State or region either by wholesale physical extermination as such or by the physical extermination of part of the group and forcible expulsion of the others from the defined district , region or State as a whole .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
The Member State also noted that the Secretary-Generals report categorized violence into economic exploitation , social / psychological violence , physical / sexual violence and violence resulting from operation of the legal system and pointed out that non-payment or delay in the payment of wages and / or violation of wages agreed to under contract had been highlighted as a common type of economic exploitation in receiving countries . 
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,

The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
Reaffirms the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous to or interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development ;  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
One such initiative was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , which had recommended that aboriginal women should be specifically included in any process to define the powers of aboriginal governments and should be assured of full and equal participation in decision-making bodies responsible for developing and implementing measures to ensure their physical and emotional security . 
A report by three VSV human rights workers arbitrarily imprisoned in October in a SARM cachot in Kinshasa ( see para . 104 ) is revealing as to the treatment of the inmates there : inhuman and cruel conditions ; constant ill _ treatment , to the point of slavery ; overcrowded cells ( up to 19 inmates ) ; lack of beds ; access to the toilets depending on the warders ' mood ; mental , though not systematically physical torture . 
Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros , which is on the list of least developed countries , is aggravated by several important factors , including its physical distance from its trading partners , the scarcity of natural resources , the diminutive size of the domestic market , the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil ,  
Torture is defined in the latter Declaration as any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession , punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating him or other persons .  
Further , where persons are displaced in circumstances which are consistent with international norms , they have a right to live in conditions in which basic rights to food , housing and health are secured , not to speak of reasonable social amenities and the enjoyment of all other basic rights to life , physical security and public freedoms .  
Article 32 of the Convention recognizes the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .

Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
Calls upon Governments to take legislative , administrative , social and educational measures to ensure the protection of children from economic exploitation , in particular protection from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education or be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development ;  
Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical , psychological and mental health , and urges Governments to guarantee this through free access to health services and the adoption of holistic approaches towards the total well-being of disabled children , which should include :  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
The key characteristics of an enabling environment are well understood and generally accepted : stability , predictability , adaptability , growth orientation , transparent legal and regulatory frameworks , and a strong base of social and physical infrastructures .  
The Committee is deeply concerned by the institutionalized use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline , particularly in schools , as well as at the absence of a comprehensive law that clearly prohibits the use of both mental and physical torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against children .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
It may be inferred from the current case law of the international legal bodies that the basis for determining the amount and nature of the compensation is not solely the physical or material injury or damage but also the direct or indirect moral injury .  
There had been thinly veiled attempts at altering the demographic composition and physical characteristics of the occupied Palestinian territory , incessant human rights violations , plundering of the territory 's natural resources and exploitation of its labour force .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
Experience shows that the best results in entrepreneurial development are attained with programmes to promote and train entrepreneurs that are linked to support services with direct help to the potential entrepreneur in accessing finance , technical , managerial and marketing advice , and suitable physical facilities .  
He believed that the key elements of an enabling environment for development were a growth-oriented economy with a transparent legal and regulatory framework , and strong social and physical infrastructure .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
However , the conduct must go beyond speech which simply angered or distressed : it must be sufficiently persistent and pernicious as to inflict ( or be motivated by a desire to inflict ) substantial emotional or physical harm .

In Cuba , special sanctions are applied to anyone who , while wearing a military uniform or appearing as a public official , violates the physical integrity of a detained woman by sexual abuse or harassment .  
Efforts should be undertaken to prevent and combat economic exploitation or any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
There is , however , a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
These 191 States have committed themselves , under article 27 , to recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development .  
WHO affirmed that the human rights of girls and women , including their rights to bodily integrity and to the highest attainable standard of physical , mental and social well-being , must be protected and promoted .  
Her delegation supported the alternative practices outlined in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 354 ) , including circumcision through words , that focused on the symbolic meaning of that rite of passage but eliminated the harmful physical aspect .  
First , obstacles or barriers ( including political , legal , bureaucratic , physical , financial , social and informational ) should be reduced .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
There is a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
A significant portion of the forest area is unavailable for wood supply because it is in legally protected areas ( national parks , reserves etc . ) , it is not economically viable to harvest ( too far from markets , transport links , infrastructure etc . ) or otherwise constrained ( due to physical inaccessibility , such as steep slopes or swamps , or regulatory constraints , such as general logging or harvesting bans ) .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;

No exceptional circumstance , of whatever kind , whether a state of war or threat of war , domestic political instability or any other exceptional situation may be invoked to justify infringement of these intangible rights : the right to life , the right to physical integrity , the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the right to a fair trial , the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and so forth .  
In order to cater for pupils ' various needs and abilities , the education system comprises schools of different types , forms of ownership and spheres of activity : there are 1,890 general schools , including 270 schools with in-depth study of specific subjects , 65 gymnasiums , 39 lyces , 2 boarding schools for children requiring a special educational and living environment , and 19 specialized schools for children with mental and physical developmental deficiencies .  
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Immigrants are often the victims of verbal abuse and physical violence on the part of militants from ultra _ rightist parties and extremist and xenophobic organizations , as well as of growing institutional racism , discriminatory legislation and harsh police repression . 
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Despite the appalling number of dead ( see below ) , a substantial majority of Cambodians survived this period , although the long-term impact on the country remains incalculable because the educated and skilled were especially targeted and because of the psychological and physical scars left on the survivors .  
The accused must undertake one of a series of acts - killing , causing serious bodily or mental harm ; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction ; imposing measures intended to prevent births ; and forcibly transferring children from the group ; ( b ) The accused must do so against a " national , ethnical , racial or religious group " ;  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Lastly , it should be noted that there remain principal subjects of concern that have a bearing on economic , social and cultural issues , such as the problem of violence against women in all its aspects , including sexual abuse , physical and mental ill-treatment , sexual exploitation of children and sexual harassment at work , which represent a pattern of human rights violations calling for firm and persistent action at the various levels of the State and within civil society .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
The law on national education reflected the provisions of article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by stipulating that education should be directed to the moral , intellectual and physical development of children and should provide them with the basic knowledge they needed to live in society and to have an impact on the countrys socio-economic situation . 
The aims of Covenant House are : to identify and attempt to assist in solving the problems of the urban poor , especially abandoned or neglected children ; to explore and participate in the identification of the social , psychological and physical problems of these children ; and to stimulate public awareness of the need for effective youth-care facilities .  
Recognizing that the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .

The employed person 's salary is augmented in case of work in conditions which are more difficult than normal for a particular job ( climate , noise , vibrations , irradiation , humidity , harmful gases , biologically harmful substances , physical strain , work with dirty materials , danger caused by tools or objects , means of transport , waste materials , electricity , explosions , heat , corrosive materials , etc . ) , which need to be made specific by special or individual collective agreements .  
Contributing factors to the marine environmental deterioration include oil exploration and exploitation , rapid economic growth , overfishing , physical alteration of the coastlines by dredging and filling , discharge of raw sewage , disposal of untreated industrial effluents , and dumping wasted oil and debris .  
Strongly condemns physical , sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family , which encompasses , but is not limited to , battering , sexual abuse of female children in the household , dowry-related violence , marital rape , female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women , non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation ;

This will lead to the design of policy packages aimed at increasing physical and human capacities , taking into account the administrative requirements of such packages , sustainability concerns related to expanded production , the social and human context of polices related to international trade , and complementary measures .  The generation and optimal use of domestic finance for commodity-based development will also be part of these packages .  
Since the enactment of proper legislation to protect children was essential to their healthy physical , mental and psychological development , Iran had adopted certain legal measures , including the establishment of special courts to protect the family , and had modified article 1173 of the civil code regarding child custody to recognize the mothers role in guardianship .

Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
We also finance the operating subsidy of the RMS St . Helena , at present the sole regular means of physical access to the island ( an examination of the economic feasibility of developing an eventual air link is currently under way , alongside our discussions with the United States Government about opening up Wideawake Airfield on Ascension to civilian charter flights ) .  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .  
The focus of the programme is on areas related to satellite communications : satellite remote sensing for natural resources and environmental survey ; development of facilities for designing , assembly / fabrication and launching of communication satellites in geostationary orbit and light-weight satellites in near-Earth orbit for various scientific and applications purposes ; and study of natural and physical phenomena in the upper atmosphere and space through rocket launchings and other means .

Each State Party shall consider implementing measures , in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and local communities , to provide for the physical , psychological and social recovery and , when requested , spiritual assistance of victims of and witnesses to crimes covered by this Protocol , in order to foster their health , self-respect and dignity , as well as their education and employment opportunities , in a manner appropriate to their age , gender and special needs .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
The introduction of high-capacity digital telephone lines ( the integrated services digital network , or ISDN ) brought about a significant lowering of communications costs and prompted consideration of remote interpretation as a possible means of increasing cost-effectiveness in the use of staff resources and improving the actual utilization of physical meetings facilities in different conference centres .  
Proceeding from the concern of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to raise the standard of physical , psychological and social health of mothers and children , several maternal and child care centres were established , offering women free premarital and antenatal care , which continues until after delivery in view of the close link between a child 's health and that of its mother .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .

The Committee remains concerned about the conditions faced by children deprived of liberty , particularly children detained with adults without adequate protection from inhumane treatment , and about the insufficiency of programmes for the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of juveniles .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .  
The Recommendation enumerates the factors to be taken into account in determining the types of hazardous work , for example , work which exposes children to physical , psychological or sexual abuse ; work underground , or at dangerous heights ; work with dangerous machinery ; and work in an unhealthy environment .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the " Issues for consideration " document provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
Advancing international understanding through programmes which call for broad application of the universal language of arts and humanities , the social behavioural , and physical sciences , and related disciplines , including but not limited to comparative studies and consultations on related public policy issues ;  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species , that is to say , organisms which , at the harvestable stage , either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the document on issues for consideration provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .

" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
Their coach , physical education professor Wu Teng-ta tells us : " The props for drum dancing are quite simple ; cymbals are all you need for backup accompaniment . Also the movements are lively and beautifully patterned , making this kind of dance perfect for high school and primary school students learning traditional folk dances . " The students of Taitung Normal College can take elective courses in drum dancing , so that some day they may pass along the art to their own students .  
A Moving Competition : Huang Chin-tsuan , who led the team to Japan , notes the vigor of Japan 's paralympic athletics program , with its organizations and centers spread out all over the country . Their volunteers are thickly distributed and knowledgeable . Huang says enviously , " Even more importantly , regular school phys-ed teachers are prepared with knowledge about the physical education needs of the handicapped , so that disabled students , under the appropriate care , can participate in phys-ed class . "  
He says that in South Africa there is a scientist who has studied black eagles for more than twenty years . The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
The Mu-Kuang Rehabilitation Center is now located in Tungshan Rural Township , Ilan County , on a 4300 m2 site . As well as professional instructors , audio-assisted braille teaching equipment and an all-round education and training program , the Center has a library , a massage teaching room , a scented garden for the blind , and so on . These comprehensive facilities are intended to cater to all the needs of the students from their education and physical well being to their preparation for later life .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude . After four years of professional baseball , there are still many shortcomings to be urgently addressed . But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .  
If the children 's schoolwork is poor , if they do n't have the right attitude for studying , if they do n't get along with their teachers or classmates . . . . these are all problems that make parents anxious . The mass media is continually emphasizing that good academic work is not enough , and that a complete education should give equal emphasis to ethics , physical education , group consciousness , and fine arts as well . Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
After he returned to Japan , Ho 's worsening stomach ailment forced him to undergo surgery . The healing process was torturous , and to make matters worse , the Second World War had broken out . Under the pall of such physical and spiritual pain , the painter put down his brush . His brush had stopped , but he remained alive at heart .  
Then people would start yelling or crying or having other strong emotional reactions . When the physical problems appeared , Mesmer and his assistants would massage the afflicted part of the body to " prompt the magnetic fluid to pass through . " The results appeared to be quite good .  
He viewed his patient 's emotional and physical state sparked by painful past experiences as a kind of " unusual mental power . " Wang is the first to employ the powers of mental projection , determination and imagination as used by Eastern religious devotees to deal with these " negative energies . "  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Among those elected , the five in the category of math and physical sciences are all engineering specialists , suggesting that applied science is being given increasing importance within the Academia Sinica . There was more diversity in the biology / chemistry group , with electees including specialists in medicine , neurology and molecular biology . The social science and humanities group , meanwhile , following an old tradition , continued to be dominated by economists .  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) . Results are only likely to be visible after three to five years , and it 's a one-in-a-million shot that one can grit one 's teeth and hang in until becoming a big player .  
She says frankly that the thing a judge fears most is breaking a big case " in an ugly way , " when the physical evidence at the scene has been destroyed in rescuing the survivors , making it impossible to take samples which could be submitted for scientific analysis ( for example , DNA matching for bloodstains ) . In such cases , there are only the court witnesses and the eyewitnesses ' indirect evidence , which are much less persuasive .  
Society in Taiwan puts paramount im-portance on academic advancement . The call for a balanced education , in which ethical , intellectual , physical , social and artistic development are given equal stress , has long been regarded as a far-off ideal that gets lip service only .  
At the same time , new standardized physical fitness tests have been announced for all of Taiwan 's elementary schools and junior and senior high schools . So balanced education is no longer just a distant ideal . It has become a trend of the times .  
The King Car Educational Foundation , whose stated purpose is to promote basic education for children and adolescents , carried out physical examinations on 200 sixth graders at the Hsingan Elementary School , and the results were even more startling . Of the students tested , many fell short of the Ministry of Education 's reference value : 91 percent fell short for muscular endurance , 86 percent for instantaneous force , and 41 percent for cardiopulmonary endurance .  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
Taiwan 's mainstream educational structure is divided into the five categories of ethics , scholastic learning , physical education , social skills and the fine arts . Among these , the category of scholastic learning has always been given the greatest weight . Yet the recent craze for " EQ , " with its emphasis on self-discipline , interpersonal relationships , emotional expressiveness and a balance between the mind and body , could be described as encompassing things ethical , physical , social and artistic .  
Because the theory of EQ includes a balanced , multifaceted educational perspective that emphasizes both the mental and physical aspects of individuals ' emotions , it has not only become popular among the population at large , but has also garnered considerable interest in the academic community , being seen as compatible with the call to educational reform .  
Today , people are too busy trying to maintain the minimum requirements for their physical existences to have that kind of relaxed , merry perspective on life . I 'm afraid few people indeed are able to address the real world with a " heart of frequent leisure . "  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
After returning from New York with his MFA degree and restarting the Kuang Huan Dance Circle , Liou drew upon his extensive practice of taijiquan , qigong and yoga , and made " qi , " " body " and " mind " the troupe 's new guiding principles-when free circulation of the qi ( breath or vital energy ) is achieved , a person becomes light and nimble , and develops a greater sensitivity toward nuances of space and time ; body refers the physical body , and mind to one 's thoughts , will and intentions .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Every two years , Dr . Lai Chiu-nan , originator of the " total natural health " lifestyle , based on a " living foods " diet , comes to Taiwan to promote her method for maintaining a healthy body , mind and spirit . Her talks always draw thousands of people . In March of this year , she came to Taiwan again to hold a workshop , leading 600 people in physical and mental training in the mountains of Shuanghsi in Taipei County .  
With the opening of the domestic telecommunications market , TransAsia Telecommunications won the right to operate a cellular telephone business in southern Taiwan . The company established its headquarters in Kaohsiung but could n't find a marketing manager . Eventually , the company had to go through a head hunter which found them Sean Hsieh in Taipei . Hsieh had worked as a sales strategist at an advertising firm and as a marketing strategist at a producer of physical education products before he was hired to be TransAsia 's marketing manager .  
Although this is a new and ambitious research project and no one can tell if it will succeed or not , the chance to help numerous people improve their nutritional intake , physical condition and thus national educational levels and competitiveness , is well worth the effort .  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
Disaster struck again in October at the 10,000-man tug-of-war organized by the Taipei City Government when the rope broke , causing two people to lose arms and others to suffer internal injuries . Anticipating that in addition to the physical injuries , there would be some who would need to be treated for psychological shock , Hu Wei-herng , director of the Taipei City Psychiatric Center , worked together with a psychiatric team from Mackay Memorial Hospital to evaluate the emotional state of the victims .  
Six children had been severely burned during an experiment in a " talent " class when , through carelessness , the alcohol ignited causing an explosion and fire . A Mr . and Mrs . Wang Tsung-yuan , who had returned to Taiwan after living abroad in Canada , realized that their badly burned nine-year-old son would need psychological care in addition to physical treatment . They immediately asked the hospital to arrange it for them and encouraged the parents of the other children to talk to psychologists as well .  
Daoism retained the ancient belief in immortality , and developed various theories on how to create elixirs both external and internal . Daoists believed that through physical and mental exercises , or by ingesting elixirs hidden in sacred mountains , a person might transcend his corporeal form and become an immortal , to frolic in the heavenly paradise with the kings and emperors of yore and the gods of nature such as the wind , rain , thunder and lightning .  
Zhuangzi ( Chuang-tzu ) states that if one 's view of the world is clouded by preconceptions and expectations , then it is impossible to live beyond the physical limitations faced by ordinary human beings , for one is not living in harmony with the " Dao " of the universe .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
He explains that when a patient first comes into the hospital , he is examined by a psychiatrist who treats his acute symptoms , such as insomnia , anxiety or depression . After his symptoms have been moderated , a clinical psychologist evaluates the patient 's personality and his physical and mental condition . Based on this , the clinical psychologist then provides counseling . If the patient 's abilities have deteriorated , an occupational therapist designs a rehabilitation program , which might include planning some recreational activities or interpersonal relations training .  
These expensive anti-aging therapies begin with a thorough physical evaluation . In addition to a standard check-up , such an evaluation examines the extent to which aging has affected bodily functions ; hormone , blood sugar , cholesterol and mineral levels , as well as resistance to oxidants , bone density and organ function are all checked . An appropriate anti-aging regimen is then developed based on the results of these tests .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
In Love in a Small Town , Wang intentionally avoids detailed description of the main characters ' backgrounds or their social milieu . She also keeps narrative comment to a minimum . Instead , the carefully constructed mood of her story conveys the process by which two minor actors-young , spirited and in close physical proximity every day-discover , through force of instinct , their sexuality .  
Two important pieces of legislation were passed in regard to educating the populace . The " Citizens ' Education Law " was modified to encourage private individuals to engage in private education . The principle of " nine years of continuous compulsory education " was revised to state that " curricula shall center around students ' all-round mental and physical development and emphasize continuity . "  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes . In addition to this physical suffering , before the introduction of universal health insurance in Taiwan kidney disease was a tremendous financial burden for patients ; now that dialysis is covered by National Health Insurance , it is a substantial item of the system 's expenditure .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
In taijiquan , much is made of the need to remain loose , soft , supple and still , and key elements in training include keeping the head erect , the shoulders loose , elbows down , wrists supple , hips loose and feet firmly planted on the ground . For dancers trained from an early age in the Western discipline , with its frequent calls for physical exertion and gravity-defying leaps , this is a total departure .  
Chiang Ta-shu notes that a disaster on this scale creates more needs than can be met in the short term . At present , as far as supplying the basic physical needs of the population in the stricken areas is concerned , things are already functioning fairly smoothly . " But after that there are even more problems , such as the victims ' psychological rehabilitation , along with education and culture , and promoting any of these requires intensive , long-term work . "  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
Holding that meditation will , along with natural science and behavioral science , emerge as one of the three most important educational disciplines , WLEF has designed a Zen leadership program that emphasizes state of mind . Students are encouraged to probe their inner selves during moments of solitude and thereby cultivate self-discipline , increase their wisdom and potential , and improve their physical endurance and ability to handle pressure . They learn both how to get involved in the world and how to morally transcend it .  
Every traditional culture in the world has magic amulets ( geometric shapes , bones , insects or animals ) that bring good luck , ward off evil , or affect the physical or mental condition of other people , or that even , with the appropriate incantations , put you online to the supernatural world .  
With regard to some ancient amulets that are supposed to be able to inflict physical harm , Li takes a stab at a more scientific-sounding explanation . Take for example an amulet whose characters are written out using a combination of bodily fluids from a corpse and chicken blood . Perhaps , avers Li , the bacteria in the bodily fluids of the corpse reproduce by using the chicken blood as a nutrient . Someone drinking such a mix would probably get sick .  
Leaving behind peaceful , picturesque Tsaotun , we come to Puli Township , which is a center of art , culture and scenic beauty . Downtown Puli is bustling and appears completely restored , but in the surrounding boroughs and villages many problems still hamper both physical reconstruction and economic recovery .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
" Perhaps digital content is no different in its basic nature from the writing , language , physical artifacts and images , and video programs we have long been familiar with , " explains Hwang Tai-yang . But once information of all kinds is digitized , and converted into virtual ones and zeros that can flow as an electric current , there will no longer be any obstacles to its crossing platforms to be transmitted , stored , accessed and used at will .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
Taken together , these two incidents suggested new possibilities about how people can live their lives . Both featured people who are known as " transgenders " - those who do not fit into traditional male-female gender patterns . Uncomfortable with their physical sex as determined by their chromosomes , they feel driven to change their outward appearance into one that their mind can identify with .  
" Wellness centers " tout their ability to stave off aging , and woo customers with scented hot spring baths , quartz sound wave therapy , and whole-body pummeling with contoured mallets . They stress that these therapies can adjust slight lopsidedness or other deformations of the spine caused by modern people 's poor posture , thus restoring mental and physical balance .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
For example , they categorized the Aborigines into groups based on criteria like mutual intelligibility of language , physical characteristics , social structure ( for example , the Puyuma and Amis had matriarchal societies , the Rukai and Paiwan had aristocratic classes ) , and religious beliefs ( e.g . ancestral worship , the belief in pygmy spirits ) . It was only at this point that the division of Taiwan 's Aboriginal peoples into nine tribes appeared .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author . At the very beginning Yao seeks to make clear the purpose and meaning of such art with the following definition : " In general terms installation art refers to an expressive method not a style . In the main it focuses on artistic behavior or approaches undertaken in a physical or conceptual space .  
The result of the conflict between virus and immune system is a fever , cough and other immune reactions . Thus the disease begins to spread via airborne droplets and physical contact . This occurs when one comes into contact with the oral and / or nasal secretions of the patient or with infected fecal matter and then touches the lining of one 's own mouth , eyes or nose . There are no receptors on the skin itself , so becoming infected by skin contact is unlikely .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
It is a great pity , but as the number of graduation credits required to graduate from the vocational system has declined over the years , and with no rules indicating the minimum number of credits to be earned from practical work , related classes have come under pressure . As a result , many private schools have chosen to cut subjects that involve physical work or extra financing , which ensures students are given fewer and fewer opportunities to familiarize themselves with actual physical operations .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Loss events can be the loss of one 's health , such as a fatal disease , an intractable chronic illness , or physical disability ; the loss of a loved one , such as the death or departure of a close friend or relative ; the loss of one 's job or property ; or seeing one 's cherished hopes dashed , such as suddenly finding out that one 's spouse has a lover .  
The town charter , carved on a black tablet in front of the town hall , is less a set of regulations than a gentle reminder of the townsfolk 's common ideals , and the Shikatsu Historical and Folklore Museum , situated behind the town hall , could be considered a physical manifestation of these very ideals .  
To put into practice this ideal of caring for the elderly , Shikatsu-once voted Japan 's best town-has allocated close to 1.5% of its annual budget to the museum and library , and an astonishing amount of human and physical resources have been put into them .  
In my youthful enthusiasm for that novel adventure I blithely forgot that I had always only barely made the grade in terms of physical fitness , and busily set about buying my first rucksack , my first pair of hiking boots , and a full set of warm outdoor clothes . In the biting cold of the seventh day of the lunar New Year , I excitedly set off on my first aeroplane flight , to Taichung where the group was to assemble .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
The chief executive of the LBMA said that the main cause of the increase in silver business was a high level of physical demand and increased activity in the forward market  
Activities that are dangerous or harmful to the child 's harmonious physical , mental and spiritual development or are liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child ;  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
Certain women who are subject to physical or sexual violence by their drugusing partners or parents may none the less feel responsible for caring for their families or may be without alternative means of livelihood for economic , social or cultural reasons .  
Activities in the area of sustainable environmental futures focus on the complex interactions of physical and human activities in changing the environment , especially in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world , and the effects upon sustainability .  
They are increasingly contributing also by encouraging employees to volunteer and by providing , free of charge , their organizational talents , technical skills and physical facilities for raising funds and delivering services .  
It will be a difficult task to bring about national reconciliation , to reconstruct the destroyed physical infrastructure and to lay the ground for a return to normal life for all citizens traumatized by a civil war with unprecedented massacres .  
With small national markets , a weak human resource base , inadequate physical and institutional infrastructures and narrow production structures , the majority of African countries do not meet the requirements to be dynamic economic entities . 
Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
This representative would be enabled contacts with the responsible federal and republican bodies and nongovernmental organizations , on the understanding that he would be in no position to undertake investigative action visvis domestic physical persons .  
A smaller number of resettlement places is required , predominantly for selected individuals whose physical security is threatened , or for vulnerable refugees for whom resettlement remains the only suitable , durable and humane solution .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .

Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;

The urgent appeal procedure is not per se accusatory , but essentially preventive in nature and purpose .  The Government concerned is merely requested to look into the matter and to take steps aimed at protecting the right to physical and mental integrity of the person concerned , in accordance with the international human rights standards .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
The concept , derived from the Spanish word macho used to describe the strong , brave and aggressive male , praises physical superiority and brutal force , legitimizing stereotypes that affirm inequitable power relations between women and men .  
Law 70 / 95 has a wide and generalized range of application , since it is applicable , with no distinction , to any computerized filing system or data bank , both private and public , owned by either a physical or legal person ( art .  1 ) .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
The Sudan urges the institutions entrusted with ensuring respect for international humanitarian law to institute an inquiry into the savage crimes committed by the Ethiopian Tigray forces against the innocent Sudanese prisoners and detainees in their possession , which have included physical liquidation , so that the perpetrators and war criminals implicated in these practices will not escape the justice of the law .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
The Committee also recommends that a comprehensive and integrated public information campaign be elaborated with a view to preventing and combating all forms of abuse of children and that all necessary measures be taken to ensure the physical and psychological recovery and the social reintegration of children victims of the war , in the light of article 39 of the Convention .  
In light of article 39 of the Convention , the Committee is worried about the insufficient measures taken to provide physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration to children victims of any form of neglect , abuse and / or exploitation , particularly victims of armed conflicts , sexual exploitation and child labour .  
In its general debate , the Committee had further included a reference to all those activities that were dangerous or harmful to the child 's physical , mental and spiritual development or were liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Consequently , there must exist a clear objective - to destroy and to remove an undesirable national , ethnical , racial , or religious group from the population of the State or region either by wholesale physical extermination as such or by the physical extermination of part of the group and forcible expulsion of the others from the defined district , region or State as a whole .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
The Member State also noted that the Secretary-Generals report categorized violence into economic exploitation , social / psychological violence , physical / sexual violence and violence resulting from operation of the legal system and pointed out that non-payment or delay in the payment of wages and / or violation of wages agreed to under contract had been highlighted as a common type of economic exploitation in receiving countries . 
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .

Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Deeply concerned about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child , which often result in less access for girls to education , nutrition , physical and mental health care and to girls enjoying fewer rights , opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys and often being subjected to various forms of cultural , social , sexual and economic exploitation and to violence and harmful practices such as incest , early marriage , female infanticide , prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation ,  
Invites States to allocate resources to provide comprehensive programmes designed to heal and to rehabilitate into society child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation , including through job training , legal assistance and confidential health care , and to take all appropriate measures to promote their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration ;  
Reaffirms the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous to or interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development ;  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Deplores the immense human suffering and loss of life that have accompanied refugee flows and other forced displacements , in particular the numerous serious threats to the security or well-being of refugees , such as refoulement , unlawful expulsion , physical attacks and detention under unacceptable conditions , and calls upon States to take all measures necessary to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection , including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers in accordance with internationally recognized human rights and humanitarian norms ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
In rural settings , where women have little access to resources to pay for transport and where roads are likely to be poor and vehicles rare , the physical barriers involved render the use even of routine prenatal care services complicated and use of services for complications and emergencies is difficult .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
Every new charge made by Cuba is supported by more than $ 60-billion in losses and that is not a full assessment by an economy distorted by the war conditions imposed on us , and by the incalculable human , physical and psychological damage we have sustained .  
Thailand therefore agrees with the importance of the people-centred approach to development put forward by the Copenhagen Summit , which emphasizes that development can not be sustained in the long run if it is based only on purely physical economic growth , without due consideration of human and other social and environmental dimensions .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .

One such initiative was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , which had recommended that aboriginal women should be specifically included in any process to define the powers of aboriginal governments and should be assured of full and equal participation in decision-making bodies responsible for developing and implementing measures to ensure their physical and emotional security . 
A report by three VSV human rights workers arbitrarily imprisoned in October in a SARM cachot in Kinshasa ( see para . 104 ) is revealing as to the treatment of the inmates there : inhuman and cruel conditions ; constant ill _ treatment , to the point of slavery ; overcrowded cells ( up to 19 inmates ) ; lack of beds ; access to the toilets depending on the warders ' mood ; mental , though not systematically physical torture .

Housing , being the most important single investment in the life of the majority of the world 's population , should not be considered only in its aspect of physical shelter , but should be given full consideration as the most important element of family life where all social , economic , cultural and political activities begin and are sustained .  
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical , psychological and mental health , and urges Governments to guarantee this through free access to health services and the adoption of holistic approaches towards the total well-being of disabled children , which should include :  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
On the basis of the bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments signed in recent years , and taking into account the development and intensification of trade and economic relations and also the existence of cooperative links in the past , the parties have reached the conclusion that there is a need to promote in every possible way cooperation in such areas as transport , communications , energy supply , engineering , agriculture , in science and technology and military technology , the environment , humanitarian assistance , tourism , physical culture and sports .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .  
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
The key characteristics of an enabling environment are well understood and generally accepted : stability , predictability , adaptability , growth orientation , transparent legal and regulatory frameworks , and a strong base of social and physical infrastructures .  
The Committee is deeply concerned by the institutionalized use of corporal punishment as a means of discipline , particularly in schools , as well as at the absence of a comprehensive law that clearly prohibits the use of both mental and physical torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against children .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .

Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
The explanation for that situation lay in the accumulation of such factors as poor physical infrastructure , a generally unskilled labour force , high levels of indebtedness , high inflation and small domestic markets , problems which the African countries must face up to by seeking to establish sound macroeconomic equilibrium and suitable infrastructure , and by investing in social programmes to promote the integration of their people in the global system .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
Experience shows that the best results in entrepreneurial development are attained with programmes to promote and train entrepreneurs that are linked to support services with direct help to the potential entrepreneur in accessing finance , technical , managerial and marketing advice , and suitable physical facilities .  
He believed that the key elements of an enabling environment for development were a growth-oriented economy with a transparent legal and regulatory framework , and strong social and physical infrastructure .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .

The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
We are prepared to join in all efforts , which must be global , because no country of the world is free from this enormous evil that threatens to destroy the spiritual and moral resources and the very physical well-being of our youth .  
There is , however , a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
These 191 States have committed themselves , under article 27 , to recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development .  
WHO affirmed that the human rights of girls and women , including their rights to bodily integrity and to the highest attainable standard of physical , mental and social well-being , must be protected and promoted .

Good governance , which is an important prerequisite for sustained socio-economic development , is undermined through lost economic productivity , the destruction of physical and social infrastructure , refugees , environmental degradation and human suffering .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
There is a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
A significant portion of the forest area is unavailable for wood supply because it is in legally protected areas ( national parks , reserves etc . ) , it is not economically viable to harvest ( too far from markets , transport links , infrastructure etc . ) or otherwise constrained ( due to physical inaccessibility , such as steep slopes or swamps , or regulatory constraints , such as general logging or harvesting bans ) .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .

In order to cater for pupils ' various needs and abilities , the education system comprises schools of different types , forms of ownership and spheres of activity : there are 1,890 general schools , including 270 schools with in-depth study of specific subjects , 65 gymnasiums , 39 lyces , 2 boarding schools for children requiring a special educational and living environment , and 19 specialized schools for children with mental and physical developmental deficiencies .  
The Special Rapporteur observes that the human tragedy of this unresolved matter is enormous , both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship , and in terms of the families of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .  
Immigrants are often the victims of verbal abuse and physical violence on the part of militants from ultra _ rightist parties and extremist and xenophobic organizations , as well as of growing institutional racism , discriminatory legislation and harsh police repression . 
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Despite the appalling number of dead ( see below ) , a substantial majority of Cambodians survived this period , although the long-term impact on the country remains incalculable because the educated and skilled were especially targeted and because of the psychological and physical scars left on the survivors .  
The accused must undertake one of a series of acts - killing , causing serious bodily or mental harm ; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction ; imposing measures intended to prevent births ; and forcibly transferring children from the group ; ( b ) The accused must do so against a " national , ethnical , racial or religious group " ;

Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
We also finance the operating subsidy of the RMS St . Helena , at present the sole regular means of physical access to the island ( an examination of the economic feasibility of developing an eventual air link is currently under way , alongside our discussions with the United States Government about opening up Wideawake Airfield on Ascension to civilian charter flights ) .  
Although there was a drop in the number of reported cases of gross human rights violations during March , escapees from rebel-held territories continued to provide disturbing accounts of abusive rebel behaviour against civilians , including physical and psychological torture and harassment .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .

The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
The introduction of high-capacity digital telephone lines ( the integrated services digital network , or ISDN ) brought about a significant lowering of communications costs and prompted consideration of remote interpretation as a possible means of increasing cost-effectiveness in the use of staff resources and improving the actual utilization of physical meetings facilities in different conference centres .  
Proceeding from the concern of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to raise the standard of physical , psychological and social health of mothers and children , several maternal and child care centres were established , offering women free premarital and antenatal care , which continues until after delivery in view of the close link between a child 's health and that of its mother .

Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .

Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The Agency also reported that a new technical cooperation project had been initiated , entitled Physical Protection and Security of Nuclear Materials , designed to increase the national capacity in countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear materials , as well as for the prevention of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials .  
The natural resources referred to in this Part consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species , that is to say , organisms which , at the harvestable stage , either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the document on issues for consideration provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .

Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
An integrated , collaborative and coordinated approach to facilities policy , administrative and budgetary information exchange is being formulated to promote effective and efficient planning , management , maintenance and operation for all Headquarters and overseas physical facilities of the Organization .  
We emphasize that , in addition to the direct impact on the physical infrastructure of the health , education , housing and human settlements sectors , one of the principal effects of natures ravages on the population is their increased vulnerability to disease and the deterioration of nutritional and food security ; it is therefore essential to give priority to these aspects on the regional integration agenda .  
Where the facility is operated pursuant to a governmental licence , private ownership of physical assets ( e.g . a telecommunication network ) is often separable from the licence to provide the service to the public ( e.g . long-distance telephone services ) , in that the licence can be withdrawn by the competent public authority under certain circumstances .  
In the reformed system , schools will provide students with the opportunity for the comprehensive development of their personalities , including the development of their physical , emotional , intellectual , moral and spiritual potential .

However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
There is new scientific evidence and practical experience to support this statement : on the impact of health and nutritional status ( such as iodine deficiency ) and early stimulation on the development of the brain ; on the importance of early socialization patterns and the quality of the childs immediate environment ; and on the critical influence these determinants have on later physical , cognitive , emotional and social development .  
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .

Since it could be argued that , with better visual information , the health impact perhaps would have been less significant , a major recommendation derived from the first experiment was that , in future experiments , technological solutions had to be sought that might bring the physical environment of remote interpretation as close as possible to normal on-site conditions .  
After the second experiment , it is evident that , so long as maintaining an acceptable level of quality of service in a new working mode requires additional physical and psychological effort , typical individual workloads expected during on-site work would need to be reduced if remote interpretation were to be used . 
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .

In terms of its real meaning , it bespoke a balance of terror , a cold-war calculation that the physical security and ultimate fate of hundreds of millions of human beings had to be held hostage to the prospect of instant annihilation .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .
