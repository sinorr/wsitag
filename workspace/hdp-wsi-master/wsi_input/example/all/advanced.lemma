The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Without concentrating our energy , we can neither accelerate development nor bring true its advancedment and since the productive forces of our country never experienced a full development under capitalist conditions , we must complete , under socialist conditions , the task of industrialization and economic socialization , marketization , and modernization which advanced countries will complete under capitalist conditions .

However , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
In other words , this kind of advanced nature is not abstract but is historically , concretely , and comprehensively embodied in the " three represents , " namely representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
As long as our party always becomes the faithful representative of the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China our party can always establish itself in an unassailable position , always enjoy the heartfelt support of the people of all nationalities in the whole country , and lead the people to constantly forge ahead .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
Speaking in this sense , the " three represents " is the foundation for our establishing the party , the source of our strength , and the basics of our life as well as the concrete embodiment of those excellent traditions of our Party like integrating theories with practice , maintaining close links with the masses , waging arduous struggles , and so on in the practice of our party leading the people to develop social productive forces , flourish advanced culture , and realize fundamental interests of the people and the intrinsic excellent characters of the party .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
Representing the development needs of advanced social productive forces , representing the forward direction of advanced culture , and representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people are closely interrelated and can embody the essential needs of socialism .  Of these three , the overriding one is representing the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .

This is the marked difference between reserve forces and active military units .  To counter this , first political commissars of reserve forces must , when doing ideological and political work , embrace an advanced consciousness and must be fast in making judgement , in transmitting instructions , in giving feedback signals , and in tracking the results .  This is the only way to succeed .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "

"  
Today , by stressing that our party should always represent the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , Comrade Jiang Zemin has upheld and further elaborated , under the present new situation , the most fundamental realistic foundation and philosophical prerequisite of the party-building theories respectively put forward by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
So long as it always becomes a loyal representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces , the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .

Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The requirements set by the third-generation core of party leadership have been conscientiously carried out , and constant attention has been paid to educating the army in advanced ideology , ethics , science , and culture and encouraging and inspiring officers and men with fine intellectual products ; as a result , they have in different periods of time created a number of fine literary and artistic works embodying the spirit and giving full scope to the central theme of the times .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
This is not only beneficial to stimulating trade and international resources , but is also helpful in alleviating the contradiction of domestic oversupply .  It is beneficial toward developing an economy of scale and will help to effectively attract advanced foreign technology and management experience .  Moreover , direct overseas investment will be beneficial in terms of employee training and introduction .  
In recent years , the Chinese military has greatly improved war readiness , training , routine work , living conditions , and other infrastructure conditions .  Basic construction in operational command at the army corps level organs , in war readiness duty , and in automatic network centers has taken initial shape , reached a relatively advanced level , thus providing excellent conditions and effective guarantees for leading organs to practice effective organization , command , and routine management over the troop units .  
While inspecting Guangdong Province in February of this year , General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out that , " Only if our Party is from start to finish the developmental requirement of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of advance of China 's advanced culture , and the faithful representative of the basic interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , only then can our Party forever occupy an invincible position , always obtain the wholehearted support of all the people of this nation , and continually lead the people forward .

All troops should associate singing these songs with ideological and political education , enthusiastically respond to Chairman Jiang 's call that " the military 's civilization construction should proceed at the forefront of the whole society " , make effort to become exemplary figures who put into practice , and enthusiastically spread this advanced ideology and culture .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .

The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .

After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .

This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .

Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .

They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
After assuming office , however , Bush , out of consideration for relieving pressure from the US economic slowdown , first advanced a massive tax cut program and soon afterward announced the cancellation of " mandatory reduction targets " for major greenhouse gas emitters , overturning his campaign promise .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
The important thinking of the " three represents " profoundly reveals the age-oriented meaning of the Party 's advanced nature in light of this new period , provides the fundamental theoretical basis for correctly carrying forward the advanced nature of Party members , allows us to understand this nature from a new angle and raises our understanding to a higher level .

As to some existing backward modes of production that do not go along with the development requirements of advanced productive forces and the development of the times , we can not repel them summarily and unrealistically ; nor should we take the attitude of being satisfied with what the things are and protecting what is backward .  Instead , we should be realistic and prepare the conditions for transforming , improving , and upgrading them and , through prolonged efforts , gradually make them advanced and applicable .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .

Faced with the serious situation of an ever-increasing number of various kinds of major , disastrous , accidental explosions which are causing huge losses to the national economy , the economic and science and technology spheres in China have joined forces to attack the problem .  Importing the world 's advanced technologies , and innovating on our own , has enabled China to make a major breakthrough in the research and application of explosion suppression materials .  
While importing and absorbing internationally advanced technologies , on their own they also research , developed , and set up a technological platform and machinery production base for advanced explosion suppressing materials .

This term , the most conscientious and advanced elements , applies to that portion of people who are proficient in scientific Marxist theory , who understand the law of social development , who define their historical mission , and who represent the basic interests of the overwhelming majority of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
We should never rush headlong into mass action without first understanding these questions and we should never open the doors of Party organizations without holding those members of the new social strata who do not meet the requirements of membership and are erroneously recruited into the Party to a high standard of review or let them infringe on the Party 's nature as one of the vanguard of the working class and or pollute the advanced nature of our Party .  
To increase the rapid response capability of the base for accidental events on the sea , the base 's logistics leaders and units have vigorously developed the maritime emergency support services .  They have organized emergency support subunits out of defense logistics , arms and equipment , and military supply departments .  They have equipped them with light and advanced logistic facilities as well as conducted special training for them so that they can promptly provide maritime logistical support on receipt of an order .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
They have procured most advanced radar equipment at home and equipped themselves with some first-rate international-level advanced radar equipment capable of making automatic adjusted target detection , extraction of radar information , and target tracking .  The equipment is all solid-state , with self-detection and micro processing capability .  Their outstanding features lie in high anti-interference capability and in being adapted to making up for the deficiency in the low-attitude blind spot in the air defense system .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
adopt multiple forms , utilize foreign capital in an active , rational , and effective way , pay greater attention to importing advanced technology , modern management , and people with professional skills while absorbing foreign capital ;  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Over 60 qualified military and technical personnel and 34 university students who were from the current term entered the base and settled down , while scores of directing and dispatching personnel pursued advanced studies in colleges and institutes .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
In light of tactical requirements , the group army made comprehensive use of the technical achievements , and used advanced technical achievements as powerful and effective technical support for implementation of the tactics .  The group army enriched the methods of logistical and equipment support , and it promoted development and innovation in patterns of support .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
This has been proven by practice of fundamental , universal , long duration , great importance , which has a bearing on the long-term development of the party 's cause .  Only when this issue is solved properly , can our party always retain its advanced and revolutionary nature and creativity and can it establish itself in an unassailable position .

Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
The Speech sums up the basic experiences of the CPC over the past 80 years , looks forward to the tremendous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , and profoundly points out that for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must , in sum , always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .

At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
3 .  The " speech " uses the " three represents " important idea to sums up history , analyze reality , and look into the future ; reveals the scientific connotation of representing the requirement of the development of the advanced productive forces , the orientation of the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , as well as their inherent relationships ; and uses the " three represents " as a guideline to put forward the basic tasks of stepping up and improving party building .  
At the same time , we should continue to practice the open strategy of " going out into the world , " make positive , rational , and effective use of foreign investment , and truly shift the focus of using foreign investment to importing advanced technology , modern management , and specialized talent , so as to spur the restructuring of the domestic economy .

In this connection , I suggest removing provincial civil aviation administrative bodies and putting into practice a model of vertical administration of the regions by the state , establishing a unified system of air regulation in civil aviation , and strengthening investment in air control systems and insofar as possible adopting the world 's most advanced air control techniques and equipment .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
In front of the Zhongxing Communications stall , the general secretary had his attention attracted by a conference television system developed and produced by the company .  He carefully examined the product and inquired about development , production , and market in a detailed manner .

After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .

In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
Deng Xiaoping advanced the theory on the implementation of the open policy in socialist states and took the open policy as a basic national policy on China 's socialist construction .  To gain advantages comparable with that of capitalism , Deng noted , socialism should boldly absorb and use all civilized achievements created by human society , including developed capitalist states ' advanced operational and managerial approaches that reflect the law of modern socialized production .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
The " three represents " show that on the three questions that determine our party 's historical status and role , our party 's program , line , principles , and policies have conformed to the laws of social development and adapted to the tide of the advance of the times .

As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
Through international cooperation the Chinese science and technology community has extensively learned advanced scientific research theory and management methods , enhanced its research and development capabilities , and improved engineering and product quality . and has also gained good economic and social returns ; at the same time , they have also made their own contributions to the development of modern science .  
Reportedly , during his inspection tour to the south last February , Jiang Zemin pointed out the need to keep the CPC " a faithful representative of the requirements in the development of advanced productive forces in China , the orientation of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people in China . " This was later called the " three represents . "  As it was not a " comprehensive exposition , " it was not noticed at that time .  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
We must - - from the high planes of promoting the development of the social productive forces , advancing the development of the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " three represents " - - seize the opportunity and take advantage of the favorable situation to forge ahead and spare no effort in creating a new situation in anti-narcotics work to make fresh , even greater contributions to completely prohibiting narcotics .

Water-efficient irrigation should be turned into peasants ' conscious behavior under the market economic conditions as soon as possible through the provision of advanced , applicable , and cheap facilities and satisfactory after-sale technical service to peasants , so as to form a macroclimate of economizing on water among the entire people .  
Luo Gan pointed out : In independently exercising judicial authority according to law , people 's courts should endeavor to ensure judicial fairness and provide expeditious and effective judicial guarantee and legal service for helping develop the advanced productive forces , protecting the advanced culture , and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .  Judicial fairness is related to the building of a socialist country ruled by the law and to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Endeavoring to represent demand of development of advanced productive forces is a solemn mission and sacred responsibility of our party .

They should consistently maintain the party 's progressiveness and provide a strong political and organizational assurance for our socialist modernization drive .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
When we interviewed some party 's theoretical workers in the capital and other places , they all expressed the same understanding with different languages , pointing out that history and the people have chosen the CPC because it represents the advanced social productive forces , the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the great majority of the people since it was founded .

The water-delivery canal for the east-line project is located in China 's eastern region where the economy is more advanced , township and town enterprises are better developed , and urbanization level is higher .  Thanks to the region 's efforts in recent several years , evident results have been attained in pollution control in the region .  However , the water samples taken from certain river sections in the region still fall below the standard of Class III required for water diversion .  
We should use the information net and other advanced technological means to enhance the level of market management and take further advantage of the competitive strong points of commodity markets , while focusing on cultivating and developing markets for key elements such as capital , technology , and labor , so as to promote the rational flow of the key elements of production .

In the new century , international competition will get more and more intense , the reform and construction tasks at home will also be heavy and arduous .  The objective conditions are continuously changing .  If we do not emancipate our minds , do not carry out innovations , then our cause will not be advanced further , and we will not able to meet various challenges .  
The advanced character of the party should be eventually reflected from each party member 's specific words and deeds .  Only when each party member and cadre are strict with themselves , always place themselves under the supervision of party organizations and the masses , keep tempering and cultivating themselves in party spirit , raise their political consciousness and moral standards , and maintain strict standards in work , daily life , and social intercourse will they be able to ward off the corrosive influence and never become corrupt .  
Therefore , whether to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan or to expand Sino-U.S . bilateral trade , whether to condemn China for suppressing human rights or to obstruct China from acceding to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) - - all such means are used to achieve one objective , that is , to change the current social system in China . The United States ' national interests can be satisfied to the maximum only by achieving this objective .  
They dished out the so-called strategy of " fighting a decisive battle offshore , " purchased advanced weapons and equipment from abroad without restraint , conducted military exercises directed at the mainland of the motherland in an attempt to increase their capacity of " rejecting reunification through armed force .

The people who inhabited South China from prehistoric times were the Nanyue people .  From the Qin and Han dynasties , the Han people of Central China migrated to the south , bringing with advanced culture and technology .  In the Tang and Song dynasties , the Pearl River Delta was developed and migrants multiplied in numbers .  In the Ming and Qing dynasties , more clans moved to Hong Kong and gave this small island a significant economic boost .  
On the government side , major steps have been taken in recent years to welcome filmmakers , whether home-grown , foreign , or returning from abroad .

Medical knowledge is easy to obtain and medical techniques are advanced . Pregnant women are given complete prenatal care , and their babies ' safe births are almost assured . Cases of dystocia and stillbirth are now rare . The average length and weight of the newborn infants have increased .  
At the meeting , foreign guests discovered that the quality of Taiwan 's medicine had improved rapidly over the past 30 years . The death rate has declined and the average life expectancy has increased . This period has seen the eradication of most acute infectious diseases . Medical techniques and knowledge have advanced to such a degree that Taiwan may be considered equal to developed countries .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
Then , she grafts skin implants over the stitched wounds so that the patient 's physical appearance is not impaired . After undergoing extensive advanced training in Japan and the U . S . , last year she temporarily joined the Chinese-Saudi medical team at the Jeddah General Hospital in Saudi Arabia . At first , patients were suspicious over the idea of a woman performing such important work .  
A New , Clean Deal for Taiwan Rapid industrialization in Taiwan has brought with it the inevitable bane of advanced countries everywhere - - pollution . Improved living standards associated with the economic advance have made matters worse by increasing the number of motor vehicles .  
As society has advanced , we have become more industrialized and urbanized . One consequence is that life has become more rushed , more hectic ; a slow , relaxing meal has become a luxury and " fast foods " have become all too common . In this " fast food society " , processed foods have gradually become a housewife 's best friend ; canned foods , frozen foods , and T . V . dinners are now found in almost every kitchen .  
If we do not push hard for advanced development , how can we compete with other industrial countries ? For people who assumed nature 's resources to be infinite , the energy crunch of the 1970 ' s was a rude awakening , an indication of impending environmental crises stemming from careless spoiling and waste of natural resources .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
At the Mandarin Training Center at National Taiwan Normal University , for example , beginning students concentrate on pronunciation and daily conversation , and the main texts used include the elementary school textbooks used in the ROC and picture stories . Intermediate students use Chinese history . Some students also study the Chinese literature textbooks used in middle schools , newspaper prime and radio plays . The scope of advanced classes is broader , and students may choose materials that are appropriate to their level of proficiency and that are related to their research and interests .  
Generally , after the rise of a middle class , a society 's expectations of its government are raised , so that the public of an advanced democratic nation is often evenly divided in its satisfaction with government performance , and a seventy or eighty percent satisfaction rate like some of ours is no longer easily attained .  
The time-honored idea that while counterfeits may be illegal , imitations are harmless , combined with today 's advanced technology , has resulted in a confusing jumble of the spurious and the authentic . Distinguishing the genuine from the fake is a problem of prime importance for collectors and investors in Chinese art . "  
The call for monetary internationalization has been loud and clear recently . It has also become the vogue of our times . After World War , as international investment and international trade expanded , the international money market also experienced rapid development . Banks from various economically advanced nations established branches in foreign countries one after another , thus becoming a part of the close-knit international money market network .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
The technology involved in making optical fiber cables is rather developed and can be employed commercially on a mass production basis , but scientists are still hard at work day and night working to create a highly advanced technology for the future . (  
In order to maintain rapid economic growth , spur social advancement , develop manpower resources , further culture and understanding , and join the ranks of the advanced nations , the ROC must actively carry out educational reform and promote the concept of lifelong education , spurring the nation and its people to a new educational level .  
By the end of this century , we must establish a complete system of laws and regulations , develop a hi-tech industrial structure , fill the gaps in modernized public facilities , carry out well-planned social security and welfare policies , and at the same time expand our particiaption in international activities . If we succeed in doing this , there is no doubt that we will create an advanced , prosperous , healthy , happy , and more balanced society in Taiwan by the year 2000 . ( ed . by Sinorama / photos by Arthur Cheng )  
In the process of economic development , the government should actively invest more in social welfare , and should , based on the particular circumstances of our country , learn from the experiences of more advanced countries and design a concrete program for the welfare of all the people , so that our citizens can live and work in safety and harmony , and the aged , weak , and handicapped can receive the care they need .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
Taiwan 's air force is small but prickly , you 'd better not touch it or you 'll hurt yourself , " says Sherman Cheng . Taiwan 's past air combat record , and ROC pilots ' recent success in beating advanced F-15 fighters with their F-5Es while on training abroad , have forged an impression among the international air force community that Taiwan 's air force is skilled , capable and not to be underestimated .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system . He also suggests establishing " half-open system hospitals , " along the American model , which specialize in offering equipment and locales for use by licensed physicians .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print .

In leading our army 's modernization , Comrade Jiang Zemin is applying Mao Zedong 's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping 's army-building thinking for the new period while adopting some new practices .  He has put forward the task of " ideological and political education " which is of great importance and epochal significance , emphasized the necessity to put ideological and political education above all else in the army , discussed in many ways how to strengthen ideological and political education , and advanced a series of important thinking .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
With the introduction of modern information technology and with some units hit by an " online craze " , there arises the problem of " deviation " in the content of the ideological and political education , that is , neglect in employing advanced methods to conduct basic indoctrination of basic theories , and unsystematic , incomplete , and even fragmentary expounding of basic principles related to enhance convictions and to conduct oneself .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .

For instance , it used for the first time the simulated environmental technology for airforce reconnaissance and monitoring and the most advanced long-range air to surface monitoring system installed in E-8C airborne early warning aircraft to provide target data to the exercising troops , thus greatly improving the simulation effects of a computerized battlefield .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate , and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of firepower warfare and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered with by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war with firepower warfare .  
It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
Only if the Party becomes the requirement for the development of China 's advanced socialist productive force , the forward direction for China 's advanced culture , and the true representative for the basic interests of China 's masses can the Party forever remain in an invincible position , forever have the heartfelt support of each of the country 's nationalities , and continually move forward .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , as a result of the new cultural movement and the Russian October Revolution , a group of patriotic and progressive intellectuals accepted Marxist theory which represented advanced culture and a forward direction .  They penetrated the industrial working masses that represented the advanced productive force , propagated revolutionary theory , and combined the two .  The result was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
All ideological and cultural battlefields , all departments of publicity , culture and education , and all spiritual and cultural products at levels ranging from high to low , should facilitate the spread of advanced culture , publicize scientific theories and mold beautiful souls .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .

After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .

Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
We should use advanced and highly effective information warfare to support long-range , accurate and highly effective firepower , and use flexibility and fast mobility to raise the ability of fighting with firepower and evade the enemy 's firepower .  We must not be interfered by the seething public opinion on the effectiveness of information warfare and high mobility , and must not be delayed in having the whole army advance along the main line and make preparations for winning a war by fighting with firepower .  
According to CMB , the " collective and numerical weather forecast system " , which was built using the " Shenwei " Computer , was a major key project in the state 's " Ninth Five-Year Plan " .

At present , the institute is still working on a more advanced dynamic orientation system , which could help maintain orientation in various directions with a power device and enable a rescue vessel to quickly link up with a target vessel even when there is rushing current deep in the sea ;  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
The progress of the socialist materialist civilization and spiritual civilization has been constantly cleansing the outdated ideas and concepts and the advanced ideological and cultural mentalities like independent mentality , innovative mentality , competitive mentality , open-up mentality , and so on as well as those civilized and progressive social concepts like efficiency concept , effectiveness concepts , and so on which can promote the development of social productive forces have gradually gone deeply into the hearts of the people .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .

To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
High-quality military professionals need to be cultivated through military training through science and technology , military professionals need to master high-tech armament through this training , the highly efficient personnel quota system needs to be tested and completed through this training , and advanced military theories need to be innovated and developed through this training .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .

Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .  
The fact that our party has put forward the need to serve as a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and taken the realization , development , and safeguarding of the people 's fundamental interests as the ultimate aim of all its political activities fully demonstrates the organic integration of the party 's advanced nature with the extensive nature of the masses .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Some British intelligence experts believe that due to such an " unexpected windfall , " the Chinese Communists ' electronic experts will be able to learn about the US forces ' reconnaissance system , counter-reconnaissance system , confrontation system , as well as other relevant technologies in a more comprehensive and in-depth way , or at least be able to broaden their mind or accumulate advance understanding about some weapons after studying the most advanced reconnaissance equipment in modern times .  
It is precisely at this crucial moment that Comrade Jiang Zemin made the remark that the Communist Party of China must represent the progressive course of China 's advanced culture .  He has enriched the political connotation conducive to raising the people 's living standards , and turned the reconstruction of the mode of cultural life and the expansion of advanced culture into the process of China 's modernization drive .  As a result , he has provided China with more attractive cultural resources .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .

Participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has let the basic demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the party and enabling it to always serve as a strong leadership core in building socialism with Chinese characteristics run through the theories and practice of building the ruling party , and clearly put forward a series of important new requirements for the party to strengthen itself in the new century .  
He Yong : In recent years , under the unified leadership of party committees and governments , discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels cooperated closely with other relevant departments , adopted effectively measures , seriously implement the established policies , steadily advanced the work of removing roots causes of corruption in some key fields , properly settled some issues that aroused strong discontent among the masses over many years , and also provided useful experience for our work in the next step .  
Being a theoretical breakthrough for the CPC , the important thinking of " three represents " has summed up the history , taken account of the realities , analyzed a situation at home and abroad , with stress on the former , and has fundamentally enshrined the flesh and blood ties between the CPC and the broad masses of the people , thus bringing to light what the people desire and need , and how the CPC should keep its advanced nature unchanged . 
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .  
It is necessary to inherit and carry forward all good cultures , including the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , the revolutionary cultural tradition formed by the party and the people over a long time , and all advanced civilization achievements created by human society , and strive to develop our national and scientific socialist culture oriented to modernization , to the world , and to the future .  
with all kinds of favorable conditions , including economic conditions , the situation is excellent .  We must seize the opportunity , move forward accordingly , revolve round the center , serve the overall situation , integrate the rule of virtue with the rule of law , integrate demands of advanced nature with demands of widespread nature , and integrate propaganda and education with the building of a sound system and the exercise of stronger management .  
Shi Zhongquan , deputy director of the CPC Central Party History Research Center , said : The important concept of " three represents " was put forward to strengthen our party ideologically , to make large numbers of party cadres , especially the leading cadres , keep firmly in mind the nature and purpose of the party , to keep improving the political , ideological , theoretical , scientific , cultural , and other qualities of the party , and to always preserve and carry forward the its advanced nature .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
base ourselves on the realities in China , with attention focused on the front line of world scientific and cultural development ; and unceasingly develop a healthy , progressive , rich , and colorful socialist culture with Chinese style and characteristics .  That is also the fundamental expression and requirement for our party to remain in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
To study the " speech , " we should hold high the advance banner of China 's advanced culture , strive to create and carry forward a new culture that embodies the requirements of revolution , construction , and reform , satisfy the growing needs of the masses of the people for spiritual culture , and push forward the development and progress of socialist society in a comprehensive way .  
To constantly develop advanced productive forces and culture is , in the final analysis , aimed at meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the people and continuously realizing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people . "  
The cadre center of the city military sub-district has exploited its advantage of having many politically steadfast veteran cadres and organized and sent its personnel to veteran cadres ' activity centers in urban and rural areas and to neighborhoods to publicize and explain the thinking of " three-represents , " and to encourage veteran cadres to advocate advanced culture .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Military schools and academies and military scientific research institutes should use their favorable conditions to pass scientific knowledge to the people in poor areas , transfer scientific and technological achievements to production , spread the use of advanced techniques , help the masses to master science and technology and thus build up their ability to develop the economy .  
As long as our party always faithfully represents the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces , the advance development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people , our party will be able to establish itself in an unassailable position forever , win the wholehearted support of the people of all nationalities throughout China forever , and lead the people to forge ahead ceaselessly .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
Vice-Principal Feng Guoqiang of the Party school of the Shangxi provincial Party committee said that the thinking of " three represents " precisely grasps the three most fundamental and decisive factors about social order , most clearly reflects the advanced nature of our Party , brings to light the content of our Party 's advanced nature , and answers the issue of how to maintain the advanced nature of our Party from an ideological point of view .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
Representing the progressive course of the advanced culture is also a very realistic need .  So it is very urgent to improve the scientific and cultural qualities of peasants ; the quality of the people as a whole can be improved only when the peasants ' quality is improved .  
In light of the ongoing " three stresses " education activities , Chen Gang , chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the Dongbei Pharmaceutical Group , said : In the past few years , the Pharmaceutical Group , proceeding from the requirement of representing advanced social productive forces , renovated its structure and management and accelerated the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  In this way , the company was able to re-emerge from the brink of bankruptcy and to return to the road of rapid growth .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
Watching the exhibits , Ding Guangen praised the success of the exhibition .  He expressed the hope that the entire society would devote more efforts to building spiritual civilization , give wide publicity to scientific theories , disseminate the advanced culture , cultivate an elevated mind , carry forward justice , popularize scientific knowledge , advocate the scientific spirit , eradicate the soil that engenders " Falungong " and all other decadent ideologies and cultures , and make it a social practice to oppose cults and promote civilization .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
This term , the most conscientious and advanced elements , applies to that portion of people who are proficient in scientific Marxist theory , who understand the law of social development , who define their historical mission , and who represent the basic interests of the overwhelming majority of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
With the development of reforms , opening-up and the modernization drive , the working class , including intellectuals , in China has expanded steadily , the quality of the working class has improved markedly in terms of the ideological and moral standard and the scientific and cultural level , a large group of conscientious , advanced elements within the working class has been accepted by the Party , and the class foundation of our Party has increased markedly .  
We should never rush headlong into mass action without first understanding these questions and we should never open the doors of Party organizations without holding those members of the new social strata who do not meet the requirements of membership and are erroneously recruited into the Party to a high standard of review or let them infringe on the Party 's nature as one of the vanguard of the working class and or pollute the advanced nature of our Party .  
To increase the rapid response capability of the base for accidental events on the sea , the base 's logistics leaders and units have vigorously developed the maritime emergency support services .  They have organized emergency support subunits out of defense logistics , arms and equipment , and military supply departments .  They have equipped them with light and advanced logistic facilities as well as conducted special training for them so that they can promptly provide maritime logistical support on receipt of an order .  
The US military has also assisted the Army to establish an " electronic warfare battalion " in secret .  It has leased all the necessary electronic warfare equipment and delivered to the Army a set of mobile equipment , which is the most advanced equipment in service .  The US military plans to deliver five sets of such equipment to Taiwan .  
This is evidenced by , among other things , its increasingly rapid economic growth , significant improvement of its people 's living standards , remarkable achievements in its building of advanced socialist culture and ethics , and vigorous development of all its social undertakings .  
They have procured most advanced radar equipment at home and equipped themselves with some first-rate international-level advanced radar equipment capable of making automatic adjusted target detection , extraction of radar information , and target tracking .  The equipment is all solid-state , with self-detection and micro processing capability .  Their outstanding features lie in high anti-interference capability and in being adapted to making up for the deficiency in the low-attitude blind spot in the air defense system .  
On the one hand , we should seize the present favorable opportunities to speed up the technical transformation of our traditional industries , the renewal of our products , and the upgrading of our industries , through digesting and introducing advanced technologies from foreign countries .  On the other hand , we must also base our efforts on our existing domestic resources ;  
adopt multiple forms , utilize foreign capital in an active , rational , and effective way , pay greater attention to importing advanced technology , modern management , and people with professional skills while absorbing foreign capital ;  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
Fourthly , while shoddy commodities are exposed , it is also necessary to publish and inform the public of the results of tests performed on quality commodities , to support the good and eliminate the bad , let the proper prevail over the improper , protect and support the development of advanced productive forces , and make counterfeit and shoddy commodities unable to find a foothold in the market . 
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
It also has a bearing on the rise or fall of the Chinese nation .  It will also determine whether or not our army can always become the effective tool to fulfill the Party 's political tasks under the new situation .  Therefore , to continuously arm our army with military equipment of advanced technology , enhance our army 's fighting power , and fulfill the Party 's highest political requirements in " fighting to win " should be our army 's basic task in upholding the Party 's absolute leadership over the army under the new situation .  
Over 60 qualified military and technical personnel and 34 university students who were from the current term entered the base and settled down , while scores of directing and dispatching personnel pursued advanced studies in colleges and institutes .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .  
At present , whether or not the public security organs at various levels can protect advanced social productive forces according to law , protect and develop the advanced socialist culture , or protect , develop , and realize the fundamental interests of the broadest public depends crucially on whether or not we can carry through to the end the campaign of rectifying and improving public order , i.e . , " stern crackdown , " spearheaded by " crackdown on underworld forces and eradication of vicious forces . "  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
In light of tactical requirements , the group army made comprehensive use of the technical achievements , and used advanced technical achievements as powerful and effective technical support for implementation of the tactics .  The group army enriched the methods of logistical and equipment support , and it promoted development and innovation in patterns of support .  
Second , according to the actual conditions of the enterprises , keep those achieving good business results , close down those failing in business operation , foster and develop advanced productive forces , form new market space , resolutely cut down on surplus production capacity , eliminate backward production capacity .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
However , the development of the railway transportation capacity still can not satisfy the needs in our national economic and social development .  One of the basic needs for us to " represent the requirements of the development of advanced productive forces " is to quicken railway development and to strive to change the current insufficient capacity of railway transportation as soon as possible .  
With high functional density , short lead time , low costs , and other special features , small satellites are extensively applied to mobile communications , resources exploration , forest conflagrations , flooding , and marine monitoring , and yield social and economic benefits , becoming an important industry for countries with advanced aerospace technology .  
and attempted to sever the kinship forged with blood , which is thicker than water , between the people on two sides .  As if that is not enough , the Taiwan authorities have time and time again spent the hard-earned money of the general public in buying advanced weapons from abroad .  They advocate " fighting a decisive battle outside our borders " and wish to enter into a military alliance with the United States and Japan against the mainland .  
This has been proven by practice of fundamental , universal , long duration , great importance , which has a bearing on the long-term development of the party 's cause .  Only when this issue is solved properly , can our party always retain its advanced and revolutionary nature and creativity and can it establish itself in an unassailable position .  
Meanwhile , the city should also vigorously improve its investment environment , enhance both the quality and efficiency of its foreign fund utilization , and gradually meet the requirement of ensuring a simultaneous growth between its introduction of capital and its introduction of advanced technologies , modern management concepts , and people with professional skills .  
Li Lanqing pointed out : Although the objectives of the state-owned enterprises ' ridding themselves of difficulties within three years have been basically achieved yet , taken as a whole , a considerable gap still exists in such areas as changing concept , carrying out reform and innovation , making technological progress , protecting environment , intensifying management , raising quality , and catching up with and surpassing the world 's advanced levels .  
Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
Moreover , the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly used the money earned by onerous toil of the ordinary people to buy advanced weapons from foreign countries , advocated " a decisive battle offshore , " and intended to form a military alliance against the mainland with the United States and Japan .  
The Speech sums up the basic experiences of the CPC over the past 80 years , looks forward to the tremendous tasks and brilliant future in the new century , and profoundly points out that for our party to continue to stand in the forefront of the era and lead the people to advance victoriously , it must , in sum , always represent the development requirements of China 's advanced social forces , the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people .  
create a sound social order environment for economic development ; and protect and promote the development of the advanced productive forces .  We must resolutely wipe out the ugly social phenomena , such as pornography , gambling , and narcotics ; strengthen management of cultural entertainment places and cultural markets ; firmly crack down on illegal and criminal activities using feudal superstition and religion ; enhance people 's sense of the legal system and ethics ;  
At the present stage , the advanced nature of communist party members should naturally find expression in their conscientious study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents , " and find expression in their conscious efforts to plunge themselves into socialist economic , political , and cultural buildings with Chinese characteristics .  
3 .  The " speech " uses the " three represents " important idea to sums up history , analyze reality , and look into the future ; reveals the scientific connotation of representing the requirement of the development of the advanced productive forces , the orientation of the advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , as well as their inherent relationships ; and uses the " three represents " as a guideline to put forward the basic tasks of stepping up and improving party building .  
At the same time , we should continue to practice the open strategy of " going out into the world , " make positive , rational , and effective use of foreign investment , and truly shift the focus of using foreign investment to importing advanced technology , modern management , and specialized talent , so as to spur the restructuring of the domestic economy .  
The Shuguang 2000-II SuperServer is a major achievement in the State 863 Project and in the knowledge innovation project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .

In this connection , I suggest removing provincial civil aviation administrative bodies and putting into practice a model of vertical administration of the regions by the state , establishing a unified system of air regulation in civil aviation , and strengthening investment in air control systems and insofar as possible adopting the world 's most advanced air control techniques and equipment .  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
In front of the Zhongxing Communications stall , the general secretary had his attention attracted by a conference television system developed and produced by the company .  He carefully examined the product and inquired about development , production , and market in a detailed manner .  The general secretary smiled approvingly upon hearing that the product had filled a domestic void , reached advanced international standards , broken similar foreign products ' monopoly in China , and been exported to five countries , including Kenya .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
On the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : Taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .  Take its geographical conditions for an example .  Taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high-performance weapons into play .  
Priorities should be given to the construction and development of information infrastructure facilities .  At the time of using existing optical cables to expand basic transmission networks and popularizing basic telecommunications services , the Ministry of Information Industry will exert efforts to develop and use the most advanced communications and information technical findings of the present age ; speed up the pace of building a new generation of high-speed , safe , and reliable public information networks with a nationwide coverage capacity ;  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
After the Cold War , although the United States ' military development has advanced to a level unprecedented in human history , the international rules and international order have remained in effect .  The Americans have not gone all out , like other imperial expansionists we are familiar with in world history , to forcefully establish hegemony based purely on military power similar to the kind we know in history .  
Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .

The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit .

" Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
The tour group had made advanced reservations for soft sleepers from Huhhot City to Peking . Suddenly they were confronted with the news that all of their tickets had been cancelled . Upon inquiring as to the reason , they discovered that the very train they intended to board had been requisitioned by a high ranking official of the communist party ; naturally , none of the soft sleeper cars could fit other passengers .  
In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations . These sought a liberation of images , and declared total war on traditional ink painting and on natural realism . They argued that art must inevitably progress from the concrete to the abstract ; in their view " abstract expressionism , " with only basic shapes and colors , was the only end point of artistic development .  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system . He also suggests establishing " half-open system hospitals , " along the American model , which specialize in offering equipment and locales for use by licensed physicians .  
Today , the urban environment imposes restrictions on dogs , which need space to move . The chance of dogs living a vagrant existence increases greatly in big cities , where garbage piles up but is not easily cleared away , enhancing the chance for abandoned dogs ' survival . This is one of the reasons why impoverished nations have similar amounts of stray dogs as advanced nations .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
This will make it much easier for them to understand the abstract concepts . But if this previous experience is insufficient , or if the students are having trouble with step-by-step logical reasoning-such as understanding that if two sides of triangle are equal , then their corresponding angles are as well-then when they get to analysis required in more advanced geometry , they 're going to have trouble , " says teacher Lin Chia-jung .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
Many non-flowering aquatic plants propagate through asexual reproduction , which is arguably more efficient than the process employed by terrestrial plants . It is common to think of flowering plants as more advanced , but in Yen 's view , " Maybe plants that can reproduce without going through that process are actually the most advanced from an evolutionary standpoint . "  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
What is more , ST &amp; T 's energy controller has many advanced functions , such as automatic readings and an " intelligent electric meter . " Users can set a monthly energy usage limit that will trigger an alarm when exceeded . Or it can be programmed to remind you that energy appliances such as dryers are best used when the rates are low at night . The user can even install intelligent modules on separate electrical devices and conveniently and precisely control the energy use of each .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time . Meanwhile , unemployed workers are stuck in a trap and require basic assistance . The government has already implemented an advanced national unemployment policy that has turned from the passive stance of giving unemployment assistance to an active stance of providing employment services and professional training , government job creation , and helping workers change occupations .  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
But the downside of having conquered these illnesses is that the number of patients is constantly falling , so most young doctors prefer to specialize in growth fields like illnesses of advanced industrial societies or problems of the elderly . Virology , bacteriology , and epidemiology are considered " sunset subjects . " The result is that there has been no one to take the baton from the previous generation , and gatherings of specialists in these fields can be mistaken for meetings of a senior citizens group .  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
The data collected by low-elevation weather stations lacks detailed information on high altitude cloud cover and air current changes , among other things . Although it is now possible to use satellite technology , high-altitude weather balloons and other advanced technology to measure the temperature , air pressure and humidity at high altitudes , the collection of data on such things as visibility , cloud type and cloud height depends on visual observation and can not be achieved by automated instruments .

The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
Certainly , the logic of evolution and the rules of transformation indicate that the stages of change carry within them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry , unless an objective and conducive environment exists , accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of highly advanced values that are crystallized through coordinated and concerted efforts . 
As we have indicated , three of them are out of service for lack of essential spare parts , which are supposed to be exempt from the provisions of resolution 748 ( 1992 ) for humanitarian reasons , and because of their advanced age and constant need of maintenance . inclement weather .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .

The Office has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained among the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator , as a well-tested and flexible formula for ensuring a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
While disseminating information about the Court through traditional methods is to be welcomed and further encouraged , my delegation believes that the use of advanced technology in enhancing public awareness about the Court and its activities should be improved .  To this end , we express strong support for the steps taken by the Court to take advantage of the benefits provided by the electronic media , such as the Internet , and in particular the construction of its own website , which should facilitate public access to the Court 's voluminous documents .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
In addition , these factors illustrate the need to exploit the potentially mutually supportive role of the public and private sectors and the importance of the current work under GATS on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .  12 .  Trade in the health service sector also demonstrates the extremely vulnerable position of poorer , especially least developed countries , which on the one hand suffer from a " brain drain " and on the other do not have access to advanced technologies .  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
While there is not yet a universally accepted definition of terrorism _ academics and experts tending to approach the phenomenon from varying perspectives , and Governments tending to label as acts of terrorism manifestations of the phenomenon which directly affect their own interests while remaining unconcerned about the emergencies of others _ admittedly , one of the major difficulties standing in the way of consensus has been the continuing controversy about wars of national liberation and the motives advanced to justify violence .  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
The joint scientific research programme conducted during the 21st expedition included experiments relating to the vital functions of the human organism , microgravity , basic biological research , advanced technologies and Earth sciences .  
UNHCR has advanced the view that the lead agency model should be retained , amongst the options available to the Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator ( ERC ) as a well tested and flexible formula for ensuing a coordinated response to complex emergencies .  In the view of UNHCR , the lead agency approach has the advantage of avoiding multiple layers of coordination , minimizing cost and avoiding diffused accountability .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .
