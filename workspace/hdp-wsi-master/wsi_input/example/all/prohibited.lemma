Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .

On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .

Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .

" The presumption is reasonable because illicit fuel usually has a sulphur content higher than 0.05% by weight whereas light diesel oil from legitimate sources on which duty has been paid must have a sulphur content at or below 0.05% .

Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .

The systematic efforts to annihilate 20-million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments , which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction , since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima , which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights .

On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .
