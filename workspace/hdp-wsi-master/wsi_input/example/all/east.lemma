When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
From October to April , during the season of northeast rains , on the east and north coasts of Green Island the typical scene is of stormy seas , dark reefs and waves chipping away at the cliff walls . At this time the soft coral dwindles and large fish that move in giant schools grow in number . On the slopes of the reef , you can see fierce jackfish and sharks that grow nearly a meter long cruising about slowly . It 's dangerous and exciting .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
A 19th century English naturalist , exploring the clear waters and sharp cliffs , recorded the stunning impression these imposing precipices by the sea made on him : " The Portuguese must have first seen this island from the north or the south , for if they had seen it from the east , they would not have chosen a word as mundane as ' beautiful ' to describe it . "  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight .

But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below .

"  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead .

For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia .

All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish .

In contrast , Bush gives people an impression of being cordial and honest , even though he is not as eloquent and analytical as Gore . Americans treasure honesty more than anything else , and they are willing to elect an honest and reliable President instead of an able but not trustworthy one .  This is why , with the exception of those in the east and west coasts and in some large cities , most people have cast their votes to Bush .  
At present , China 's sandy-soil area comes to 1.689 million square kilometers , accounting for 17.6% of the territory in China and forming a sandstorm belt starting in the Tarim Basin in the west and extending to the western part of the Songnen plain in the east .  It runs 4500 kilometers from east to west , and 600 kilometers from north to south .  
While avoiding project duplication and prohibiting the transfer of backward technology and without causing environmental pollution , we shall take strong measures in a number of areas including investment , budgeting , taxation , credit , trade , industry and commerce , labor , and statistics to support enterprises in east and central China in pursuing cooperation with the west by investing in and building factories in the west , buying shares in western enterprises , acquiring or merging with western enterprises , and transferring technology to western enterprises .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
The Golan Heights has an area of 1,860 square km .  It is situated in southwestern Syria and adjacent to Lebanon , Israel , and Jordan . Its terrain is dangerously steep .  It overlooks the Galilee Valley of Israel to the west and guards the passageway into Damascus to the east .  With an abundant water supply , the heights ' strategic position is very important .  
CPPCC Member Zhang Chunyuan answered a reporter 's question concerning the planning of this south-to-north water diversion project : Basing on their studies and verifications over the past 50 years , departments in charge of water conservancy have decided on a water diversion plan by which water will be diverted from the south to the north of China along three lines , namely , the east , the central , and the west lines , with a total water diversion volume of 38-40 billion cubic meters .  
The south-to-north water diversion project will be linked up with the Chang Jiang , the Huai He , the Huang He , and the Hai He , thus giving shape to the country 's overall water resources network characterized by " four horizontal and three vertical waterlines , water diversion from the south to the north , and mutual relief between the east and the west . "  
It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
We should persist in taking accelerated development as the main theme , bring into full play our advantages , such as good location , scientific and educational strengths , and rich natural resources , and , on the basis of the sound development scored in the Ninth Five-Year Plan , strive to increase our overall strength , narrow our gap with east China , quickly raise the people 's income , and ease the employment pressure .  
Fifth , quicken the transformation of roads , give priority to the construction of express highways , build up major transportation lines across the central plain , and turn Henan a major transportation hub between the north and the south and between the east and the west .  
The area is bounded by Argyle Street to the north , Portland Street to the east , Shantung Street to the south and Reclamation Street to the west .  It will be for the commercial / office / hotel development incorporating a public open space , a neighbourhood community centre , a cooked food centre and a public light bus terminus .  
While your visit on this occasion is all too short , I hope that in the brief time available you can get an appreciation of what Hong Kong is today - a city that 's proud to be reunited with China , a city confidently moving ahead to overcome the fallout from the Asian financial turmoil , and a hard-working people , like the Dutch , who have fashioned a dynamic environment which successfully blends the cultures of the east and the west . 
The weather was fine and sunny on April 13 but it became cloudy with some light rain patches again that evening as an intense replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the south China coastal areas .  Winds strengthened from the east and persisted the next day .  
Another key success that we have had in applying EIA was the abandonment of a project which proposed the excavation of 400 million cubic metres of fill material from Mirs Bay to the east of Hong Kong : one of the most pristine , valuable marine ecosystems left in Hong Kong . EIA has saved it from destruction and preserved it for present and future generations to enjoy . 
The Planning Scheme Area covering about 193 hectares is located in the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula . It is bounded by the Victoria Harbour to the south , southwest and southeast ; Jordan Road and Gascoigne Road to the north ; and Hung Hom Bay Reclamation to the east .  
" From 7 pm to 9 pm , the extent of the traffic ban will be enlarged to cover all central harbour .  Vessels , other than excepted vessels , will be prohibited from entering or remaining in the Restricted Area , which is bounded on the east by a line joining Hung Hom Railway Station Cargo Pier and the breakwater at Kellett Island of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club , and on the west by a line joining the southwest extremity of the Ocean Terminal and the Central Government Pier .  
Costing about NT $ 7.3 billion ( US $ 203 million ) and taking six years to construct , the railway was fully opened to traffic on Feb . 1 , 1980 . Traversing the mountainous region along the northeast coast of Taiwan , from Nanshenghu in Ilan County in the north to Tienpu in Hualien County in the south , the railway is part of the planned round-the-island system . It will play a major role in boosting the economy and tourism on the under-developed east coast of Taiwan as well as strengthening national defense .  
They asked her to raise her left hand if she wanted to marry the rich and ugly son living to the east , and to raise her right hand if she wanted to marry the handsome , but poor son living to the west .  
These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China . This period which is recorded in the classic annals of " the Spring and Autumn " ( 722-484 BC ) saw China divided up into rival kingdoms , each with their own written language .  
Located in the southern portion of Nant'ou County , Chushan is bordered on the east by Luku Township and to the south by Yunlin County 's Kuk'eng . The natural topography of the area has helped to shape Chushan 's unique character . The rugged , majestic peaks of the Central Mountain Range bisect the area and two sparkling rivers , the Ch'ing Shui Hsi and the Cho Shui Hsi meander through its borders .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
The excited archeologists discovered that this trail was part of a lengthy road that traversed the central mountain range from the Chushan area in the west , to Yuli , near Hualien in the east . The total distance the trail covered was 120 kilometers . Known as Pat'ungkung in the native aboriginal dialect , the road was constructed during the reign of the Ching dynasty emperor Kuang Hsu ( also known as Teh Tsung , 1875-1908 ) .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "  
One hundred years ago , Taipei was surrounded by a sturdy protective wall . The wall , completed in three years , was square , and had four gates , one in the north , south , east , and west . There was also another small gate on the southern side .  
According to the R . O . C . Tourism Society , geologic conditions in the west are not as favorable to the formation of gorges as in the east ; nevertheless , Matala has been especially favored by nature , and its waterfalls , caves , small lakes and other countless scenic wonders ( extremely reminiscent of Taroko Gorge in Hualien ) are a playground for the adventurous .  
In fact , flowers or " sacrifices , " aside from differences in religious connotation , both contain a single heartfelt meaning . And using animals as offerings has been known in both east and west ; in China , they also carry thousands of years of unbroken tradition and symbolic meaning .  
Orchid Island is located about 49 nautical miles east of the city of Taitung . With education relatively late and travel inconvenient , much traditional culture and thinking is preserved .  
According to a survey done twenty years ago , the University of Chicago ranked third among American colleges and universities , enjoying a lofty academic reputation and battling it out for number one as a worthy representative for the Midwest against Harvard on the east coast and Stanford in the west .  
Malawi is located in southeast Africa , bordering on Zambia to the west , Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the east and south . It has an area of 118,500 square kilometers , one fifth of which is covered by lakes .  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
Another Ching map of Taiwan is one of the few imperial maps to use-longitude and latitude , albeit with latitude zeroed at the North Pole , and longitude measured in degrees east of Peking . The prime meridian passes through the observatory there rather than in Greenwich , which in Hung Min-lin 's view makes plain where the Ching felt the center of the universe lay .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
Submarines lose some of their superiority in the relatively shallow Taiwan Straits , where sea trenches are not wide enough for use , and military experts believe there can be at the most only thirteen mainland submarines deployed around Taiwan , to the north , east , south and southwest where the waters are deeper .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Offshore to the east lies the longest coral reef in the western hemisphere . Most of the mountains are covered with dense primeval forests , home to more than 500 species of birds and thousands of varieties of butterflies . There are sanctuaries for jaguars and baboons and some 600 sites of the ancient Mayan civilization , making Belize a paradise for naturalists and anthropologists alike .  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .  
You can find an oceanic current running by the islet on the east and west sides , the Kuroshio , which is a warm current from the equator . This comfortable and clear sea water has spawned a rich and beautiful foundation of ocean resources for Green Island .  
The road is named after the Chinese hero Tran Hung-dao , who led the Vietnamese in resistance against the invading Mongol armies of the Yuan dynasty in the fourteenth century . To the east of the road is the Vietnamese political and economic center ( now the first and third districts ) , while to the west is Tan An ( the fifth and sixth districts ) .  
Measurements show that it was an irregularly shaped rectangle , about 430 meters wide east to west and 540 meters long north to south . The area of the city was about 200,000 square meters . Archaeologists have even discovered remnants of city walls built to a height of six or seven meters . This dirt wall is from 4000 years before our time .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .  
The main ceremonies of the Ami people are the " Sea Festival " held each June and the " Harvest Festival " each July and August . Travelling to the east in January as we did for this article , we missed the opportunity to attend those . But , since a local election is fast approaching , we ran into plenty of county assembly and mayoral hopefuls out trying to build up their name recognition by holding dinners in tents by the side of the road .  
Those who are fed up with urban traffic congestion find that driving the east coast roads is a pleasure . On one side are verdant promontories , and on the other is blue sea . What could be nicer than winding you way through this colorful scenery , especially when there are no red lights along the way !  
Starting in the north at the mouth of the Hualien River , the designated area runs southward as far as Little Yehliu ; on the west it is bounded by the coastal mountain range running north-south parallel to the Central Mountain Range ; and in the east it runs into the Pacific Ocean .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
Tall and slender " Little Cutey " came onto the stage , a heavy cloak draped over her shoulders . Her body wriggled in serpentine motions . Every once in a while , she would unlatch her buttons and , walking toward the east end of the stage , flash open her cloak . Then she would walk toward the west end and flash her cloak open again .  
When I was very little , I often heard some old folks mention a Place called Kuoyeh , on the east shores of Penghu [ the principal island of the Penghuarchipelago , traditionally referred to in English as the Pescadores ] . At dawnwhen the weather is good , one can stand on the east edge of the village and gazing across the distant waters catch a glimpse of the towering mountains of the main island of Taiwan , rising up to the east .  
From October to April , during the season of northeast rains , on the east and north coasts of Green Island the typical scene is of stormy seas , dark reefs and waves chipping away at the cliff walls . At this time the soft coral dwindles and large fish that move in giant schools grow in number . On the slopes of the reef , you can see fierce jackfish and sharks that grow nearly a meter long cruising about slowly . It 's dangerous and exciting .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
A 19th century English naturalist , exploring the clear waters and sharp cliffs , recorded the stunning impression these imposing precipices by the sea made on him : " The Portuguese must have first seen this island from the north or the south , for if they had seen it from the east , they would not have chosen a word as mundane as ' beautiful ' to describe it . "  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important . The single track was turned into a double track , and many of the old single-track tunnels were taken out of service . Now they are objects of our explorations .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below . As he left , the Queen Mother 's parting words to him were : " Though the peaks stand as high as the clouds , you crossed mountains and rivers to come from the distant east ; may you live to be a hundred , and may we meet again . "  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead . Although a museum was established , as a consequence it lost its potential local commemorative significance .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
Colliding tectonic plates thrust sharp , easily eroded mountains up to high elevations from whence heavy rainfall , landslides , and river action carry the mountains back to sea bit by bit . Taiwan 's 151 rivers , which total nearly 3,000 kilometers in length , are a key part of this " wheel of life . " They have carved out some of the world 's most unique gorges in the east , and in the west have deposited the soil that makes up the most productive and beautiful plains on the island .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
" Chelungpu is a classic reverse fault . The east side of the fault was thrust diagonally upwards , and more or less everyone living along that side was killed or injured . But although the west side was subjected to the same violent shaking , most of the buildings remained standing . "  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia . There they settled in places like Adelaide , Bendigo , and Ballarat on the east coast , and in the mountain areas of Queensland state , hoping to fulfill their gold-panning dreams .  
Pinglin is located on the Taipei-Ilan Highway , 38 km east of Taipei , and 42 km west of Ilan . The area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the Fushih Mountains to the north , the Ayu Mountains to the south , and the Peishih River meandering through it . Most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .  
With that experience under his belt , he decided three years ago at the age of 57 that in addition to his full-time job at a trading company , he would get involved in the matchmaking business by helping his wife , the outgoing Chu Li-li , set up " Super Matchmaker-Mama Jan " next door to the Asia Pacific Hotel on Taipei 's east side . The Jan clan uses a traditional one-on-one style of matchmaker-moderated meetings to help eligible young singles find dating partners , hopefully leading to marriage .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
All types of fish that can be eaten raw have a fairly high fat content , but the bluefin is particularly famed for its fattiness . The Pacific bluefin that migrate through the waters east of Taiwan prefer lower water temperatures than other tuna , and usually stay north of the 18th parallel . To protect it from cold the Pacific bluefin has more fat than the yellowfin and albacore , which are distributed around the equator , or the southern bluefin , which lives in the southern hemisphere .  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
From Great Giving Hall , where the medical school is located , one can look west to the verdant Central Mountain Range , east to hanging gardens replete with flowers and trees , and north to Still Thoughts Hall , the spiritual symbol of the Tzu Chi Foundation .  
Back in the days when cities relied on rail transport , train stations were catalysts for commercial development . But thanks to Changhua 's geography , while the nice plain to the east of the station became a thriving commercial and residential area , the western side stayed so quiet you can just about see tumbleweeds roll past .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .
