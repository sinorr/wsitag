In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "

Huang Cheng-hsiung , executive director of World Vision Taiwan , says that people fell over themselves to take in the orphans created by the earthquake , but the elderly got scant help .

On the day of the French defeat , local residents subsequently ordained a ritual so as to pay homage to the ghosts of those who died so far from home .

Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium .

Taiwan has well-trained medical personnel and excellent facilities , but because it was not able to get advice and practical support from the WHO in a timely manner-for example , on preventing hospital transmission and implementing in-hospital prevention measures-much energy has been misspent and the holes created by mistakes have yet to be plugged .

Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level .

When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players .

Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan .

In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .  Today I received a copy of a message sent by the Government of Burundi to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , inviting them to increase the number of human rights observers , since the current Government ,  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .

The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .

The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
While judicial guarantees set out in the now defunct Constitution , according to the Government , do not apply , through correspondence received by the Centre for Human Rights , the former Special Rapporteur had been informed by the Government of Myanmar that those elaborated in the Code of Criminal Procedure applied in all cases heard in civilian courts even when the detention was carried out under a SLORC order or an emergency regulation .  
The situation facing UNRWA in the last quarter of 1996 was untenable because its cash reserves had been depleted , and replenishment could only be effected by immediate payment of pledges already received ; further future deficits could no longer be absorbed because the Agency 's working capital would have been exhausted by the end of 1996 ;

As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
He regretted that the Department had not been more responsive to and supportive of Ukraine 's unprecedented contribution to nuclear disarmament and diminishing the global nuclear threat , which had not received adequate international recognition .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .

National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
Rape continued to be reported as widespread ( perpetrated by members of all parties to the conflict ) and regular reports were received of women being obliged to perform forced labour for military and paramilitary units and groups .

According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .

Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .

Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .

However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .
