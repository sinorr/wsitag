Wu Bangguo emphasized that funds for migrants have a bearing on the migrants ' vital interests , and whether they are used well or badly will have a great impact ; it is imperative to strengthen the management of funds for migrants , make public for compensation standards for the migrants , and take the initiative to accept supervision by the migrant masses ; it is essential to ensure that the funds that should be issued to migrants are sufficiently in place , and ensure the specific use of the specific funds .  
These flowers are not the same as common plants because they move about and they are probably five times the size of ordinary plants - - but common plants are no match for the beauty of these migrant plants which are purple , red , blue , yellow , and green colored suns - - their stalks are pretty girls and they float around rootless like duckweed .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Three aspects of migrant trafficking are particularly troubling to the governments concerned : ( a ) the associated violations of human rights and dignity ; ( b ) the social and economic implications of disorderly immigration ; and ( c ) linkages to organized crime .  
Finally , the study proposes a women 's status index which would integrate maternal mortality , adult literacy and primary and secondary enrolment rate , labour force status , contraceptive use , and migrant female / male wage ratio .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Expressing deep concern about the marginalization of rural women , especially young women with small children , women living in extreme poverty in rural areas and the sexual harassment experienced by , and the violence perpetrated against , them , including those in war-affected areas , as well as about the effect of male migrant workers ,  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Specific measures include the regulation of recruitment agencies ; legal , social and educational outreach to migrant women ; trained female police officers and protection from male officers ; training for embassy personnel ; enforcement of national labour standards for all workers that conform to international guidelines ; better enforcement of existing laws ; involvement of trade unions ; and implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and reporting mandates .  
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .

They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;  
With full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of each country , and within the context of juridical arrangements established with other States , coordinate efforts to combat criminal organizations engaged in migrant trafficking .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The plight of women migrant workers who become victims of physical , mental and sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers , their intermediaries , or the police - a situation exacerbated by economic exploitation - is one that calls for concerted action at the international , national and regional levels .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .

Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
The psychological effects of the Gulf war were still evident during these discussions and considerably complicated the task of approaching and understanding the question of migrant workers and that of the Bidun , who were variously described as undocumented persons , stateless persons and illegal residents . 
Their employees are provided with public transport but not food and , generally speaking , their living conditions are harsh and inhumane , leading one migrant worker to say It 's exploitation ; the living conditions are unbearable , like in a prison .

The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 10 , expressed its deep concern at the growing manifestations of racism , xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment directed against migrant workers in different parts of the world and decided , in view of the scope and seriousness of the problem , to devote close attention to the protection of migrant workers and members of their families at its forty _ ninth session .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
This is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the informal sector of the economies of industrialized migrant-receiving countries and the growing demand for irregular migrant workers who , by definition , constitute an unprotected , docile and easily exploited workforce .  
Another important group of migrants who are exposed to serious human rights abuses are those engaged in the informal economy of the receiving countries , where small and less competitive enterprises , especially in textile , garment-making and various service industries , try to save on social and labour costs by hiring cheap and often irregular migrant workers , increasingly with the help of traffickers .  
Even in countries where general human rights and social legislation is well advanced , the working and living conditions of these migrant workers are often comparable to those of the slave labour conditions prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century .  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,

The Philippine delegation fully supports the various measures under the section on international migration which are directed at protecting and improving the conditions of migrant workers , particularly female migrant workers , who are easily exploited and harassed .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
According to the Committee , there was an increasing tendency to recruit women migrant workers for commercial ( sexual ) exploitation through arranged marriages with foreigners or by getting them to sign contracts of employment that look tempting but rarely reflect the real situation .  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration . 
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly the countries of origin and destination , to further strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,

Strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia as regards access to employment , vocational training , housing , schooling , health services and social services , as well as services intended for use by the public , and welcomes the active role played by governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating racism and assisting individual victims of racist acts , including migrant victims ;  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,

This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .  
Various workshops and round tables on reproductive health rights and a technical symposium on international migration and development which had called special attention to female migrant workers had been held in the context of the five-year review of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development .  
The Turkish Government is concerned that , despite continuing efforts to increase the vigilance of Governments and arouse international public opinion , contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular against Blacks , Muslims and migrant workers , and xenophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance , continue to exist and even grow in magnitude by adopting subtle new forms .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
In chapter IV of the report , the Special Rapporteur describes the general context and discusses the following topics which are of special concern to her : ( a ) situation of irregular migrants ; ( b ) sale of fraudulent documents ; ( c ) situation of migrant women and unaccompanied minors ; ( d ) undocumented children without access to health care and education ; ( e ) broken families ; and ( f ) racism , xenophobia and racial discrimination .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
Note with grave concern that , despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied , evolving and sophisticated contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination , in particular nationals of different origins , migrant workers , asylum-seekers , refugees and foreigners ;  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
ILO Convention No . 97 further provides that migrant workers receive treatment no less favourable than that which is applied to nationals with respect to remuneration ; membership in trade unions and the enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining ; accommodation ; and social security including legal provision regarding employment injury , maternity , sickness , invalidity , old age , death , unemployment and family responsibilities , and any other contingency which , according to national laws or regulations , is covered by a social security scheme .  
ILO Convention No . 143 also provides that States parties pursue a national policy designed to promote and to guarantee equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment , occupation , social security , trade union and cultural rights , and of individual and collective freedoms for persons who as migrant workers or as members of their families are lawfully within its territory .  
We note with regret that certain media circles , by promoting false images , particularly of migrant workers and refugees , have contributed to the spread of xenophobic sentiments among the public and have encouraged violence by racist groups ; 96 .  We recognize the positive contribution the exercise of the right to freedom of expression ,  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
The Board also took into consideration in its selection that the Group had decided to keep under consideration at its twenty-sixth session the question of debt bondage , the role of corruption in the perpetuation of slavery and slavery-like practices , problems affecting migrant workers , the protection of child labourers , forced labour , trafficking in human organs and tissues , forced marriages , ways to combat sexual abuse of children inside the family , and the urgent need for adequate help to be offered to victims of such practices .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
The Assembly made a number of recommendations to Governments and Member States , in particular to countries of origin and destination , calling on them to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States .  
The recommendations called upon Governments to sign and ratify relevant international instruments on migrant workers ; develop bilateral and multilateral agreements with a view to raising awareness and ensuring the protection of the human rights of women migrant workers ; and to provide training to immigration , police and consular officers on the proper handling of cases of violence against women migrant workers .  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information , including the possible establishment of a database for research and analysis , and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
Urges concerned Governments , in particular those of the countries of origin and destination , to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States , and to establish and maintain continuing dialogues to facilitate the exchange of information ;  
To establish the increasingly necessary restrictions on the activities of certain non-State sectors currently acting as they please within the international framework , with a view to making them meet the national and international standards ensuring the protection of the basic rights , including human rights , of the most vulnerable sectors , in particular local workers , indigenous peoples , national or ethnic minorities and migrant workers ;  
To develop policies and action plans , and to reinforce and implement preventive measures , to foster greater harmony and tolerance between migrant workers and host societies with the aim of eliminating the growing manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including acts of violence , perpetrated in many societies by individuals or groups and directed towards migrant workers and their families , persons of migrant origin and resident foreign workers ;  
Wu Bangguo emphasized that funds for migrants have a bearing on the migrants ' vital interests , and whether they are used well or badly will have a great impact ; it is imperative to strengthen the management of funds for migrants , make public for compensation standards for the migrants , and take the initiative to accept supervision by the migrant masses ; it is essential to ensure that the funds that should be issued to migrants are sufficiently in place , and ensure the specific use of the specific funds .  
These flowers are not the same as common plants because they move about and they are probably five times the size of ordinary plants - - but common plants are no match for the beauty of these migrant plants which are purple , red , blue , yellow , and green colored suns - - their stalks are pretty girls and they float around rootless like duckweed .  
The majority are attracted by the numerous broad river estuaries and rich tidal marshes and mud-flats along Taiwan 's west coast , so there are far fewer migrant birds , and of fewer species , on the steeper eastern coast .  
Entrusting the work to a " B team " was less than ideal , and managerial woes were compounded by the vast diversity of China , with its hundreds of millions of people , where any effort by the Taiwanese to impose a standard way of doing things tended to generate discord . " The way it 's done in traditional manufacturing industries in Guangdong province , using migrant workers and applying military-type management techniques , can be effective , " says Grow Lin .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Three aspects of migrant trafficking are particularly troubling to the governments concerned : ( a ) the associated violations of human rights and dignity ; ( b ) the social and economic implications of disorderly immigration ; and ( c ) linkages to organized crime .  
Finally , the study proposes a women 's status index which would integrate maternal mortality , adult literacy and primary and secondary enrolment rate , labour force status , contraceptive use , and migrant female / male wage ratio .  
His Government had repeatedly expressed its opposition to that initiative because it clearly violated the most basic human rights of migrant workers and their families set forth in various international legal instruments .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Expressing deep concern about the marginalization of rural women , especially young women with small children , women living in extreme poverty in rural areas and the sexual harassment experienced by , and the violence perpetrated against , them , including those in war-affected areas , as well as about the effect of male migrant workers ,  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy and numeric problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The Acting Director emphasized that that situation limited the Institute 's capacity to provide the corresponding General Assembly committees with substantive contributions and research findings in critical areas of economic and social development processes , such as : water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , poverty alleviation , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
Specific measures include the regulation of recruitment agencies ; legal , social and educational outreach to migrant women ; trained female police officers and protection from male officers ; training for embassy personnel ; enforcement of national labour standards for all workers that conform to international guidelines ; better enforcement of existing laws ; involvement of trade unions ; and implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and reporting mandates .  
The Working Group also noted that these workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including forcing them to live separately from their spouse and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and strongly condemned practices of unequal treatment of migrant workers and the denial to them of minimum human consideration and dignity .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;  
With full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of each country , and within the context of juridical arrangements established with other States , coordinate efforts to combat criminal organizations engaged in migrant trafficking .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The plight of women migrant workers who become victims of physical , mental and sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers , their intermediaries , or the police - a situation exacerbated by economic exploitation - is one that calls for concerted action at the international , national and regional levels .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
In the United Nations human rights programme of assistance , priority will be given to establishing criteria and implementing procedures for promoting economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , to exploring the root causes of human rights violations , to protecting the rights of persons who can be particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect , including youth , persons with disabilities , the elderly and migrant workers .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
The plight of women migrant workers who become victims of physical , mental and sexual harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers , their intermediaries , or the police - a situation exacerbated by economic exploitation - is one that calls for concerted action at the international , national and regional levels .

Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
countries , migration pressures due to climatic change , the protection of migrant women and children from abuse by their sponsors , the right of receiving countries to regulate access to their territory , the adverse consequences of forced migration , the situation of persons whose asylum claims have been rejected , the trafficking in women and children , prostitution and coercive adoption , and the sudden and massive arrival of refugees and displaced persons in need of international protection .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
The psychological effects of the Gulf war were still evident during these discussions and considerably complicated the task of approaching and understanding the question of migrant workers and that of the Bidun , who were variously described as undocumented persons , stateless persons and illegal residents . 
Their employees are provided with public transport but not food and , generally speaking , their living conditions are harsh and inhumane , leading one migrant worker to say It 's exploitation ; the living conditions are unbearable , like in a prison .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them in the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impedes their upward mobility and further reinforces discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 10 , expressed its deep concern at the growing manifestations of racism , xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment directed against migrant workers in different parts of the world and decided , in view of the scope and seriousness of the problem , to devote close attention to the protection of migrant workers and members of their families at its forty _ ninth session .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
There should also be special attention given to promoting social protection for vulnerable or marginalized groups of women workers , especially international female migrant workers , women in transition economies adversely affected by economic reforms and long-term unemployed older women workers .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
The high level of unemployment of migrant urban female workers , the lack of measures to integrate them into the labour markets and the persistent occupational segregation in lower paid jobs impeded their upward mobility and further reinforced discrimination against women in the labour market .  
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Womens social position , marital status , class , or membership in particularly vulnerable groups , such as refugee or migrant women , rural or urban poor women , are often linked to de facto , and sometimes also to de jure , discrimination .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
This is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the informal sector of the economies of industrialized migrant-receiving countries and the growing demand for irregular migrant workers who , by definition , constitute an unprotected , docile and easily exploited workforce .  
Another important group of migrants who are exposed to serious human rights abuses are those engaged in the informal economy of the receiving countries , where small and less competitive enterprises , especially in textile , garment-making and various service industries , try to save on social and labour costs by hiring cheap and often irregular migrant workers , increasingly with the help of traffickers .  
Even in countries where general human rights and social legislation is well advanced , the working and living conditions of these migrant workers are often comparable to those of the slave labour conditions prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century .  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
The Philippine delegation fully supports the various measures under the section on international migration which are directed at protecting and improving the conditions of migrant workers , particularly female migrant workers , who are easily exploited and harassed .  
The Special Rapporteur calls on all countries with large inflows of immigrants to develop and put into effect programmes to combat harmful traditional practices in accordance with their national laws and international standards , but always with due respect for the cultural values of the migrant population groups and without denigrating their cultures or treating the societies concerned with disdain or an air of superiority .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
According to the Committee , there was an increasing tendency to recruit women migrant workers for commercial ( sexual ) exploitation through arranged marriages with foreigners or by getting them to sign contracts of employment that look tempting but rarely reflect the real situation .  
The recent economic crisis in some countries in the region has worsened further the situation for many , especially the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including women , children , older persons , disabled persons , minority groups and migrant workers .  
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration . 
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .
