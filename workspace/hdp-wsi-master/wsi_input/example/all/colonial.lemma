Sadly , an extreme minority of stubborn splittist elements in Taiwan actually treated the author Yoshinori Kobayashi as their honored guest .  Not only did they meticulously give pointers to the author on how to depict Japan 's " glorious " colonial rule of Taiwan , but also repeatedly advised the author to tell the readers that " if not for the Japanese , Taiwan today would be a place worse than Hainan Island . "  
On 30 March , Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori told the visiting Renmin Ribao delegation that the Japanese Government 's basic approach to history and the events in the past is , as expressed by former prime minister Murayama in a speech that was decided by the cabinet meeting to make public in 1995 , that Japan expresses its deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the serious harms and pains caused by Japan 's colonial rule and aggression to the people in many countries , especially various Asian countries .  
If the Japanese young people and children , beginning from thejunior high school textbooks , learn that " the aggression was reasonable , " " thewar was creditable , " and the aggression war was a " need " and was " aimed atterminating the colonial destiny of Asia " from the history " education , " then itis undoubtedly wishful thinking that can never be realized to hope that Chinaand Japan will keep a more peaceful and friendly relationship in futurecooperation and that Asia will enjoy a long-lasting stable environment for itsdevelopment .  
The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .  This has fully revealed the conspiracy of Japanese rightwing forces in wallowing in the mire with Taiwan independence forces and stepping up their merger .  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
At home , Junichiro Koizumi has never experienced the same hardships endured by the broad masses of laboring people .  While studying abroad , Junichiro Koizumi never bothered to learn about , either , the miseries suffered by the people of neighboring Asian countries when the Japanese militarists invaded their countries and imposed colonial rule .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .

Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
When Hong Kong moved into the final years of the transitional period , the last governor dispatched by the British side dished out a " three violation " political reform scheme , tried hard to foster their political proxy and extend the influence of their colonial rule , and attempted to create disorder and confusion to undermine the comprehensive implementation of the Basic Law in the future SAR .  
The developed countries enjoy dominating benefits from the economic globalization while many developing countries are burdened with heavy debts mainly due to long-time colonial rule and plunder , and an international economic order which is unjust and unreasonable .  
They have burned up the basic law and cursed the temporary legislature as " a red pig transport truck heading to hell " ; they ran off to foreign countries to petition them to " sanction " China , and appealed to the English colonial governor to not leave a penny to the government of the special zone .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
As Hong Kong and Macao had experienced long-time colonial rules , to comprehensively and accurately implement the basic laws , it should need a process .  It is necessary for us to make long-term efforts and , on the basis of loving the country and Hong Kong , jointly unite the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to strive for creating a kind of social environment which is favorable to implementing and fulfilling the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and the basic laws .  
The negro slave trade once flourished as a means of developing the resources of Europe 's colonial territories ; with the worldwide abolition of slave trading in the middle nineteenth century , an alternative source of labor was identified in the Chinese .  
Three hundred years ago , colonial powers including England and Holland , looking to develop the rubber plantations and tin mines of southeast Asia , sought workers among the densely packed , poverty-stricken Chinese populations of Fukien and Kwangtung along the southeast coast of China . This created a huge wave of economic migration .  
The aroma of caramel wafts into the room . A scent of roasted peanuts , the smell of stew , barbecued meat , herbal medicine , jasmine , dust , incense , charcoal . . . . " Such were the memories of Marguerite Duras , who was born and grew up in Vietnam under French colonial rule . In her novel L'amant , she recalls the elegance of Tan An , the Chinatown of Saigon ( today Ho Chi Minh City ) located in the west of the city 's sixth district .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
The colonial authorities were anxious to find quarters as quickly as possible for their soldiers , government officials , and accompanying family members . In young and ascendant Taipei they found a city of big , new homes with a broad belt of farmland on the outskirts that promised unlimited potential for development . They settled into Taipei and ruled the island from there for the next 50 years .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
At the height of its production the Wushulin plant pressed as much as 1,600 metric tons of cane daily . Not only did Wushulin have a huge capacity , its products were of excellent quality and were specially designated for use by the Japanese royal household . As a result , the plant was much praised by the colonial " motherland . "  
The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic , financial and other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and racial equality .  
As all who had emerged from long periods of colonial rule were well aware , factors both internal and external could reduce independence to a mere legal formality unless it had solid economic foundations .  
Having regard to the constructive role played by previous United Nations visiting missions to colonial Territories , the Committee continues to attach vital importance to the dispatching of such missions as a means of collecting adequate and firsthand information on conditions in the Territories and on the wishes and aspirations of the people concerning their future status .

Liberia , which was founded about half a century before the Berlin Congress of 1884 , which carved out Africa and institutionalized colonialism as an asylum for free people of colour fleeing the hot crucibles and bitter pangs of slavery , was threatened with partition and trusteeship by the League of Nations , predecessor to our beloved United Nations , half a century after that colonial Congress . Ironically , the charge was slave trading .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .

Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .

Anyone who visits the famous museums in Europe and the Americas will see many works of art and valuable manuscripts exquisitely wrought by the artistic creative hands of Arab Libyans , who left behind a great historical heritage which was looted and scattered around the world by the colonial Powers , which stripped away many of its most important features .  The Arab Libyans laid the foundations of ancient , prehistoric civilizations .

Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;

It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
As political competition was not rooted in viable national economic systems , in many instances the prevailing structure of incentives favoured capturing the institutional remnants of the colonial economy for factional advantage .  
It was ironic that a State which considered itself an international champion of human rights saw fit to direct others towards civilized solutions , but was unable to deal with its own colonial legacy .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
At a time when the entire world is mobilized to create great and viable economic and political groupings to meet the challenges of globalization , Africa should not get bogged down in wars that dismember States that are already greatly fragmented as a result of the politically expedient borders we inherited through colonial laws .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Decides to consider at its fifty _ sixth session the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self _ determination under the agenda item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation .

For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
Despite the surfeit of pious excuses that has been found to justify ethically the launching of this overseas colonial enterprise , and the pseudo _ juridical ( sometimes even openly anti-juridical ) reasoning which has attempted to defend it legally , there is irrefutable evidence that its clearly _ defined goals had nothing either humanitarian or civilizing about them .  
The inherent nature of the colonial undertaking , the exploitative , discriminatory and dominating character of its philosophy as a system , the methods employed and the final results it had on very dissimilar societies mark the difference .  
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
There are abundant examples of this : the 1898 Joint Resolution under which the U.S . Congress , after using force to impose a treaty , consummated the outright annexation of the sovereign State of Hawaii ( which had manifold international juridical relations with other civilized nations ) , and the scramble for Africa formalized at the 1885 Berlin Congress by the colonial powers of the epoch are just two of the many examples .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
The missionary tradition emphasized religion-based general education ( religious conversion and instruction formed the core of the curriculum followed by secondary boarding schools ) geared towards employment in the lowest ranks of the colonial administration . 
Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
In addition to discrimination , violence and poverty , Palestinian women faced the harsh oppressive reality of the Israeli occupation on a daily basis : the construction and expansion of illegal Israeli colonial settlements , the confiscation of land and water , and the recurrent closing of the borders of the occupied Palestinian Territory , which included Jerusalem .  
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
Unless the imposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial Powers is recognized as an essential historical factor in many current conflicts and unless the right to independence and self-determination is accepted and the diversity of cultures and models comprehended , conflicts will continue .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
Having been the victims of antipersonnel mines planted by the forces of colonial Powers , Eritreans are aware of the grief and suffering caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of these evil weapons .  
According to a recent white paper , the latter had moved all its dependent Territories from their former colonial status into a modern partnership status that extended to administrative , economic , social and environmental matters .  
The representative of Guam stated that under their present colonial status , the Chamorro people of Guam continued to experience negative consequences , affecting their political , social and economic conditions .  
We have observed that the continent inherited a myriad of ills from the colonial past , which fundamentally affected the social , political and economic foundations of its society , thus constraining its present capacity for stability and development .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .  Those measures should completely do away with any apprehension the international community might have that laws inherited from the British colonial Government might be applied so as to facilitate forced labour in the territory of Myanmar .

Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;

Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
Sadly , an extreme minority of stubborn splittist elements in Taiwan actually treated the author Yoshinori Kobayashi as their honored guest .  Not only did they meticulously give pointers to the author on how to depict Japan 's " glorious " colonial rule of Taiwan , but also repeatedly advised the author to tell the readers that " if not for the Japanese , Taiwan today would be a place worse than Hainan Island . "  
On 30 March , Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori told the visiting Renmin Ribao delegation that the Japanese Government 's basic approach to history and the events in the past is , as expressed by former prime minister Murayama in a speech that was decided by the cabinet meeting to make public in 1995 , that Japan expresses its deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the serious harms and pains caused by Japan 's colonial rule and aggression to the people in many countries , especially various Asian countries .  
If the Japanese young people and children , beginning from thejunior high school textbooks , learn that " the aggression was reasonable , " " thewar was creditable , " and the aggression war was a " need " and was " aimed atterminating the colonial destiny of Asia " from the history " education , " then itis undoubtedly wishful thinking that can never be realized to hope that Chinaand Japan will keep a more peaceful and friendly relationship in futurecooperation and that Asia will enjoy a long-lasting stable environment for itsdevelopment .  
The ruling Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not lacking in rightwing forces hostile to China ; they do not want to see a reunified and strong China , and still harbor covetous ambitions regarding Taiwan , China 's sacred territory , hence they look with great favor on Lee Teng-hui , who fondly remembers Japan 's colonial rule over Taiwan , and have supported Lee Teng-hui 's visit with coordinated action .  This has fully revealed the conspiracy of Japanese rightwing forces in wallowing in the mire with Taiwan independence forces and stepping up their merger .  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
At home , Junichiro Koizumi has never experienced the same hardships endured by the broad masses of laboring people .  While studying abroad , Junichiro Koizumi never bothered to learn about , either , the miseries suffered by the people of neighboring Asian countries when the Japanese militarists invaded their countries and imposed colonial rule .  
The " one country , two systems " formula is a new attempt unprecedented in human history .  However , Hong Kong people have succeeded .  Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .

Besides overcoming the difficulties and burden left over by the colonial rulers , Hong Kong withstood the external economic storm as well as the attempt by internal and external forces to " resist China and throw Hong Kong into chaos " when it was not yet stable during the initial period after the handover .  
When Hong Kong moved into the final years of the transitional period , the last governor dispatched by the British side dished out a " three violation " political reform scheme , tried hard to foster their political proxy and extend the influence of their colonial rule , and attempted to create disorder and confusion to undermine the comprehensive implementation of the Basic Law in the future SAR .  
The developed countries enjoy dominating benefits from the economic globalization while many developing countries are burdened with heavy debts mainly due to long-time colonial rule and plunder , and an international economic order which is unjust and unreasonable .  
They have burned up the basic law and cursed the temporary legislature as " a red pig transport truck heading to hell " ; they ran off to foreign countries to petition them to " sanction " China , and appealed to the English colonial governor to not leave a penny to the government of the special zone .  
Some foreign missionaries directly served colonial expansion , took part in selling opium , gathered intelligence , encouraged and participated in military aggression , seized economic gains , took part in plotting to force the government to sign unequal treaties , relied on the special privileges provided by unequal treaties , ran wild in the countryside , bullied and humiliated the people , and stirred up the opposition of the people .  
As Hong Kong and Macao had experienced long-time colonial rules , to comprehensively and accurately implement the basic laws , it should need a process .  It is necessary for us to make long-term efforts and , on the basis of loving the country and Hong Kong , jointly unite the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to strive for creating a kind of social environment which is favorable to implementing and fulfilling the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and the basic laws .  
The negro slave trade once flourished as a means of developing the resources of Europe 's colonial territories ; with the worldwide abolition of slave trading in the middle nineteenth century , an alternative source of labor was identified in the Chinese .  
Three hundred years ago , colonial powers including England and Holland , looking to develop the rubber plantations and tin mines of southeast Asia , sought workers among the densely packed , poverty-stricken Chinese populations of Fukien and Kwangtung along the southeast coast of China . This created a huge wave of economic migration .  
The aroma of caramel wafts into the room . A scent of roasted peanuts , the smell of stew , barbecued meat , herbal medicine , jasmine , dust , incense , charcoal . . . . " Such were the memories of Marguerite Duras , who was born and grew up in Vietnam under French colonial rule . In her novel L'amant , she recalls the elegance of Tan An , the Chinatown of Saigon ( today Ho Chi Minh City ) located in the west of the city 's sixth district .  
This in turn drew on the neoclassical style that appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century . That style emphasized " reason " and rationality , which designers of the period found embodied in the nearly pure geometric shapes of classical architecture . This trend , combined with the cultural exchange that came from colonial expansionism and the rise of archaeology as a field of study , produced new structures in Europe that incorporated a number of classical themes into a single building .  
After learning more about the great masses of women of previous generations , you suddenly feel close to all women , as if all were family , and feel pained by how this patriarchal and colonial society of Taiwan has oppressed women and given them no respect over the normal course of their lives . These books drive home the importance of the women 's and Taiwan autonomy movements , so as to prevent society here from regressing as a result of political troubles .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
The colonial authorities were anxious to find quarters as quickly as possible for their soldiers , government officials , and accompanying family members . In young and ascendant Taipei they found a city of big , new homes with a broad belt of farmland on the outskirts that promised unlimited potential for development . They settled into Taipei and ruled the island from there for the next 50 years .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
When a Japanese technician discovered groves of towering ancient trees on Mt . Ali at the end of the 19th century , the Japanese colonial administration hired a forester to survey the mountain 's timber . He found excellent stands of timber-red cypress , yellow cypress and Taiwan yew trees that were upwards of a thousand years old and that required as many as ten men to encircle . To get these giant trees to market , the Japanese began to construct the Alishan Mountain Railway in 1906 .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
During the era of Japanese rule , the colonial rulers pursued a policy of Japanizing Taiwan . They destroyed Chinese Taoist temples and built Shinto shrines , and they strictly prohibited the use of traditional Chinese ceremonial objects , such as incense burner tripods and orange-shaped lanterns used in traditional worship . Families put these under tables or in storage , where they rusted or tarnished .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
In the eyes of the Japanese colonial authorities , Chiang was Public Enemy No . 1 . Among Taiwanese intellectuals , he was widely recognized as a pioneer . And among ordinary citizens he was revered as a charismatic leader , a guiding force for cultural renaissance and a dedicated opponent of the injustices of the colonial regime .  
Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .  
However , " although Chiang Wei-shui and others were found guilty in the Social Order and Police Incident , " writes Huang Huang-hsiung in his Chiang biography , " they indirectly benefited from this , because it became a focal point for the political and social movement . " The overreaction and repression by the colonial authorities against these activists-whose petition campaign was moderate and perfectly legal , and whose cultural association restricted itself to educational activities-not only fueled popular resentment , but also hardened the attitudes of activists toward the regime .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
At the height of its production the Wushulin plant pressed as much as 1,600 metric tons of cane daily . Not only did Wushulin have a huge capacity , its products were of excellent quality and were specially designated for use by the Japanese royal household . As a result , the plant was much praised by the colonial " motherland . "  
The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic , financial and other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and racial equality .  
As all who had emerged from long periods of colonial rule were well aware , factors both internal and external could reduce independence to a mere legal formality unless it had solid economic foundations .  
Having regard to the constructive role played by previous United Nations visiting missions to colonial Territories , the Committee continues to attach vital importance to the dispatching of such missions as a means of collecting adequate and firsthand information on conditions in the Territories and on the wishes and aspirations of the people concerning their future status .  
Having considered the item entitled " Activities of foreign economic and other interests which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism , apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa " ,  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Urges the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in cooperation with the regional and other organizations where appropriate , to submit to their governing and legislative organs concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations decisions , particularly specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and their national liberation movements ;  
Liberia , which was founded about half a century before the Berlin Congress of 1884 , which carved out Africa and institutionalized colonialism as an asylum for free people of colour fleeing the hot crucibles and bitter pangs of slavery , was threatened with partition and trusteeship by the League of Nations , predecessor to our beloved United Nations , half a century after that colonial Congress . Ironically , the charge was slave trading .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .

This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .

Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .

It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
Anyone who visits the famous museums in Europe and the Americas will see many works of art and valuable manuscripts exquisitely wrought by the artistic creative hands of Arab Libyans , who left behind a great historical heritage which was looted and scattered around the world by the colonial Powers , which stripped away many of its most important features .  The Arab Libyans laid the foundations of ancient , prehistoric civilizations .  
Although pre _ colonial Rwanda was inhabited by the same peoples as are found there today , namely , the Hutus ( of Bantu origin ) , the Tutsi ( of Hamitic descent ) and the Twas ( pymoid type ) , these three peoples , organized in more or less autonomous kingdoms , did not constitute opposing dominant and dominated ethnic groups . 
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .

It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
As political competition was not rooted in viable national economic systems , in many instances the prevailing structure of incentives favoured capturing the institutional remnants of the colonial economy for factional advantage .  
It was ironic that a State which considered itself an international champion of human rights saw fit to direct others towards civilized solutions , but was unable to deal with its own colonial legacy .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
At a time when the entire world is mobilized to create great and viable economic and political groupings to meet the challenges of globalization , Africa should not get bogged down in wars that dismember States that are already greatly fragmented as a result of the politically expedient borders we inherited through colonial laws .

By resolution 8 ( XXIII ) of 16 March 1967 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to give annual consideration to the item entitled Question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
Despite the surfeit of pious excuses that has been found to justify ethically the launching of this overseas colonial enterprise , and the pseudo _ juridical ( sometimes even openly anti-juridical ) reasoning which has attempted to defend it legally , there is irrefutable evidence that its clearly _ defined goals had nothing either humanitarian or civilizing about them .  
The inherent nature of the colonial undertaking , the exploitative , discriminatory and dominating character of its philosophy as a system , the methods employed and the final results it had on very dissimilar societies mark the difference .  
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
Furthermore , this motivation ( in the direct interest of the non-indigenous party ) was quite clear : to legitimize ( via the acquiescence of the autochthonous sovereign of the territories in question ) any right ( real or intended ) with which they could counter opposing claims advanced by other colonial powers vying for control of those lands .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
There are abundant examples of this : the 1898 Joint Resolution under which the U.S . Congress , after using force to impose a treaty , consummated the outright annexation of the sovereign State of Hawaii ( which had manifold international juridical relations with other civilized nations ) , and the scramble for Africa formalized at the 1885 Berlin Congress by the colonial powers of the epoch are just two of the many examples .  
Japan , from the first days of its aggression against Korea , especially during the nearly half a century-long period of its military occupation of and colonial rule over Korea from the early twentieth century , pillaged and destroyed a considerable amount of valuable cultural property , which the Korean people had handed down with utmost care generation after generation .  
The missionary tradition emphasized religion-based general education ( religious conversion and instruction formed the core of the curriculum followed by secondary boarding schools ) geared towards employment in the lowest ranks of the colonial administration . 
Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
If we really want to find effective and lasting solutions we can not overlook the fact that the roots of the current problems are found in the centuries of colonial exploitation during which African economies were looted and distorted in order to turn them into providers of natural resources , raw materials and cheap manpower at the cost of the annihilation and enslavement of tens of millions of people . 
As the new millennium dawned , Bolivia hoped that the United Nations might soon be able to proclaim a world free of colonial vestiges , free of oppression and economic , political and social dependency and respectful of democratic values and fundamental human rights .  
In addition to discrimination , violence and poverty , Palestinian women faced the harsh oppressive reality of the Israeli occupation on a daily basis : the construction and expansion of illegal Israeli colonial settlements , the confiscation of land and water , and the recurrent closing of the borders of the occupied Palestinian Territory , which included Jerusalem .  
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
Unless the imposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial Powers is recognized as an essential historical factor in many current conflicts and unless the right to independence and self-determination is accepted and the diversity of cultures and models comprehended , conflicts will continue .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
Having been the victims of antipersonnel mines planted by the forces of colonial Powers , Eritreans are aware of the grief and suffering caused by the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of these evil weapons .  
According to a recent white paper , the latter had moved all its dependent Territories from their former colonial status into a modern partnership status that extended to administrative , economic , social and environmental matters .  
The representative of Guam stated that under their present colonial status , the Chamorro people of Guam continued to experience negative consequences , affecting their political , social and economic conditions .  
We have observed that the continent inherited a myriad of ills from the colonial past , which fundamentally affected the social , political and economic foundations of its society , thus constraining its present capacity for stability and development .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .  Those measures should completely do away with any apprehension the international community might have that laws inherited from the British colonial Government might be applied so as to facilitate forced labour in the territory of Myanmar .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right ,  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;

Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .
