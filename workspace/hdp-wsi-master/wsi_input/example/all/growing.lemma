The new challenges faced by the HA include strong demand for public housing , growing aspirations for home ownership , high expectations of services , the call for close partnership with the private sector and the need to achieve optimal cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency within the Housing Department . 
The Financial Secretary , Mr Donald Tsang , says there is a growing consensus among Hong Kong 's major trading partners that there needs to be ' quick and decisive ' efforts to deal with the current global economic and financial crisis .  
The history of the infrastructure development in Hong Kong has been closely linked to the need to accommodate and serve a continuously growing population and the corresponding need to expand our economic activities .  The implementation of our infrastructure projects is complicated by the confined space in which these projects have to be located and the short time within which the projects have to be planned and implemented because of our rapidly growing demand .  
As its popularity is growing fast in recent years , many nursed and hybrid species with flowers of peach red , scarlet and dual colours ( e.g . white / red ) are available . 
More importantly , Hong Kong 's edge over the other East Asian economies has been underpinned by a host of other factors , such as a good quality labour force , a low and simple taxation system , a stable government , a corruption free society , an efficient transport and telecommunications infrastructure , sound legal and regulatory systems , free flow of information , and most important of all , a huge and rapidly growing hinterland just to the north of Hong Kong , " Mr Tsang said .  
Speaking at a speaker luncheon meeting of the Hong Kong Institute of Directors , the Chief Secretary pointed out that the public sector has faced and continues to face a daunting change agenda , including the return of Hong Kong to China , the changing face of its economy , growing needs within the population combined with rising expectations , Asian economic downturn , and most proactively , the Chief Executive 's compelling vision of Hong Kong as the world city in Asia . 
As a measure to further enhance the quality of public library services and to meet growing public demand for information , the Provisional Urban Council ( PUC ) has decided to upgrade its public library computer system and provide digital library system at the future Hong Kong Central Library , apart from wider use of information technology in public library service which is now being implemented .  
The Chief Executive stressed that in the last 50 years , China had undergone some unbelievable changes and that the society on the whole was very stable , the economy was growing , people 's livelihood was improving , and that China 's international position was increasingly being recognised and respected .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .

The vigorous economic growth of China , the successful launch of the " Shenzhou " spacecraft and the initialling of the Sino-American agreement on China 's accession to WTO all reflected very favourably on the growing stature of the country , the progress it has been making in technological developments as well as its rising status in the international arena .  
The LCSD has been committed to providing quality leisure and cultural services for the public since its establishment on January 1 this year .  In view of the rapid technological development and growing popularity of the use of electronic money these days , the Department has actively studied the use of electronic money for payment of fees to provide greater convenience to the public in using our recreational and sports facilities .

Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
Dr Ho pointed out that the primary objective of authorising football betting was to combat the growing problem of illegal football gambling by diverting existing demand for football betting into a regulatory channel .  
He said : " The success of Shenzhou V highlights the country 's growing strength as it enjoys the most stable , energetic , comprehensive and fruitful period of development in the contemporary history of China . Full of enthusiasm , the people are prepared to work for a brighter future .  It also demonstrates that the nation 's grand objective to scale new heights can be achieved . "  
Today this new plant at Tung Hsiao produces 100,000 metric tons of high quality refined salt annually . About 130,000 metric tons of crude salt originally required as raw material for the manufacturing of refined salt will be saved annually to meet the pressing needs of rapidly growing industries .  
Summer is the time for this seasonal fruit . Markets and fruit peddlers ' carts are piled up with fresh pineapples delivered to the towns from the growing districts . The unique fragrance of pineapples carries afar . Their bright yellow meat is sweet and juicy , their prices low .  
Her ideal of returning to nature by growing flowers first took root then . One day as she was driving through the countryside , she came across a piece of fallow land owned by an elderly couple who agreed to rent it to her for US $ 150 a month .  
Some could tolerate the cold , but were not too tasty ; others were large and flavorful , but required a long maturation period . Scientists bred to achieve a hardy , plump , tasty , quick growing fish .  
This instance is among many indicative of the growing popularity , of the art both at home and abroad . Taiwanese opera is now the most popular form of theater on Taiwan . It incorporates elements of folk music , folk songs , and classical music , and has roots set firmly in the Chinese tradition of didactic tales . Its themes are serious , yet its movements are very lively , very accessible to audiences , accounting for its great popularity .  
The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
Golden Bells Ring for ROC Broadcasting Industry The theme for this year 's prestigious Golden Bell Awards , " A nomination is winning an award , " evidences the growing competitiveness and improved quality of broadcasting in the Republic of China . This annual gala event , which salutes those outstanding individuals who work in the radio and television industry , used an expanded format to emphasize industry successes this year .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Hainan , like southern Taiwan and southern Yunnan , has tropical seasonal winds , year-round summer , and abundant rainfall , making it possible to achieve three or four harvests a year . And the south of the island is suited for growing coffee , rubber trees , and other tropical crops .  
Our economic growth rate has averaged 8.5 percent over the past ten years , an accomplishment which is the focus of world attention . Like a growing adolescent , full of boundless potential , we 're of great interest to overseas investors , " says Shen Po-ling , explaining why ROC stocks are desired so much by foreign investors .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
During their first winter they discovered that the mountain , situated some 2,000 meters above sea level , had at least 1,000 hours a year of temperatures below seven degrees centigrade , making it a rare region of low temperatures in semitropical Taiwan and highly suited for growing temperate-zone crops . "  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
As envisioned at the Council of Agriculture , recreation agriculture in Taiwan will embrace farming , livestock , forestry and fishing in line with the special features of each area . Visitors will get to admire the countryside in its endless seasonal transformation , and have a go at growing rice , picking tea or catching fish . They can also experience local culture in progress , and see temple festivities , open-air performances and prayers for the harvest .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
In the neighborhood of Wu Tzu-tien ( a tree named for the only female emperor in Chinese history ) , there is a small stretch of Taiwan sassafras growing . The supple leaves of this plant are a favorite food for Papilio xuthus butterflies , and if your luck is running good you 'll be able to see these two protected species , one plant , one animal , side-by-side .  
You might see a great spread of white mushrooms growing on the withered trunk of an old dead maple , truly manifesting the idea " working even at the time of death . " It used to be that maple trees provided the best place for raising mushrooms , but sadly , in recent years the maples were almost all cut down , and they are very rare these days , so production has shifted to germ-free packaged propagation .  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland . But , if it 's a large enterprise , an important industry , or an infrastructure investment , the movement of these kinds of investments into the mainland one after another is not beneficial to our national development , and we must take more stringent measures .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
Mrs . Hung , who grew up in Tanshui and runs a seafood restaurant , nostalgically recalls eating chouduyu ( a siganid ) caught at the mouth of the Tanshui River . She says : " Natural chouduyu did n't even need salt , it tasted fragrant and sweet just fried up straight . If you buy chouduyu that was raised in an aquaculture pond , you have to add soy sauce just to cover the smell of the earth . " But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
Yueliang-wan became a mecca for archeological research in Sichuan Province . A succession of wars , however , brought archeological work to a halt for many years before experts were finally able to return to Yueliang-wan and Sanxingdui in the 1950s and 60s . The growing number of sites and the enormous collection of jades and pottery that were gradually unearthed in scattered excavations led archeologists to suspect that the area might have been one of the principal cities of southwest China 's Shu kingdom in prehistoric times .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . " Li described the ensuing scenario : " Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine-gun approach . Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August .

In contrast to its fellow " Little Dragons , " Taiwan 's economic policy has been waffling since 1997 . With so much still up in the air , foreign investors have been unwilling to put their money into Taiwan and local businesspeople have begun losing patience with the government 's dithering .

Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible . In fact , they are often at cross-purposes , and the resulting confusion has made it still more difficult for Taiwan to chart a course for the future .

Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .

The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .

Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
In a climate of growing radicalization , extremists from the two main ethnic groups in the country are engaged in a round of violence that includes selective killings , massacres of civilians and the destruction of national economic assets and infrastructure .

While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .

In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control .

Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .

While the idea of an international criminal court had been on the international agenda for centuries , the past few years had seen promising developments , arousing more enthusiasm for the process than ever before , as evidenced by the constant increase in the number of countries favouring the early establishment of such a court .  That increase was encouraging , as was the growing public awareness of the need for perpetrators of heinous crimes to be brought to justice .  
The proposal by Mexico to initiate a review of practical ways and means to strengthen the International Court of Justice ( A / 52 / 33 , paras . 123-130 ) deserved more detailed consideration in the light of the Courts growing workload and the emerging interest in its potential for preventive diplomacy .  115 .  Another proposal which merited further study was the suggestion by Cuba in its working paper ( A / 52 / 33 , chap .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
Recognizing also the efforts made so far and the determination of the Mediterranean countries to intensify the process of dialogue and consultations with a view to resolving the problems existing in the Mediterranean region and to eliminating the causes of tension and the consequent threat to peace and security , and their growing awareness of the need for further joint efforts to strengthen economic , social , cultural and environmental cooperation in the region ,

Recognizes that the White Helmets , as an operational partner of the United Nations Volunteers , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogenous teams available to the United Nations system , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number and growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme , however and by whomever that is defined , and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
Although missions to Mars are widely publicized and assurances are given that the world economy is growing , the distressing truth remains that today in the world a-billion people are illiterate ; as many are unemployed or underemployed ; and more than 2-billion are living under subhuman conditions .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
People are being denied their basic rights ; their houses , shops , mosques , churches and synagogues are burned to the ground ; they are beaten up , maimed and even killed ; and all this in the name of an evil we call racism , which does not leave its victims alone even after they die : the number of cemeteries that are being desecrated is growing at a worrisome pace .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
The rapid ageing of societies in Asia and the Pacific , accompanied by the increasing proportion and absolute number of older persons in the population , has triggered concern for older persons in the region , while the economic and social impact of the ageing of populations poses a growing challenge to societies throughout the region .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .

Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .

The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .  
The phenomenon of protracted and growing displacement , warfare that targets civilians and demolishes communities , and the disintegration of political , institutional and economic structures in crisis countries all point to the need for a better understanding of crises and their adverse impact on vulnerable communities .  
Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
In a rapidly and deeply changing world characterized by the growing importance of ethical issues , a culture of peace provides the young generation with a set of values which can help them to shape their destiny and actively participate in constructing a more just , humane , free and prosperous society and a better , peaceful world .  
The difficulties faced by developing countries in seeking access to trade , labour and finance flows were exacerbated by protectionist barriers raised by the advanced countries because of the unfounded fear that globalization was one of the major causes of the high unemployment rate and growing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled labour . 
In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
One result is that growing attention is being paid at the national level to the need to combine increased contestability with competition policies aimed at preventing market concentration and abuse of dominant positions , and / or with policies directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of domestic enterprises .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
The Internet had the alarming potential of creating and reinforcing an electronically disenfranchised underclass , which would prevent the improvement of racial equality in a growing range of human and social needs and transactions .  
Among the complex tasks of reviving the economy there is one solid priority : the formation of a national market and a continuously growing solvent internal consumer demand with an increasing share in the production structure .  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
In 1989 , in cooperation with the World Bank , Jordan had elaborated a comprehensive economic reform programme designed to curb inflation , reduce the growing external debt and stop the decline in the gross domestic product .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .

Added to these natural disasters are man-made catastrophes like widespread minefields , the dumping of radioactive and toxic wastes , the growing number of regional and internal civil wars and the ensuing problems of refugees and famine .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .

Of equal concern to the international community is the growing threat faced by humanitarian workers , who risk their personal safety for the noble purpose of alleviating suffering and hardship .  
The prospects of solving those problems were diminished by the deepening of poverty , accelerated by the spread of the current global economic crisis , the shameful decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) , the growing number of humanitarian crises involving children , and the explosion of the HIV / AIDS pandemic , the devastating effects of which threatened to undermine the hard-won gains on behalf of children .  
Whereas the national or subnational knowledge base on the organized criminal groups and their operations is growing , there is no comprehensive global overview of organized crime , a requisite for effective international action to counteract this global menace .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Immigrants are often the victims of verbal abuse and physical violence on the part of militants from ultra _ rightist parties and extremist and xenophobic organizations , as well as of growing institutional racism , discriminatory legislation and harsh police repression . 
This is exacerbated by the rapid expansion of the informal sector of the economies of industrialized migrant-receiving countries and the growing demand for irregular migrant workers who , by definition , constitute an unprotected , docile and easily exploited workforce .  
One of the main reasons for growing domestic violence , both in overt and covert forms , is in the lack of a legal and moral environment for effectively opposing it .  
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
While continuing to provide regional comparable statistics and indicators needed for assessing and monitoring progress achieved in sustainable development in the ESCWA region , during the biennium 20002001 , the subprogramme will concentrate on upgrading these services to better respond to the renewed and growing interest in statistics and indicators covering a wide range of economic , social and , for the first time , environmental concerns associated with sustainable development .  
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .

Taking into account the growing spread of poverty and its highly negative social and political dimensions , the special session may wish to consider what kind of national , regional and international measures can be recommended in order to reverse the negative trends .  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
In the case of TCDC activities outside the system - i.e . , projects that are initiated , funded and executed in a spontaneous manner between bilateral partners - a parallel increase in the number of participating or beneficiary countries appears to reflect directly the steady improvement of the technical capabilities and funding resources of a growing number of developing countries willing to share their experiences with others .

The GEF with its focus on additional concessional funding to meet incremental costs of projects of global benefits in the four focal areas of climate change , biological diversity , the ozone layer and international waters has a special and growing role .  
In view of the continuous expansion of the functions and responsibilities of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section of the Secretariat to meet the demand of a growing number of applications for consultative status as well as the diverse , more substantive demands of a larger and more active non-governmental organizations community , the Committee suggested , at its resumed 1998 session , that this item remain in the agenda of the Committee .  
While non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were a driving force for social development , the steady increase in poverty among the hard core poor and the growing disparity in levels of consumption indicated that the poorest sectors could be better addressed by community-based organizations capable of developing innovative programmes that took into account the non-static characteristics of poverty .

Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
Dr Ho pointed out that the primary objective of authorising football betting was to combat the growing problem of illegal football gambling by diverting existing demand for football betting into a regulatory channel .  
He said : " The success of Shenzhou V highlights the country 's growing strength as it enjoys the most stable , energetic , comprehensive and fruitful period of development in the contemporary history of China . Full of enthusiasm , the people are prepared to work for a brighter future .  It also demonstrates that the nation 's grand objective to scale new heights can be achieved . "  
Today this new plant at Tung Hsiao produces 100,000 metric tons of high quality refined salt annually . About 130,000 metric tons of crude salt originally required as raw material for the manufacturing of refined salt will be saved annually to meet the pressing needs of rapidly growing industries .  
Summer is the time for this seasonal fruit . Markets and fruit peddlers ' carts are piled up with fresh pineapples delivered to the towns from the growing districts . The unique fragrance of pineapples carries afar . Their bright yellow meat is sweet and juicy , their prices low .  
Her ideal of returning to nature by growing flowers first took root then . One day as she was driving through the countryside , she came across a piece of fallow land owned by an elderly couple who agreed to rent it to her for US $ 150 a month .  
Some could tolerate the cold , but were not too tasty ; others were large and flavorful , but required a long maturation period . Scientists bred to achieve a hardy , plump , tasty , quick growing fish .  
This instance is among many indicative of the growing popularity , of the art both at home and abroad . Taiwanese opera is now the most popular form of theater on Taiwan . It incorporates elements of folk music , folk songs , and classical music , and has roots set firmly in the Chinese tradition of didactic tales . Its themes are serious , yet its movements are very lively , very accessible to audiences , accounting for its great popularity .  
The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
Golden Bells Ring for ROC Broadcasting Industry The theme for this year 's prestigious Golden Bell Awards , " A nomination is winning an award , " evidences the growing competitiveness and improved quality of broadcasting in the Republic of China . This annual gala event , which salutes those outstanding individuals who work in the radio and television industry , used an expanded format to emphasize industry successes this year .  
Apart from foreign debts , many communist ideologues find other reasons to oppose the current liberal policies . Some deplore the presence of " spiritual pollution " , seeing a growing materialism among mainland Chinese . Others view foreign investment as pure and simple exploitation of cheap labor , with the special treatment afforded to foreign firms and their workers inimical to the spirit of equality that communism was supposed to bring .  
After years of construction , our political system is quite vigorous and our society is gradually growing more diverse . We maintain trade , scientific , and cultural relations with over 140 countries around the world , but because our government adopts a policy of no compromise , no negotiations , and no contacts to resist the " united front " tactics of the Communists , we have been misunderstood by the international community as stiff-necked conservatives . What is the Premier 's view ?  
Hainan , like southern Taiwan and southern Yunnan , has tropical seasonal winds , year-round summer , and abundant rainfall , making it possible to achieve three or four harvests a year . And the south of the island is suited for growing coffee , rubber trees , and other tropical crops .  
Our economic growth rate has averaged 8.5 percent over the past ten years , an accomplishment which is the focus of world attention . Like a growing adolescent , full of boundless potential , we 're of great interest to overseas investors , " says Shen Po-ling , explaining why ROC stocks are desired so much by foreign investors .  
The narcissus dish pictured here , when observed from the front , stares directly at you with its two large eyes , while its pair of massive pincers serve as the supporting feet of the vessel . It seems as though the narcissus is growing on the body of the crab , making quite an interesting picture , much like the ancient legend of the mountain of the immortals upon the sea , which rested on the back of a huge tortoise .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
However , in the face of this rapidly growing cohort , all countries have exhibited chaos . Some elderly are rejected from the nuclear family or are thought of as an unproductive burden on the national economy . Even more disconcerting is that health care for the elderly can lead not only to family frictions , but can overwhelm national health care systems . Aging is an unavoidable process for us .  
During their first winter they discovered that the mountain , situated some 2,000 meters above sea level , had at least 1,000 hours a year of temperatures below seven degrees centigrade , making it a rare region of low temperatures in semitropical Taiwan and highly suited for growing temperate-zone crops . "  
These combinations seem to accord with common sense , for instance wood " rules " the direction East because growing trees like the sunlight and the sun rises in the east . Metal similarly " rules " the West since metal is by nature cold and dead , and the west is the direction of the setting sun and the lack of light which spells etiolation for plant life .  
While government breeding efforts have tended to concentrate on basic cereals such as rice and wheat , economic growth and rising living standards have brought increased consumer demand for high-profit horticultural products like flowers and fruit . Farmers now devote more growing area to these , new varieties are being introduced , and private-sector involvement in variety development is on the rise .  
As envisioned at the Council of Agriculture , recreation agriculture in Taiwan will embrace farming , livestock , forestry and fishing in line with the special features of each area . Visitors will get to admire the countryside in its endless seasonal transformation , and have a go at growing rice , picking tea or catching fish . They can also experience local culture in progress , and see temple festivities , open-air performances and prayers for the harvest .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
He satirizes feminine pettiness and cupidity , but he 's afraid to get into other areas . Playing the opposite sex is even tougher to bring off since guardians of public morality keep a close watch on the airwaves , and audiences are growing a little tired of it from overuse , what with Auntie Tung , Sister Wai , Old Lady Yang , and so forth , on practically every show . Hsiao Tung will gradually " recover his manhood " in the future , Pai Mei-hung reveals .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
The outdoor stages of an earlier day have given way to vulgar , flashy song-and-dance shows and decorated electronic sound trucks , which are growing in exponential proportions . Making it new : Can traditional folk theater be combined with modern concepts and techniques to once again attract the attention of the public and reenter the life of the people ?  
Motorcyclists inhaling carcinogens behind buses , children breathing in particulates that cause respiratory and skin ailments , drivers growing drowsy from carbon monoxide . . . the damage to human health is a huge invisible social cost .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
In the neighborhood of Wu Tzu-tien ( a tree named for the only female emperor in Chinese history ) , there is a small stretch of Taiwan sassafras growing . The supple leaves of this plant are a favorite food for Papilio xuthus butterflies , and if your luck is running good you 'll be able to see these two protected species , one plant , one animal , side-by-side .  
You might see a great spread of white mushrooms growing on the withered trunk of an old dead maple , truly manifesting the idea " working even at the time of death . " It used to be that maple trees provided the best place for raising mushrooms , but sadly , in recent years the maples were almost all cut down , and they are very rare these days , so production has shifted to germ-free packaged propagation .  
Just as Sun Ta-chuan , secretary-general of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples ' Cultural Association has said , many Han Chinese have begun to realize that the everyday wisdom inherent in aboriginal culture includes important human factors which have long been lost from their own lives . Such " two-way " thinking is gradually growing into a sound and mutually adaptive interethni relationship .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
Twenty years ago , our not-so-affluent society expressed its sympathy with actions , and enabled the two-year-old Siamese twins to live on through highly sophisticated surgery , growing up to be the two bright youths of today . Can the society that prides itself on economic accomplishments exert its collective power to help them over their many future hurdles ?  
Sam Wen says that the current crop of pro players , when youths in the 1970s , ran all around the world for international competitions , bearing the burden of national pride and struggling for medals . Their growth process was somewhat distorted , leaving them with many habits such as enjoying special privileges , wanting advantages , and having a little too much self-admiration . The players must of course work harder at growing up .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
In the current situation , with cross-straits relations being less than ideal , if small and medium sized enterprises are having difficulty growing in Taiwan , we wo n't prohibit them from investing in the mainland . But , if it 's a large enterprise , an important industry , or an infrastructure investment , the movement of these kinds of investments into the mainland one after another is not beneficial to our national development , and we must take more stringent measures .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
By the close of business every day , the counter on which the organically grown fruits and vegetables are displayed is usually bare . Chen Chun-chun , CEO of Organic World , which he founded three years ago , says that Taiwan 's organic foods market is growing quickly ; annual growth is 20-30% .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
" Those of us engaged in social work appreciate that there is a difference between the ideal and the reality of the situation , " says Li Hsiung , executive director of the Taipei Elders ' Foundation . He feels that the growing prevalence of problems involving the elderly ca n't simply be attributed to a lack of filial piety on the part of their children . He says that the major factors are rather changes in lifestyle and in the family structure .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
In particular , Daoists ' choice of places to identify as fairy grottoes , apart from being suitable places to refine elixirs in the hope of transcending death , also responded to the mood of the times and to practical needs . Hence rich , fertile soil suitable for growing rice , and locations out of reach of natural disasters and human wars and turmoil , became essential requirements for the blessed abodes .  
In real life they play complex roles , and are complimented and criticized in equal measure . With the increasing occurrence of psychological disorders in modern society , the field has been growing . And those who work in this field are increasingly becoming the object of public debate .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
Mrs . Hung , who grew up in Tanshui and runs a seafood restaurant , nostalgically recalls eating chouduyu ( a siganid ) caught at the mouth of the Tanshui River . She says : " Natural chouduyu did n't even need salt , it tasted fragrant and sweet just fried up straight . If you buy chouduyu that was raised in an aquaculture pond , you have to add soy sauce just to cover the smell of the earth . " But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
Yueliang-wan became a mecca for archeological research in Sichuan Province . A succession of wars , however , brought archeological work to a halt for many years before experts were finally able to return to Yueliang-wan and Sanxingdui in the 1950s and 60s . The growing number of sites and the enormous collection of jades and pottery that were gradually unearthed in scattered excavations led archeologists to suspect that the area might have been one of the principal cities of southwest China 's Shu kingdom in prehistoric times .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
Across the broken outer wall of the Puli Distillery , someone painted in crooked and irregular letters : " What does n't kill you , makes you stronger ! " People were n't surrendering in the face of disaster . What 's more , there was a growing sense of compassion , of concern for the suffering of others . A true civil society must not be far off .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . " Li described the ensuing scenario : " Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine-gun approach . Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
A number of Chinese authors have risen to fame in recent years with books published in English , including Nien Cheng , Amy Tan , Jung Chang , and Ha Jin . Now Adeline Yen Mah has joined the list with Falling Leaves : The True Story of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter . This autobiographical account focuses especially on the author 's childhood years growing up in a wealthy but abusive family in China during a time of political upheaval .  
In the past , Taiwan exported large numbers of desk tidies made from this tree fern 's heartwood . When international trade adjudicators came to Taiwan to solemnly investigate the alleged overcropping of a rare plant , they were surprised to find flying spider-monkey ferns growing everywhere . Though seen internationally as a scarce resource , the plants were two a penny in Taiwan , so the threatened trade sanctions were dropped .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even-as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people-in different countries , many middle-aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
A turning point was reached two years ago , however , as the global Internet infrastructure began to mature . Increasingly available broadband connections offered dramatic improvements in speed , and online games began proliferating . Ever since the wave broke over Taiwan , the number Internet cafes has been growing rapidly .

Actually , as an island , Taiwan has always had an international economy . But China is growing bigger every day and cross-strait political tensions remain unresolved . Within Taiwan , the " globalist , " " China " and " Taiwan-first " factions all read this situation differently and their responses to it have been anything but compatible .

Faced with the growing threat and multifaceted problem of drug abuse , Governments have come to realize the urgent need to develop and implement a comprehensive set of responses , coordinated to achieve the maximum impact and relying on the active involvement of all government agencies and numerous bodies and institutions , including in the private sector , that play a role in drug control . 
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
The process of political harmonization and reconciliation initiated by the Government encouraged the individual and collective participation of civil society in all activities , promoting a climate of trust that to date has facilitated the functioning of a growing free market economy with social justice . 
" Today , an entirely different world picture confronts us : one in which a growing convergence of interests is becoming manifest , one in which the challenge for the international community has become not the resort to the traditional and costly mechanisms of conflict resolution , which our resources can not continue to support indefinitely , but one that looks towards utilizing the vast potential of this Organization in a different approach that relies on the productivity of diplomacy in exhausting all possible avenues to settle disputes peacefully . 
We are witnessing increasing poverty , a growing rift between rich and poor , migration , population pressure , dwindling food stocks , hazards to public health and the environment , drugs , terrorism , internal conflicts and wholesale violations of human rights : a daunting litany .

The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
That is why we view with growing concern the fact that , in supposed support of freedom and democracy , action is being taken in the opposite direction through the adoption of laws in the field of trade the nerve centre of contemporary progress that are extraterritorial in scope and in complete disagreement with the fundamental principles of international law .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
Moreover , it will be in the cities and towns of this urban world that growing social tensions and conflict , rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources , will be resolved , and where the key to true human security will be found .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States .

Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier toll than earlier international conflicts ; grave cases of violations of human rights occur ; the poorest countries are lagging behind in economic development ; the gap between rich and poor is growing ; and the environment is coming under increasing strain .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
In a climate of growing radicalization , extremists from the two main ethnic groups in the country are engaged in a round of violence that includes selective killings , massacres of civilians and the destruction of national economic assets and infrastructure .

In many cases , the unrestricted use of technology , the growing demand for goods and services from the ocean , uncontrolled population growth and continuous migration to coastal areas have led to the depletion of living resources and the degradation of the coastal and marine environment as well as of the economic conditions of some of the major sectors exploiting the ocean .  
The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications , their development would depend on the evolution of important factors , such as technological progress , the availability of orbital positions ( for geostationary satellites ) , spectral bandwidths , costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
While Governments , in the new context of the growing importance of the market and the private sector , have a diminished productive role in economic development , it is important to note that all Governments will retain responsibility for providing a regulatory framework for the effective operation of a competitive market system . 
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .

In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
" The Argentine Republic is convinced that the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would be a crucial event in fostering international trust , because it would strengthen the growing conviction that nuclear weapons are of no use for the security of nations , and would facilitate the future agenda and the negotiation of other multilateral measures regarding disarmament , non-proliferation and arms control .

Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .

In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .

Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme , however and by whomever that is defined , and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .

The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .

Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
People are being denied their basic rights ; their houses , shops , mosques , churches and synagogues are burned to the ground ; they are beaten up , maimed and even killed ; and all this in the name of an evil we call racism , which does not leave its victims alone even after they die : the number of cemeteries that are being desecrated is growing at a worrisome pace .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
The rapid ageing of societies in Asia and the Pacific , accompanied by the increasing proportion and absolute number of older persons in the population , has triggered concern for older persons in the region , while the economic and social impact of the ageing of populations poses a growing challenge to societies throughout the region .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
The technology involved in the processing and interpretation of digital satellite information and data obtained on the ground for the purposes of evaluation of crop condition and yield \ x { e8ca } echnology which is applied in an experimental operational system ( in a real-time regime ) \ x { e8c3 } akes it possible during the vegetation growing period to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the state of crops in 25 regions of the Russian Federation .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .

As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .

It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .

Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .
