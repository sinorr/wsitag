At a time when Donald Tsang Yam-kuen is about to be relieved of his post as financial secretary and to take up a more important new post as chief secretary for administration , the Hong Kong people should commend his performance since Hong Kong 's return to China and should hope the principle of prudently handling financial affairs and keeping expenditures within the limits of revenue enshrined in the Basic Law will continue to be implemented and developed in the financial work of the special administrative region in the future .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .

brought democracy into full play , kept to the mass line , and extensively solicited opinions before promulgating the drafts of important local laws and regulations .  Local people 's congresses with legislative power and their standing committees carried out anticipatory legislation in matters beyond the NPC and its standing committee 's exclusive legislative powers and where laws or administrative laws and regulations had yet to be drawn up , accumulating experience for the state to draw up corresponding laws .  
Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
On cases that closely related to the people 's production and life , which could easily lead to intensified contradictions , such as those involved forestry land , natural resources , peasants ' burdens , and removal and resettlement of residents , the courts identified responsibilities , properly resolved the disputes , and protected the legitimate rights and interests of related parties , thereby promoting administrative relations in accordance with the law . 
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .

It has been reported that as of today , the NPC and its standing committee have enacted more than 390 laws and decisions related to relevant laws , and local people 's congresses have enacted more than 8,000 local statutes .

At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .  
To more effectively perfect the CPPCC functions , it is necessary to give full play to the characteristics of the motions which are extensive in contents , require a high degree of participation , are handled according to set regulations , and require replies from the relevant administrative units .  The motion work should be closely combined with the inspection activities and special committee meetings of the CPPCC committee members .  
We should hasten to suit these requirements through structural changes in various aspects , and move toward internationalization by merging with the international prevailing standards as soon as possible in terms of the improvement and perfection of administrative and management structure , foreign economic and trade structure , and service system and the concrete operation of agreement negotiations , project examination and approval , interest distributions , and contract fulfillment .

Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .

Once public consciousness has been raised to a new level , then hand-in-hand , with heads held high and chests thrust forward , all the citizens of China can join in the march to the future .

Salute to the 21st Century " . A copy of the report was given to each legislator at the time of the administrative report . .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep . It will take time and a good civil service system to build up the concept and image of administrative neutrality .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed .

Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold .

Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy .

In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . . The remaining few percent is up for grabs among public health , agriculture , social welfare , religious , and other interests , naturally leading to the " squeezing out " effect .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .

Some place blame on errors made by the incoming administration - - poor discipline among the troops or bad economic policy . Some think it was due to a conspiracy among Taiwanese communists at that time , who took advantage of the situation to drive society into chaos . Some scholars theorize that with two different systems separated for such a long period of time , once reunited , a crisis of adjustment was inevitable . But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside .

In looking toward all of the preparations for the handover , those relating to government-including the establishment of the Basic Law and the holding of elections , the building of the airport , and even the appointment of the special administrative region 's chief executive and the arrival of the People 's Liberation Army-all have been accomplished .

Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media .

In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .

Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes .

Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .

In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .

By the time these cities see an economic takeoff , it is appropriate that the factories in Hong Kong implement its active investment plans , and move their factories which are originally concentrated in southern China to the areas along the Chang Jiang or in the western regions where wages and land prices are comparatively lower , so as to occupy the commanding height .  China is gradually accelerating its efforts of opening up to the outside world .  Hong Kong is a special administrative region under the " one country , two systems . "  
He stressed in particular : Law has entrusted to the various provincial ( regional , municipal ) governments the duty of ensuring the total area of farmland in their own administrative areas does not decrease .  This should be made an important index for assessing local party and government leaderships so that it will become a conscious action of leading cadres at all levels .  
He hoped that friends of the industrial and commercial circles will continue to exert a positive influence , support the administration of the government of the special administrative region headed by Mr .

7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
Responsible official of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission stressed today that all party committees , governments , and discipline inspection and supervisory organs should strengthen the supervision over the behaviors of enterprise leading cadres in doing operational and managerial activities , should earnestly implement the relevant regulations on the responsibility system for building party style and administrative honesty , and should resolutely investigate and deal with without any lenient behaviors that have caused tremendous losses to the state due to duty dereliction .

2 .  Making administrative affairs transparent is a key link to promoting legal administration , realizing the basic plan for ruling the country according to law , and building a socialist country ruled by law .  
Making administrative affairs transparent , setting up a set of standards and mechanisms to restrict the use of powers , and making the use of powers transparent are channels through which the broad masses of the people are able to directly supervise the performances of the government in the most extensive manner .  Administrative transparency is not only conducive to supervising leading cadres but it can also provide a systematic guarantee for preventing " secret operations " and abuse of powers .

As for the affairs that can not be resolved in line with market mechanism but still need go through procedures of government examinations and approvals , we should scientifically divide powers , set up strict interactive supervisory and restraint mechanisms , and prevent a small number of people or individuals from abuse of powers .  We should improve collective policymaking mechanisms and hold collective discussions to decide the affairs that are related to the personal interests of the people strictly according to the principle of democratic centralism .  Making administrative affairs transparent is not a goal .

So , it is necessary to make evaluation , investigation of responsibility , and division of work into a coordinate process .  At present , prominent attention should be paid to major economic losses , serious accidents , and serious incidents cropping up due to leading cadres ' failure in improving party style and administrative honesty .  We should find out who is to blame for long-lasting serious unhealthy trends and investigate leading cadres ' spouses and children who abuse leading cadres ' functions and influential power to obtain unlawful benefits and to create bad influence .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .

This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep .

Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold .

Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy .

In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level .

At present 25% of the national budget goes for defense and the military ; 20% goes toward economic development ; routine government administrative costs account for 10% ; 15% is applied to education . . . .

But whatever the causes , Chen Yi , as the highest ranking administrative official , can not deny responsibility .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside .

Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature .

In this regard , the Commission may address the insufficient political acceptability of economic instruments ; difficulties in the design of economic instruments ; administrative difficulties with economic instruments ; conflicts between environmental and other policy objectives ; anxiety about repercussions on the international competitiveness of the national economy ; and adverse economic and structural conditions that the application of economic instruments may encounter .

Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .

The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
In this connection , it is appropriate to take into account the diversity of situations prevailing in each country in economic , social , cultural and political terms to appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative apparatus and then perhaps to suggest adjustments , since there can not be just one analytical criterion or just one model for good administration .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .

The mechanisms must have a unified and clearly defined command and control structure ensuring the orderly and effective discharge of the mandate assigned to them , and precise coordination of the political , military , humanitarian , civilian and administrative components of any activity must be ensured ;  
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .

Unless immediate steps are taken by the parties concerned for example , through the removal of administrative and legal barriers one of the most important provisions of the Peace Agreement will remain unfulfilled , with grave political and economic consequences for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina .

While the administrative restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights fell within the scope of the Fifth Committee , it was the task of the Third Committee to study the restructuring of policy , ensuring that emphasis was placed on economic , social and cultural rights , which were being neglected because priority was still being accorded to civil and political rights .

In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency .

Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .
