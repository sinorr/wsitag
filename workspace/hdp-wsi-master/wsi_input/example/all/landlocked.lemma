In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,

Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .

The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;

Recommendation 2 .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
The main aim of IATA , the global airline trade association with a membership of 257 carriers , of which 18 are based in landlocked developing countries is to promote safe , reliable and secure services and to develop collaboration among airlines and cooperation with ICAO . 
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest .  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .

As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .

Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , including through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Also invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in close cooperation with the regional economic commissions , within their respective mandates and current resources , as well as with other relevant international organizations , to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .

Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
Because of the many obstacles that developing landlocked countries faced in international trade , especially high transport costs which made their exports expensive and less competitive , special attention should be given to the interests of those countries in the next round of trade negotiations .  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Invites the international community to continue to provide technical and financial support to landlocked and transit developing countries to assist with effective implementation of their cooperation agreements and arrangements on transit transport , taking into account that many landlocked and transit developing countries have concluded bilateral and regional arrangements and are making efforts to implement them ;  
Invites Member States , members of the specialized agencies and United Nations observers , including , inter alia , landlocked and transit developing countries and donor countries , and international financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions to participate in the international ministerial meeting and its preparatory process ;  
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 2003 , within existing resources for the biennium 2003-2004 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to serve as a preparatory committee for the international ministerial meeting referred to in paragraph 10 above in order to provide it with substantive preparation ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Invites the international community to continue to provide technical and financial support to landlocked and transit developing countries to assist with effective implementation of their cooperation agreements and arrangements on transit transport , taking into account that many landlocked and transit developing countries have concluded bilateral and regional arrangements and are making efforts to implement them ;  
Invites Member States , members of the specialized agencies and United Nations observers , including , inter alia , landlocked and transit developing countries and donor countries , and international financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to participate in the International Ministerial Meeting and its preparatory process ;  
In this connection , the statement is also lacking as to how the operational capacity of the organizations and bodies of the system , in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , will be enhanced in their activities aimed at supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries and small island developing States ( see operative para . 3 of draft resolution A / C . 2 / 56 / L . 78 ) .  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
A careful balance must be maintained between , on the one hand , establishing priorities to make the best use of resources and avoid waste , and on the other hand the principle of adequate provision for alternatives as insurance against even the remote possibility of future political , monopoly , regulatory or efficiency difficulties on any of the main transit transport routes available to landlocked countries .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Further , the precise content of the freedom of transit has in each single case to be agreed upon by the transit State and the landlocked State concerned , and in the absence of agreement concerning the terms and modalities for exercising the right of access of persons and goods , transit through the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany is regulated only by national law , in particular with regard to ways and means of transport and the use of traffic infrastructure .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;

The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;

In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
Growth was still constrained by a number of factors common to many LDCs , including poor physical and institutional infrastructure , aggravated by the landlocked nature of his country , low levels of human resource development and a high incidence of poverty .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
The main aim of IATA , the global airline trade association with a membership of 257 carriers , of which 18 are based in landlocked developing countries is to promote safe , reliable and secure services and to develop collaboration among airlines and cooperation with ICAO . 
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest .  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .

As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .

Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , including through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Also invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in close cooperation with the regional economic commissions , within their respective mandates and current resources , as well as with other relevant international organizations , to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .

Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
Because of the many obstacles that developing landlocked countries faced in international trade , especially high transport costs which made their exports expensive and less competitive , special attention should be given to the interests of those countries in the next round of trade negotiations .  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Invites the international community to continue to provide technical and financial support to landlocked and transit developing countries to assist with effective implementation of their cooperation agreements and arrangements on transit transport , taking into account that many landlocked and transit developing countries have concluded bilateral and regional arrangements and are making efforts to implement them ;  
Invites Member States , members of the specialized agencies and United Nations observers , including , inter alia , landlocked and transit developing countries and donor countries , and international financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions to participate in the international ministerial meeting and its preparatory process ;  
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 2003 , within existing resources for the biennium 2003-2004 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to serve as a preparatory committee for the international ministerial meeting referred to in paragraph 10 above in order to provide it with substantive preparation ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Invites the international community to continue to provide technical and financial support to landlocked and transit developing countries to assist with effective implementation of their cooperation agreements and arrangements on transit transport , taking into account that many landlocked and transit developing countries have concluded bilateral and regional arrangements and are making efforts to implement them ;  
Invites Member States , members of the specialized agencies and United Nations observers , including , inter alia , landlocked and transit developing countries and donor countries , and international financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to participate in the International Ministerial Meeting and its preparatory process ;  
In this connection , the statement is also lacking as to how the operational capacity of the organizations and bodies of the system , in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , will be enhanced in their activities aimed at supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries and small island developing States ( see operative para . 3 of draft resolution A / C . 2 / 56 / L . 78 ) .
