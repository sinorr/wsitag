Because the leadership posts at the county and city level are also schools to foster outstanding leadership talent , and because counties and cities have complete functions just as " the sparrow may be small but it has all the vital organs , " the posts are the most suitable places to temper cadres ; a considerable number of senior and medium-level leading cadres have grown to maturity after being tempered at such posts .  
He said : During the past 20 years , the economic exchange and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have steadily developed and continuously grown in quality and quantity , and the contacts of people and activities of social and cultural intercourse have been increasingly frequent , thus initially forming a pattern of mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development of the economies of the two localities .  
The above facts show that Shenzhen has rapidly grown from a small border town to a modern city in a short period of 20 years , an essential factor of which is attributable to our party 's policy decision on the construction of Shenzhen and the creative practice of the vast numbers of cadres and masses that represent the demands of the development of advanced social productive forces .

Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
The track of Hu Changqing 's downfall once again warns us that because of the long-time environment of peaceful construction and the ever-improving living conditions , some people have grown indolent and have developed hedonistic tendencies and are harboring thoughts of loose living and idleness .  This is the main reason for the rampant corruption today .  
Over the past few years , the North and the South have conducted nongovernmental economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other which have grown more dynamic with each passing day .

China today is still a developing country with 1.25 billion people .  Our economic foundation is still fragile .  Although our national strength has grown somewhat , I am afraid that we can not reach the level of an intermediate developed country until the middle of the 21st century .  
As China 's population has grown , the quality of people 's living standards has improved , economic and social development has quickened , and industrialization , urbanization , and agricultural modernization have speeded up , China 's water resources situation has become even worse , and contradictions between water supply and demand are becoming even more prominent .  So we must soberly realize the water problem .  
It is precisely because the United Nations has observed the purpose of the charter in safeguarding peace , developing friendship , and promoting cooperation and the norms of international relations - - with equality of sovereignty and mutual noninterference in internal affairs as the core - - that the United Nations has continually developed and grown over the past 55 years , increasing its member states from 51 to 189 , and plays an irreplaceable role in world affairs .  
After studying Cheng Kejie 's case , Hu Changqing 's case , and some other typical cases , we have found that they shared some common characteristics : They had economically grown insatiably avaricious and had become corrupt and degenerate in their daily life .  
Besides , thanks to economic responsibility auditing , the leading cadres have cultivated a stronger sense of responsibility and a stronger sense of self-restriction and have grown more conscious in being strict with themselves while performing official duties and those who take over leading posts have also learned both experiences and lessons from their predecessors and have thus avoided making the same mistakes .  
In the last 12 years since the establishment of their diplomatic relations , bilateral relations have developed smoothly , high-level leaders have carried out mutual visits frequently , and bilateral trade has grown in a sustained manner .

The rapid reduction in the sweet potato crop reflects two phenomena : First , the movement of the rural population to the cities . Even though the sweet potato does not require much care , its planting and harvesting still require lots of manpower . Second , although many poor-land fields were left unused , in rice-growing areas some paddy fields are used for both rice and sweet potatoes to make the most of natural conditions . Sweet potatoes can be grown between the two growing periods of paddy rice , getting full use out of a field .  
Its fruit , however , has earned a place in the hearts and appetites of Chinese everywhere for its many gastronomic and medicinal uses .

After September of each year , the northeast seasonal winds are very strong , causing much of the soil to be blown away , and exposing the sandstone layer . In addition to the lack of humus , the soil is extremely poor and barren . Although 55 percent of the island is suitable for planting , yet due to economic inefficiency , mostly peanuts and corn are grown .  
It does n't mean that this area is ideal for the ducks - - only that suitable places are getting fewer and fewer , " Fang Wei-hung says . Kuantu used to be another major resting place for the ducks , too , but the tidewater belt there has been gradually grown over by mangroves , and the ducks have been disturbed by increased fishing boat traffic . And the number of seasonal birds that appear at Lanyang Creek near Ilan has declined over the years because of overzealous hunters and fishermen .  
Ho Te-hong , Chairman of the Forestry BureauThe Taiwan Forestry Bureau is like the eldest brother or sister in a family who earned money to support their younger brothers or sisters . And after their living standard improved , the younger brothers and sisters , now having grown up , turn around and reject their elder brother or sister , viewing them as good-for nothings or saying that their former jobs were not prestigious enough . When our nation was poor the Taiwan Forestry Bureau struggled to keep our heads above water .  
The cherry tree has already grown leaves under the heat of the scorching sun . The strong life is lifted high into the air in distinct stages . The result is just as I thought it would be . The tree is not the least bit shy or timid - - even so as to spread in every direction .  
Some five or six years ago a miniature variety appeared of poinsettia , a plant whose gorgeous red blooms flower around Christmas time , enabling it to be brought in from the garden and grown as an indoor potted plant .

Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan .

But in earlier years , the Pu'er produced in Yunnan was not aged enough , its taste was n't smooth , and its grade was n't high . Most people did n't know that Pu'er , unlike the teas grown in Taiwan , does n't like to be sealed up and should from time to time be brought out and aired . Otherwise , in a hot and humid climate , it easily molds and rots , making it quite literally a " stinky , moldy tea . "  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
The tradition of " eight treasures " Since the Chou Dynasty the Chinese have developed a roster of the " eight most excellent treasures , " dishes which satisfy delicate and exquisite tastes . Favored delicacies have differed from era to era , such as bear paws , swiftlet nests , monkey brains , ape lips and camel humps . Because the number of choice dishes has grown larger and larger , the list has been more precisely divided into four categories of " eight treasures " : mammals , seafood , poultry , and vegetables .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things .

Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
The best-known exported China teas are Lapsang Souchong , which is a Wuyi souchong black tea which is smoked with pine smoke during drying , giving it an aroma of pine resin ; Congou , a carefully processed black souchong leaf tea grown at lower altitudes in the Wuyi mountains ; Pekoe ( meaning " white down " ) , named for the downy young bud tips used ; and Gunpowder ( zhucha , meaning " pearl tea " ) which is rolled into small round balls like pearls .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years .

The saying goes that " tangerines grown beyond the Huai River are small and dry . " Tangerines and oranges need the humid climate and fertile soils of the south to produce fragrant , sweet and juicy fruits . If they are transplanted north of the Huai River ( which flows West to East halfway between the Yangtze and the Yellow River ) , the soil and climate do n't suit them , and they only produce dry and undersized fruits .  
Of ' Mui 's twin sons Huegu ( Chang Hui-kuo ) and ' Api , the one plays guitar to a professional standard , and the other has been described as an excellent singer ever since he was in elementary school . Once he was grown up , ' Api was hired by several tourist " culture villages " in Hualien County as a singing and dancing instructor . He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
" At the Harvest Festival , when you put on your betel nut bag , it means you are grown up , and at this kind of social occasion grown-up Ami girls will place betel nuts and liquor inside the betel nut pouch of the man they like best .

" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
Referring to the scope of this year 's TIBE , which again is setting new records , GIO Director-General Arthur Iap remarked at a press conference just before the opening that he was happy to see that the exhibit was unaffected by the economic situation and that TIBE had grown from an initial eleven participating countries and 295 booths to what it has become today . It was , he said , the fruit of the continuing efforts of the publishing industry and a symbol of the growing interconnectedness of Taiwan with the international community .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
It will still take a long time to establish just what specific curative effects alternative therapies have .

Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody . After the foundation started funding Paling Elementary School , a school in Taoyuan County attended by Aboriginal children , that school 's website soon took first place in a nationwide contest and even became an outlet for online sales of the peaches grown on Lala Mountain , thus helping to spearhead local economic development .

Just as famous as their green onions are their sand leeks , although they can only be grown over the two or three months of winter . With the abundant rainfall of the plain , the leeks , too , grow large and well proportioned . Their scent is pungent and their flavor strong , which makes them well suited to the different styles of cooking around Taiwan , and for the past few years they have been a Chinese New Year staple throughout the Taipei area .  
Language initially posed a problem , because these children , having grown up in Germany , whether of mixed German-Chinese parentage or pure Chinese , were not necessarily very competent in Chinese , with levels of ability differing widely . The teachers brought over from Taiwan , on the other hand , could n't speak German .

But in the last few years , with dramatic changes in the political environment , skyrocketing property prices , massive stock market swings , political graft financed by money-laden conglomerates , and an unstable labor market , workers ' " sense of comparative exploitedness " has grown ever more acute , and their mood has become far more volatile . "  
In recent years organically grown vegetables have become increasingly popular . " Wild " veggies , grown without depending on man-made fertilizers and not using pesticides , fit right in with this trend . Add to this the common belief that bitter tasting foods have medicinal value , and wild vegetables have become a new favorite for health-minded modern people .  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
But a human race that has lost contact with tradition would be like an orchid cut off from its roots . That would leave an unfillable void at the heart of life . The cold feeling of alienation that has grown up in our urban civilization makes itself obvious to us in many ways . Fortunately , not everyone is seduced by our glittering society .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
Fully grown maroon orioles are fierce birds with few natural enemies , and they generally feed in mixed flocks with other bird species . But in the breeding season their chicks are much coveted by snakes , squirrels , crows and sparrowhawks , and an attack will often prompt the sensitive parent birds to abandon the nest they have built .  
For instance , 40 years ago , after Chinese-American scientists Yang Chen-ning and Lee Tsung-dao received a Nobel physics prize , there was a boom in the popularity of physics courses . For the last five or six years law departments have consistently topped the rankings in Category 1 , but although the demand for legally qualified personnel has grown thanks to Taiwan 's progress towards the rule of law , the number of universities with law departments has increased too , making competition between law graduates more intense than before .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
Referring to the scope of this year 's TIBE , which again is setting new records , GIO Director-General Arthur Iap remarked at a press conference just before the opening that he was happy to see that the exhibit was unaffected by the economic situation and that TIBE had grown from an initial eleven participating countries and 295 booths to what it has become today . It was , he said , the fruit of the continuing efforts of the publishing industry and a symbol of the growing interconnectedness of Taiwan with the international community .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
It will still take a long time to establish just what specific curative effects alternative therapies have . But since the former Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health was expanded into a " national center " in 1998 , its annual research budget has grown hugely , from US $ 2 million then to US $ 150 million today .  
Forging ahead as newlyweds , our only saving grace ended up being our roots . The wedding ceremony , here in the States , was what you would call a " traditional Western ceremony , " complete with a small white church , limousine and long white wedding grown . Benjamin survived that part just fine but it was the reception I worried about , as that 's when my Italian heritage truly blossomed .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody . After the foundation started funding Paling Elementary School , a school in Taoyuan County attended by Aboriginal children , that school 's website soon took first place in a nationwide contest and even became an outlet for online sales of the peaches grown on Lala Mountain , thus helping to spearhead local economic development .

" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings . On the contrary , she 'll keep this coolly to herself until the individual has acquired the needed courage , until the patient 's timid spirit has grown strong enough , " Lu Su-chen , art therapy consultant for the Student Counseling Center of National Tsing Hua University , has written .  
Just as famous as their green onions are their sand leeks , although they can only be grown over the two or three months of winter . With the abundant rainfall of the plain , the leeks , too , grow large and well proportioned . Their scent is pungent and their flavor strong , which makes them well suited to the different styles of cooking around Taiwan , and for the past few years they have been a Chinese New Year staple throughout the Taipei area .  
Language initially posed a problem , because these children , having grown up in Germany , whether of mixed German-Chinese parentage or pure Chinese , were not necessarily very competent in Chinese , with levels of ability differing widely . The teachers brought over from Taiwan , on the other hand , could n't speak German . Yet , while verbal communication was only intermittently successful , the subjects involved mainly " do what I do " types of activities , so the language problem did not prove too serious .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
In particular , since the 1970s , with universal education and the rise of individualism and feminist consciousness , the younger generations have grown accustomed to living for themselves , and are wary of entering the " trap " of marriage ; while factors such as extramarital affairs , infertility and mental illness , along with changing employment patterns due to global competition , leave those who do marry in a constant state of anxiety , never knowing when the citadel they have toiled to build may collapse around them .  
On some tours , as well as birdwatching and learning about coastal plants , tourists also ride out to the tidal zones to see how oysters are raised and collected . At low tide , they enjoy the sight of crabs digging their holes , and visit ponds where hard clams are grown . Later , as the tide rises , they return to the shore to enjoy magnificent views of the sea over the now-submerged oyster beds .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
There used to be a craftswoman in Chiayi who specialized in making these fans . When she died about 20 years ago the craft was lost , but demand for the fans has grown along with the numbers of the troupes performing . Hence , Chen studied how to make them , and after 20 years of intense research has become the undisputed leading maker of these fans .  
Many formal sector firms , private and public , have grown accustomed to protected markets , discriminatory administrative procedures and controlled banking practices , and have problems adjusting to free markets .  
Because we live in that kind of economy a key part of our action to deal with the problems of development must , accordingly , be multilateral , and the key problem facing us , both multilaterally and in our bilateral , donor roles , is that within the global economy the gap between rich and poor countries , despite all efforts to resist this , has grown .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
However , the threats of a world cataclysm have grown over decades of regional and local conflicts , stirred up by a wide range of motives involving geopolitical , economic and trading disputes as well as ethnic and religious conflicts .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
That volume , which was fixed by the international community in the 1970s at 0.7 per cent of the GNP of the developed countries , has so far been attained by only four countries .  It should nevertheless be noted that appeals for official development assistance have become more and more pressing and numerous as needs - especially those of the least developed countries , which have steadily increased in number - have grown .  
That is why , having studied the Secretary-General 's very informative report , my delegation feels that the dividing line between respect for and violation of the Abuja Agreement has grown so tenuous that , given its particular urgency , the situation in Liberia requires renewed thoughtful consideration rather than hasty or improvised measures .  
Since its creation in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 182 , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat has grown into an effective facilitator for the coordination of both natural and complex emergencies , and has increased its capacity to act as an advocate of humanitarian assistance in the context of both political and humanitarian policy discussions , and with respect to resource mobilization for humanitarian emergencies . 
In Brazil , for example , the National Confederation of Health-care Cooperatives ( Unimed do Brasil ) has grown from a single cooperative set up in 1967 to a business complex now comprising 304 provider-owned health cooperatives , many owning hospitals , organized in 17 State-level networks , and a national holding company that owns subsidiaries in insurance and provides bulk purchasing and common services for members ' hospitals and clinics ; data management and communications ; and training , research and development .

With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .

It is most unfortunate that as soon as the fear of a global crisis waned , people settled for cosmetic changes and repeated the stale old platitudes about how , in due time , freely fluctuating exchange rates would bring a stability of sorts to the system ; this , notwithstanding the fact that there has been almost three decades of constant volatility since that policy was adopted and a string of crises that have grown ever more intensive and destructive . 
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .

A veritable industrial complex based on forced labour had grown up in the prisons , and the whites responsible for brutal crimes such as the murder of African immigrant Amadou Diallo went unpunished .  
Moreover there is the danger that by increasing the inequalities between rich and poor countries , globalization may render the exercise of the most elementary and fundamental human rights illusory in the least developed countries , whose numbers have grown steadily since 1990 and whose economic situation has steadily deteriorated , further pauperizing a population already sorely tried by various disasters .  
Yet now , in contradiction to the remarks we have grown accustomed to hearing against those whom you accuse of dictatorship and authoritarian rule , we are seeing dozens of emergency measures and laws being adopted by the Governments of Western States , first and foremost the United States , as a result of a single painful event that has befallen them .  Do you realize , distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen , how many painful events have befallen the countries and peoples you have been accusing of being undemocratic ?
