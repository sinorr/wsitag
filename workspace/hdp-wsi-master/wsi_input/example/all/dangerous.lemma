"  
Today , the economy of the mainland motherland is growing , and the country is enjoying a stronger comprehensive national strength and an enhanced international status ; and under such circumstances , dangerous remarks , actions , and attempts on the island , which were frustrated in the past , will not have their way now and will never have their way in the future .  
Liu Guangyou , a senior submarine officer who had fought on the sea for 30 years , clearly understood that after a ten-odd-day long voyage , the bearing capabilities of both the equipment and the crew had reached the limits .  So , staying longer for another one minute under water would be several dozen times more dangerous than the ordinary times .  
The other day the " Los Angeles Times " published a signed article entitled " Still Important to Accept China , " stating that those who were opposed to contact with China did not approve of giving China permanent normal trade relation status , and that " this is taking a very reckless attitude toward critical U.S . interests " and is an " extremely dangerous " game .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .

They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .

If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .

In its editorial entitled " Serious Consequences of US Arms Sales to Taiwan , " Wen Wei Po pointed out that it is both wrong and dangerous for the United States to be continuously selling arms and equipment to Taiwan , especially when the weapons sold are more and more sophisticated and the sums involved are larger and larger .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
However , such suppression has also increased the national sentiment on the mainland , thus preventing its internal moderate forces from gaining ground , and isolation may even lead to dangerous rash actions .  Taiwan may become the victim of the international power struggle .  This is the most pressing crisis to Taiwan at present .

For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .  Therefore , it was not included among the items to be converted to actual use .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
By using force against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia , US-led NATO had not only seriously violated the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law and set an extremely dangerous example of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries , but had also further complicated the situation in the region .

3 .  Railway , civil aviation , and transportation departments and enterprises should take resolute steps to stop the operation of any transportation vehicles that have mechanical problems .  In addition , the phenomena of violating safety regulations , such as over-loading , over-speeding , and violation of traffic regulations , should be resolutely stopped .  Passengers who carry with them flammable , explosive , poisonous , and dangerous articles should be strictly inspected .  They should be prohibited from taking transportation vehicles so as to ensure transportation safety .

The most common problem is the blocking of fire exits , which is extremely dangerous .  
Ambassador Li said , certain American politicians are still interfering in China 's internal affairs with regard to issues such as Tibet , religion , and human rights , or else pursuing double standards , and preaching the " theory of the China threat " heedless of the facts ; this is particularly harmful and dangerous .

The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .

In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
Asia is their homeAs an object of research , the tawny fish owl is less dangerous than the Formosan black bear , and not as rare as the now extinct clouded leopard . The tawny fish owl is found in India , mainland China and Taiwan , but in the almost 20 years that birdwatching has been popular in Taiwan , this owl has been sighted very few times , and has always been regarded as rare .  
From October to April , during the season of northeast rains , on the east and north coasts of Green Island the typical scene is of stormy seas , dark reefs and waves chipping away at the cliff walls . At this time the soft coral dwindles and large fish that move in giant schools grow in number . On the slopes of the reef , you can see fierce jackfish and sharks that grow nearly a meter long cruising about slowly . It 's dangerous and exciting .  
Naturally he does not exclude the possibility that some of these ships were brought to grief by Penghu 's strong winds and treacherous waters . For example , when exploring the tiny 1,000-meter-square island of Hsienchiao ( which means " dangerous coral reef " ) , he found an astounding amount of Yuan and Ming period potsherds . " It seems obvious that ships were wrecked here , " he concludes .  
Not enough to go around " Although halfway houses can not completely replace the juvenile detention facilities , they can provide the authorities with another option in handling youthful offenders , " says legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , who is very familiar with the juvenile justice system .

Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year .

My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .

By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
The dangerous stability of mutual assured destruction has been replaced by a less fearsome , but more uncertain and unstable , multipolar world , a world in rapid transition to an unknown destination .  
It is a fact that we have made a rather substantial advance in our thinking on specific disarmament issues and that we have moved across the dangerous line of confrontation towards a more complex labyrinth in which the options for greater progress are broad and open .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
The continuing political impasse in the Liberian peace process is a sign of a dangerous trend , also manifested in the Liberian parties ' disregard of the numerous appeals issued by the international community and by African regional organizations , in particular the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , and of the vigorous efforts aimed at the speedy achievement of a political settlement in that country .

A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
The Government of Iraq , guided by paragraph 31 of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights , which states that food and medicine should not be used as a tool for political pressure , looks to the United Nations and its humanitarian organizations to study the grave political , legal and humanitarian consequences of the imposition of the economic embargo , requesting that a mechanism should be sought to minimize those consequences and their dangerous repercussions on all human rights . 
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .

are both in blatant violation of universally accepted norms and principles governing relations among nations and create dangerous precedents with unpredictable yet grave consequences detrimental to the cause of the rule of law and international peace and security .  
we have indicated in the past , we consider the insistence of American officials on repeating unsubstantiated and undocumented allegations that have already been proven fictitious as a matter of utmost irresponsibility and a serious and dangerous mistake , the continuation of which will have destructive repercussions for international relations and will create a climate of suspicion and distrust .

Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
Further evidence of this is the dangerous , irresponsible , uncontrolled and unregulated intrusion of this organization 's aircraft , for purposes other than providing air service , into a zone of significant international civil aviation activity and one of the most active international air corridors of the western hemisphere .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
This is because their genuine efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region have in recent months met with grave and hostile incidents provoked by the occupying Power with an aggressive and dangerous policy that threatens the course of the peace process in the region .  It is common knowledge that all of this is possible thanks to the support Israel continues to receive from the United States , which has never concealed its determination to veto in the Security Council any resolution that contains firm statements against Israel 's conduct in the Middle East .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
Protection of the atmosphere , in regard to : ( i ) absorption of greenhouse gases ; ( ii ) climate change and its potentially drastic effects on marine living resources ; ( iii ) energy optimization programmes and reduction of dangerous substances in exhaust gas emissions ; and ( iv ) reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in at-sea and coastal ocean industries ; ( g ) Chapter 10 .  
On 13 July 1995 , aircraft of " Brothers to the Rescue " penetrated over Cuban territorial waters north of our capital , entered prohibited zone MU-P1 and overflew over the city at very low altitude , dropping leaflets and behaving in a dangerous and careless manner .  
The Council recognized that it continued to be a widespread international activity frequently involving highly organized international syndicates that trafficked in human cargo without regard to the dangerous and inhumane conditions to which they were subjected , and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards .  
The Moroccan delegation 's initiative sought to impose a singular , selective , partisan and tendentious interpretation of the reports of the Secretary-General and to accept it would have set an unfortunate and dangerous precedent .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
However , under Rule 644 ( i ) , " No convicted prisoner inside the prison other than a camp or temporary prison shall be fettered except on the ground that he is violent , dangerous or had escaped or attempted to escape " .  
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Rabbi Cooper also stated that materials that were illegal in most other democratic countries , including those deemed dangerous , racist or defamatory under the laws of those countries , could be posted on the Internet in the United States , thereby becoming accessible to virtually everyone around the globe , regardless of national legislation .  
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
The illicit traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes can assume various forms , the principal characteristic being the ability of the persons engaged therein to adapt to the changing international situation .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Aggravated rape is rape accompanied by threat of murder or by serious injury or committed by a person with a record of previous rape conviction and especially aggravated rape is rape accomplished by a group of persons or by an especially dangerous recidivist or entailing especially grave consequences and also rape of a minor ;  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
In its general debate , the Committee had further included a reference to all those activities that were dangerous or harmful to the child 's physical , mental and spiritual development or were liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child .  
A complete revised set of recommended provisions concerning the design , construction , inspection , testing and approval of portable tanks ( tank-containers ) intended for the transport of liquid and solid dangerous substances , non-refrigerated liquefied gases , and refrigerated liquefied gases was elaborated .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The most dangerous agricultural pest , the pink mealy bug , is being controlled by bio-control agents a hybrid beetle and a parasitic wasp .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
This initiative is designed to deal with the various facets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation , which besides draining vast resources that could be devoted to the social and economic development of our peoples constitutes the most dangerous threat to the peace and security of the world .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
The Metro Manila city and town mayors have agreed to pursue a common resettlement site for their respective urban poor constituents who need to be relocated because they are occupying dangerous zones and critical areas for government infrastructure projects .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
It was even more dangerous when information imbalances were accompanied by aggressive policies which violated independence and national sovereignty ; Cuba continued to be the target of radio and television attacks by the Government of the United States of America in open defiance of the elementary norms of coexistence among States and the principles of international law , and despite repeated condemnation by specialized bodies and forums .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
But what makes the terrorism rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous is that the terrorists invoke a distorted , twisted and fanatic interpretation of Islam , which is very distant from enlightened Islam . We have no quarrel with Islam . 
We , the representatives of the international community , can not , at this historical juncture , ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory that runs counter to the common work and collective obligations we agreed upon for international life .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Other examples included an ad hoc tribunal to investigate allegations of improper supply or prescription of dangerous drugs and a national reference laboratory to undertake research on controlled substances and the applicable international controls .  
. . .  This destructive process has been hastened by the close links that have been established among the armed groups , the armies of losers , which proliferate throughout central Africa , and of which the former Rwandan government forces are the most violent , well armed , well organized and dangerous ( para .  91 ) .  
The law provided a framework for improving their status , but it was unevenly implemented because of ingrained cultural attitudes ; large segments of rural and urban society still resorted to customary laws in regard to marriage and divorce and dangerous traditional practices , such as circumcision , continued to prevail in many areas .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
A dangerous precedent has been set for the revival of the policy of imposing ones will by force , and the entire modern international legal order has been jeopardized .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
At its special session , the General Assembly recognized that the problem of climate change is one of the biggest challenges that will face the world in the twenty-first century , and stated that the ultimate goal , shared by all countries , was to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
No firm decision as regards a possible future four-year periodicity of amendments should be taken during the period of alignment of the format of the various legal instruments concerning modal aspects of the transport of dangerous goods on that of the model regulations , and pending decisions regarding the implementation of the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals in accordance with Agenda 21 objectives ;  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
When it is required to ensure liquid dangerous goods remain in their intended orientation , package orientation labels meeting the specifications of ISO 780:1985 shall be affixed on at least two opposite vertical sides with the arrows pointing in the correct direction .  
The Recommendation enumerates the factors to be taken into account in determining the types of hazardous work , for example , work which exposes children to physical , psychological or sexual abuse ; work underground , or at dangerous heights ; work with dangerous machinery ; and work in an unhealthy environment .  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
It would be particularly dangerous , under the pretext of exorcising painful emotions or absolving the international community of its past inaction or its inability now and in the future to prevent or settle crises , to risk acting without the consent of a State , or even against its desire , with excesses as serious as regrettable endangering the collective security system so painstakingly built around the Security Council .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
It should be remembered that the national legislation of most countries established regimes of absolute liability for the cases covered by the draft articles , in other words for acts which were lawful but dangerous , which were tolerated because they had beneficial effects for society as a whole , even if they could in fact cause damage to private persons .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
Unfortunately , we all know that the commitments undertaken in the Convention were not sufficient to meet its ultimate objective , which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
The Committee calls on the Government to cease and prevent , in law and in practice , all forms of social , economic and physical violence and discrimination against women and children , especially the continuous , degrading and dangerous practice of female genital mutilation .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In the press release she published herself on 19 June , at the end of her visit , the Special Rapporteur endorsed this appeal and emphasized the vital nature of preventive action at national , regional and international level to halt the illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which seriously threatened the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
Article 56 of the law states that " To produce , process , package , import , export , trade , supply , transport , store , keep , have in warehouse or use products or substances that are toxic , dangerous or noxious to human health or to the environment , contrary to the requirements established in laws or regulations " entails a prison sentence ranging from one to four years and a fine .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
With reference to Paraguay , the Special Rapporteur points out that at the end of her visit to the country , she issued an appeal in which she stressed the importance of preventive measures at national , regional and international level in order to halt the illegal dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which is a serious threat to the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
The Kuwaiti Government ' s policy to weaken Iraq , which is faced with a virulent American-Zionist campaign owing to its nationalist positions in defence of Arab rights , is motivated by selfish considerations , a narrow vision and goals about which the least one can say is that they are suspect and dangerous . "  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
Likewise , new safety and environmental standards impose on building owners major obligations to retrofit existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , handicap access , interior air quality , asbestos abatement , shielding of electromagnetic fields , elimination of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) compounds , and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
The short term is the timehorizon of markets and market economies , focused as they are on financial markets , quick profits and ways of surviving and expanding in an environment perceived as precarious and dangerous .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
The existing system , which relies on unpredictable and piecemeal funding and outdated , cumbersome and complex procedures is simply not suited for the difficult and dangerous situations in which United Nations personnel are obliged to work .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
We are convinced that the absence of such dialogue , against the backdrop of social tension and a very difficult economic situation , could have the most dangerous consequences for the future of post-conflict recovery in the Central African Republic , and could lead to a situation in which the results of the international communitys efforts over the past few years would be lost and reduced to naught .  
Despite Afghanistans slide into chaos in recent years , and the dangerous and destabilizing implications that that has had for the subregion and elsewhere , the international community still has an essential moral duty not to condemn the entire Afghan people for the mistakes of an authority that has been isolated within the country and has made enemies of much of the rest of the world by turning that country into a base camp for an international terrorist network .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Urge States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Urges States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
This campaign , which is being conducted in grave and flagrant violation of signed commitments reached between Israel and the Palestinian leadership , and which represents a dangerous departure from the spirit and the letter of the Middle East peace process , is the direct result of the relentless incitement in the official Palestinian media , the collusion between the Palestinian leadership and recognized terrorist groups , and the release of scores of terrorists from Palestinian prisons . 
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours . 
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Today , the economy of the mainland motherland is growing , and the country is enjoying a stronger comprehensive national strength and an enhanced international status ; and under such circumstances , dangerous remarks , actions , and attempts on the island , which were frustrated in the past , will not have their way now and will never have their way in the future .  
Liu Guangyou , a senior submarine officer who had fought on the sea for 30 years , clearly understood that after a ten-odd-day long voyage , the bearing capabilities of both the equipment and the crew had reached the limits .  So , staying longer for another one minute under water would be several dozen times more dangerous than the ordinary times .  
The other day the " Los Angeles Times " published a signed article entitled " Still Important to Accept China , " stating that those who were opposed to contact with China did not approve of giving China permanent normal trade relation status , and that " this is taking a very reckless attitude toward critical U.S . interests " and is an " extremely dangerous " game .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
The barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia by the US-led NATO forces over 78 days from March to June 1999 pushed hegemonism to a new level that is even more dangerous , threatening , and hypocritical .  That is , a new stage in which , in the name of preventing a humanitarian disaster , they have tied human rights diplomacy and military aggression even more tightly together , and a new stage in which hypocrisy and brutality are combined even more shamelessly .

They do not have a comprehensive and scientific understanding about the relationship between economic construction and ideological and political works and do not have sufficient understanding about the importance , urgency , and protracted nature of the ideological and political work .  If this state of affairs is allowed to go on , the guiding position of Marxism will be shaken and the people will lose the correct ideological foundation for jointly forging ahead , ending with ideological confusion .  This is very dangerous .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella .

If they carry on a reconnaissance mission near China , they are most likely to be viewed as invading the Chinese communists ' territorial air space , the direct result of which will be the United States and China resuming a dangerous game they had played in the Cold War era with the US military aircraft going on reconnaissance missions .  If so , the US forces are likely to face higher risks .  Moreover , if a similar unfortunate incident occurs in future , no one can guarantee that the US forces will suffer no casualties .

In its editorial entitled " Serious Consequences of US Arms Sales to Taiwan , " Wen Wei Po pointed out that it is both wrong and dangerous for the United States to be continuously selling arms and equipment to Taiwan , especially when the weapons sold are more and more sophisticated and the sums involved are larger and larger .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
In recent years , a submarine chaser group of the East Sea Fleet has successfully accomplished dozens of urgent , difficult , dangerous , and arduous tasks , such as emergency and disaster rescue , locating shipwrecks , and going on patrol at sea .  It has won the title of advanced unit in military training from the higher authorities for many years in a row and is known as " hunters " of the East China Sea .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
This requires that this party be composed of advanced people who have a common ideal , strict discipline and close relations with the people and the masses and that this party be able to struggle in an unswerving manner despite the extremely difficult and dangerous environment .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
However , such suppression has also increased the national sentiment on the mainland , thus preventing its internal moderate forces from gaining ground , and isolation may even lead to dangerous rash actions .  Taiwan may become the victim of the international power struggle .  This is the most pressing crisis to Taiwan at present .

For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .  Therefore , it was not included among the items to be converted to actual use .  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .

3 .  Railway , civil aviation , and transportation departments and enterprises should take resolute steps to stop the operation of any transportation vehicles that have mechanical problems .  In addition , the phenomena of violating safety regulations , such as over-loading , over-speeding , and violation of traffic regulations , should be resolutely stopped .  Passengers who carry with them flammable , explosive , poisonous , and dangerous articles should be strictly inspected .  They should be prohibited from taking transportation vehicles so as to ensure transportation safety .

The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .

In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Now Taiwan is in a period of intense change ; the economy is thriving and " political fever " is common . Each is centered on its own development . Each has its heroes . In a modern society where we are particular about equal development , this is something rather dangerous .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
And the growing process is far more dangerous and challenging than for a human , between shortages of food , intense competition , learning to fly and hunt , and having to find a nesting place ( so as not to overlap with one 's own parents ) . And nature is unforgiving . Though adults may exhaust themselves trying to feed the chicks , it often happens that not one is alive by the time it comes to leaving the nest .  
Asia is their homeAs an object of research , the tawny fish owl is less dangerous than the Formosan black bear , and not as rare as the now extinct clouded leopard . The tawny fish owl is found in India , mainland China and Taiwan , but in the almost 20 years that birdwatching has been popular in Taiwan , this owl has been sighted very few times , and has always been regarded as rare .  
From October to April , during the season of northeast rains , on the east and north coasts of Green Island the typical scene is of stormy seas , dark reefs and waves chipping away at the cliff walls . At this time the soft coral dwindles and large fish that move in giant schools grow in number . On the slopes of the reef , you can see fierce jackfish and sharks that grow nearly a meter long cruising about slowly . It 's dangerous and exciting .  
Naturally he does not exclude the possibility that some of these ships were brought to grief by Penghu 's strong winds and treacherous waters . For example , when exploring the tiny 1,000-meter-square island of Hsienchiao ( which means " dangerous coral reef " ) , he found an astounding amount of Yuan and Ming period potsherds .

Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams .

During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year .

My point is that the word " modern " is used in opposition to the classical period in the West . It has arisen as a natural continuation of the trajectory of Western culture . Because Western cultured is the world 's dominant culture , many non-Western cultures have adopted Western concepts regarding modernity while forgetting that our own cultural milieus are not completely the same as that of the West . Modern artists often treat Western ideas as if they were universal in their application , which is very dangerous .  
Kray Kee is a small settlement of the Karen minority , located in the northwestern Thai county of Tha Song Yang , nine kilometers from the nearest main road . It used to take three hours to reach on foot , until only a year ago villagers working together finally built a simple road through the mountains , allowing access to four-wheel-drive vehicles . However , during the monsoon season , this unstable mud road becomes much more dangerous to travel along and the only reliable way to reach the village is on foot .

The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
The dangerous stability of mutual assured destruction has been replaced by a less fearsome , but more uncertain and unstable , multipolar world , a world in rapid transition to an unknown destination .  
It is a fact that we have made a rather substantial advance in our thinking on specific disarmament issues and that we have moved across the dangerous line of confrontation towards a more complex labyrinth in which the options for greater progress are broad and open .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
The continuing political impasse in the Liberian peace process is a sign of a dangerous trend , also manifested in the Liberian parties ' disregard of the numerous appeals issued by the international community and by African regional organizations , in particular the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , and of the vigorous efforts aimed at the speedy achievement of a political settlement in that country .

are both in blatant violation of universally accepted norms and principles governing relations among nations and create dangerous precedents with unpredictable yet grave consequences detrimental to the cause of the rule of law and international peace and security .  
we have indicated in the past , we consider the insistence of American officials on repeating unsubstantiated and undocumented allegations that have already been proven fictitious as a matter of utmost irresponsibility and a serious and dangerous mistake , the continuation of which will have destructive repercussions for international relations and will create a climate of suspicion and distrust .

Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
Further evidence of this is the dangerous , irresponsible , uncontrolled and unregulated intrusion of this organization 's aircraft , for purposes other than providing air service , into a zone of significant international civil aviation activity and one of the most active international air corridors of the western hemisphere .  
But if this argument is not considered sufficient to prove that the world remains as unjust , unequal and dangerous as it was some years ago , it suffices to look at the conflicts which , with their profound causes that no one can resolve and their tragic consequences that can not be prevented or avoided , fill the newspapers every day .  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .

In considering the architecture for United Nations renewal , we should shape an Organization better prepared to respond to the following four priority needs : first , restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructive weaponry ; secondly , bolstering United Nations capabilities for effective peacekeeping and peace-building ; thirdly , assisting economic and social development while enhancing protection of the environment ; and fourthly , improving mechanisms for ensuring respect for international law and human rights .  
We also support the decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorism and punishing its perpetrators , as terrorism has become a dangerous international phenomenon that has taken the lives of many innocent people , destroyed the infrastructure of many countries , disrupted tourism and the free movement of innocent people and defamed national liberation and independence movements .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
Recent unilateral sanctions enacted by the United States against the trading partners of a number of countries not only constitute a grave breach of various norms and principles of international law and many resolutions of this Assembly and other international forums as well as blatant interference in the internal and external affairs of other States , but , indeed , point to a very dangerous trend , which undermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations .  
This is because their genuine efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region have in recent months met with grave and hostile incidents provoked by the occupying Power with an aggressive and dangerous policy that threatens the course of the peace process in the region .  It is common knowledge that all of this is possible thanks to the support Israel continues to receive from the United States , which has never concealed its determination to veto in the Security Council any resolution that contains firm statements against Israel 's conduct in the Middle East .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .

The Moroccan delegation 's initiative sought to impose a singular , selective , partisan and tendentious interpretation of the reports of the Secretary-General and to accept it would have set an unfortunate and dangerous precedent .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
A call for harmonization and uniformity was first expressed in Council resolution 1743 ( LIV ) of 4 May 1973 , in which the Council , mindful of the increase of unitization and containerization of cargoes as part of total world transportation , invited " international organizations concerned to foster the adoption of a single system of identification , classification and labelling of dangerous goods " and requested the Committee to continue to investigate divergencies currently existing in the modal practices in that respect .  
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
However , under Rule 644 ( i ) , " No convicted prisoner inside the prison other than a camp or temporary prison shall be fettered except on the ground that he is violent , dangerous or had escaped or attempted to escape " .  
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Rabbi Cooper also stated that materials that were illegal in most other democratic countries , including those deemed dangerous , racist or defamatory under the laws of those countries , could be posted on the Internet in the United States , thereby becoming accessible to virtually everyone around the globe , regardless of national legislation .  
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
The political exploitation of this international problem , through hurling unfounded allegations in order to advance certain ulterior motives or cover up deficiencies in domestic or external policy , is no less dangerous than terrorism itself .  
In themselves such weapons threaten an imbalance in nature , and many of the biological agents that can be used as weapons are capable of frustrating all the efforts made in previous decades to eradicate diseases that are highly contagious and extremely dangerous to human health worldwide .  
The illicit traffic in toxic and dangerous products and wastes can assume various forms , the principal characteristic being the ability of the persons engaged therein to adapt to the changing international situation .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Aggravated rape is rape accompanied by threat of murder or by serious injury or committed by a person with a record of previous rape conviction and especially aggravated rape is rape accomplished by a group of persons or by an especially dangerous recidivist or entailing especially grave consequences and also rape of a minor ;  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
In its general debate , the Committee had further included a reference to all those activities that were dangerous or harmful to the child 's physical , mental and spiritual development or were liable to jeopardize the future education and training of the child .  
A complete revised set of recommended provisions concerning the design , construction , inspection , testing and approval of portable tanks ( tank-containers ) intended for the transport of liquid and solid dangerous substances , non-refrigerated liquefied gases , and refrigerated liquefied gases was elaborated .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The most dangerous agricultural pest , the pink mealy bug , is being controlled by bio-control agents a hybrid beetle and a parasitic wasp .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
This initiative is designed to deal with the various facets of the grave phenomenon of arms proliferation , which besides draining vast resources that could be devoted to the social and economic development of our peoples constitutes the most dangerous threat to the peace and security of the world .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
In this connection , I am pleased to inform the Assembly that in October 1996 my country 's Parliament , at the initiative of the Executive , adopted a law that establishes norms and punishments for the crime of laundering money or goods derived from illicit traffic in narcotics , psychotropic substances or dangerous drugs , thereby significantly improving the legal framework for combating such crimes head on .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
He is referring to the interrelationship between three problems : growing unemployment , which affects the poorest sectors and might lead to dangerous marginalization ; urban crime , which has very high rates and is prejudicial to substantive human rights such as the right to life and the right to physical integrity ; and security , which involves serious defects and alarming contrasts .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
The two major crises that broke out in Bulgaria and Albania in 1996 - and which are still unresolved , although progress has been made in Bulgaria - underlined in a dramatic fashion the fragility of the transition process in some countries and demonstrated how misleading and dangerous it can be to focus on changes in a few macroeconomic variables such as indicators of progress and success .  
It had made it clear , moreover , that the timetables laid down in those Agreements would not be respected and had continued with other dangerous violations of the Agreements , including the seizure of Palestinian territory , the intentional delay in its redeployment from Hebron , its continuous attempts to create new facts on the ground in occupied East Jerusalem , and the resumption of colonial settlement activities in the occupied territories , in contravention of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .  
The Front ( UINFSA ) calls upon the Taliban to take into serious account the sufferings and miseries of the innocent civilian population in Afghanistan resulting from the protracted imposed war and to declare their readiness through joining a genuine intra-Afghan dialogue aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement , rather than pursuing the dangerous option of continuing war in Afghanistan .  
The Metro Manila city and town mayors have agreed to pursue a common resettlement site for their respective urban poor constituents who need to be relocated because they are occupying dangerous zones and critical areas for government infrastructure projects .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
It was even more dangerous when information imbalances were accompanied by aggressive policies which violated independence and national sovereignty ; Cuba continued to be the target of radio and television attacks by the Government of the United States of America in open defiance of the elementary norms of coexistence among States and the principles of international law , and despite repeated condemnation by specialized bodies and forums .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
But what makes the terrorism rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous is that the terrorists invoke a distorted , twisted and fanatic interpretation of Islam , which is very distant from enlightened Islam . We have no quarrel with Islam . 
We , the representatives of the international community , can not , at this historical juncture , ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theory that runs counter to the common work and collective obligations we agreed upon for international life .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Other examples included an ad hoc tribunal to investigate allegations of improper supply or prescription of dangerous drugs and a national reference laboratory to undertake research on controlled substances and the applicable international controls .  
. . .  This destructive process has been hastened by the close links that have been established among the armed groups , the armies of losers , which proliferate throughout central Africa , and of which the former Rwandan government forces are the most violent , well armed , well organized and dangerous ( para .  91 ) .  
The law provided a framework for improving their status , but it was unevenly implemented because of ingrained cultural attitudes ; large segments of rural and urban society still resorted to customary laws in regard to marriage and divorce and dangerous traditional practices , such as circumcision , continued to prevail in many areas .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
A dangerous precedent has been set for the revival of the policy of imposing ones will by force , and the entire modern international legal order has been jeopardized .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
At its special session , the General Assembly recognized that the problem of climate change is one of the biggest challenges that will face the world in the twenty-first century , and stated that the ultimate goal , shared by all countries , was to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
No firm decision as regards a possible future four-year periodicity of amendments should be taken during the period of alignment of the format of the various legal instruments concerning modal aspects of the transport of dangerous goods on that of the model regulations , and pending decisions regarding the implementation of the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals in accordance with Agenda 21 objectives ;  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
When it is required to ensure liquid dangerous goods remain in their intended orientation , package orientation labels meeting the specifications of ISO 780:1985 shall be affixed on at least two opposite vertical sides with the arrows pointing in the correct direction .  
The Recommendation enumerates the factors to be taken into account in determining the types of hazardous work , for example , work which exposes children to physical , psychological or sexual abuse ; work underground , or at dangerous heights ; work with dangerous machinery ; and work in an unhealthy environment .  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
It would be particularly dangerous , under the pretext of exorcising painful emotions or absolving the international community of its past inaction or its inability now and in the future to prevent or settle crises , to risk acting without the consent of a State , or even against its desire , with excesses as serious as regrettable endangering the collective security system so painstakingly built around the Security Council .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
It should be remembered that the national legislation of most countries established regimes of absolute liability for the cases covered by the draft articles , in other words for acts which were lawful but dangerous , which were tolerated because they had beneficial effects for society as a whole , even if they could in fact cause damage to private persons .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
Having recognized the value of open economies , we should , however , be ready to address emerging population problems such as increasing migration including transit migration , outflow of the most productive young strata of society from the less developed economies to the more prosperous ones , drug trafficking and the spread of AIDS and other dangerous diseases , to name but a few .  
Unfortunately , we all know that the commitments undertaken in the Convention were not sufficient to meet its ultimate objective , which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system .  
The Committee calls on the Government to cease and prevent , in law and in practice , all forms of social , economic and physical violence and discrimination against women and children , especially the continuous , degrading and dangerous practice of female genital mutilation .  
Peacekeeping operations had originally been intended as a means of controlling dangerous regional conflicts and had involved such tasks as monitoring ceasefires , separating hostile parties and maintaining buffer zones , whereas today the proliferation of conflicts stemming from various factors had resulted in more complex missions , involving political , military and humanitarian activities simultaneously . 
An ecological branch of the police force was established in 1994 to curb ecological crime , carry out investigations at the request of the public prosecutor , enforce respect of protected areas and prevent the illicit dumping of dangerous and toxic substances which are injurious to the environment and human life and health .  
In the press release she published herself on 19 June , at the end of her visit , the Special Rapporteur endorsed this appeal and emphasized the vital nature of preventive action at national , regional and international level to halt the illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which seriously threatened the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
Article 56 of the law states that " To produce , process , package , import , export , trade , supply , transport , store , keep , have in warehouse or use products or substances that are toxic , dangerous or noxious to human health or to the environment , contrary to the requirements established in laws or regulations " entails a prison sentence ranging from one to four years and a fine .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
With reference to Paraguay , the Special Rapporteur points out that at the end of her visit to the country , she issued an appeal in which she stressed the importance of preventive measures at national , regional and international level in order to halt the illegal dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which is a serious threat to the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
The Kuwaiti Government ' s policy to weaken Iraq , which is faced with a virulent American-Zionist campaign owing to its nationalist positions in defence of Arab rights , is motivated by selfish considerations , a narrow vision and goals about which the least one can say is that they are suspect and dangerous . "  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
Likewise , new safety and environmental standards impose on building owners major obligations to retrofit existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , handicap access , interior air quality , asbestos abatement , shielding of electromagnetic fields , elimination of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) compounds , and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
In this era , when there are no natural enemies , and thus no natural allies , some seek to advance their political and military ambitions by playing on racial and religious fears to give life to the dangerous doctrine of an impending clash of civilizations .  
The short term is the timehorizon of markets and market economies , focused as they are on financial markets , quick profits and ways of surviving and expanding in an environment perceived as precarious and dangerous .  
As we look ahead , we can see real risks that resource depletion , especially freshwater scarcities , as well as severe forms of environmental degradation , may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
The existing system , which relies on unpredictable and piecemeal funding and outdated , cumbersome and complex procedures is simply not suited for the difficult and dangerous situations in which United Nations personnel are obliged to work .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
We are convinced that the absence of such dialogue , against the backdrop of social tension and a very difficult economic situation , could have the most dangerous consequences for the future of post-conflict recovery in the Central African Republic , and could lead to a situation in which the results of the international communitys efforts over the past few years would be lost and reduced to naught .  
Despite Afghanistans slide into chaos in recent years , and the dangerous and destabilizing implications that that has had for the subregion and elsewhere , the international community still has an essential moral duty not to condemn the entire Afghan people for the mistakes of an authority that has been isolated within the country and has made enemies of much of the rest of the world by turning that country into a base camp for an international terrorist network .  
The climate of tension resulting from dangerous Israeli actions , including killing of defenceless children , had impaired development activities and threatened the human resource base of present and future Palestinian generations .  
Note with grave concern the negative effects on health and the environment of environmental racism suffered , in particular , by countries in Africa , including the illicit dumping of toxic wastes and substances , hazardous working and living conditions and dangerous methods of extracting natural resources .  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Urge States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Urges States to give special attention , when promoting and implementing legislative and judicial policies designed to give workers adequate protection , to the serious situation of lack of protection and , in some cases , the exploitation or trafficking of victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , a situation that allows or facilitates confinement , as in the case of domestic workers and dangerous and badly paid jobs ;  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
This resolution , however , representing as it does a dangerous precedent in which the Security Council gives unlimited authorization to States cooperating with the Government of Kuwait to interfere with civilian trade , is not based on Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and does not therefore make it permissible to use coercive military measures for its enforcement .  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
This campaign , which is being conducted in grave and flagrant violation of signed commitments reached between Israel and the Palestinian leadership , and which represents a dangerous departure from the spirit and the letter of the Middle East peace process , is the direct result of the relentless incitement in the official Palestinian media , the collusion between the Palestinian leadership and recognized terrorist groups , and the release of scores of terrorists from Palestinian prisons . 
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours .
