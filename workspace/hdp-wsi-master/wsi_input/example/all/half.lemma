Art as Life : As dusk came over , sacred Tawu Mountain gradually was shrouded and disappeared . In a flash , Sakuliu had manufactured a durable firewall out of flagstones in the front room , and lit an enormous piece of wood using only half a sheet of newspaper , and then in one graceful gesture moved the now-cooled pot of water next to the fire to warm up .  
Even more tragic is that over the past two year , with a strategy of doing low-cost contracting , Sampo has attained substantial sales for air conditioners there . Unfortunately , in so doing it evoked the envy of the Japanese industry . Matsushita and Mitsubishi , major manufacturers of the compressor , an essential part , cut the supply in half . " We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
The ordinary teachers are also rigorously tested , attend lessons and write theses . Publishing articles in academic journals is compulsory work and under-taking research occupies at least half the workload . The topics of research are decided from above and there is no autonomy here . " Researchers in national defense have all been through a strict process of selection , " says V . Prudnikov .  
More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout . Besides featuring new academic concepts , the research center combines the latest art and technology in its architecture - - spacious , attractive buildings nestled in the hills . The big lecture halls , which can seat hundreds , are equipped with five or six television screens hooked up to the podium .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
The resistance to illness among children with Down 's is poor , and they easily catch infections . Add to this that many of those with Down 's suffer compound illnesses , with half having congenital heart problems , with others possibly having irregularly shaped intestines , leukemia , abnormal functioning of the thyroid , and other conditions , which can easily be fatal .  
Unfortunately , " R &amp; D is the easy part , sharing is hard . " The notebook computer alliance , organized by 46 firms , produced alliance product types in the brief space of half a year , and won considerable attention at international exhibitions . But after the technology was transferred , the manufacturers who took it over began a flurry of little maneuvers , and the price-cutting situation was " ruthless . "  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
Such is the case with the banyan , the timber of which is easily distorted ; the Formosan sweet gum , which people do not like to cut because it bleeds red sap ; and the autumn maple tree with its knotty trunk . Together , these make up more than half the old trees presently listed by the D . A . F . Thanks to the temples many old trees are left standing .  
Plants are 90 percent water , and a thriving 100-year-old tree needs to replace close to half a metric ton of water lost to evaporation every day . Without an unending supply of water , a tree will be hard pressed to grow big .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
TSC imported a complete hothouse facility from the Netherlands , but within half a year an intense electrical storm had knocked out the computer that controlled the temperature . They sought help from Holland , but were shocked when their counterpart asked for NT $ 500,000 . This fortified their determination to " develop a greenhouse suited to Taiwan , " states Center director Hu Chun-kwang .  
He believes that one of the main reasons why Taiwan fell into the hands of foreign rulers for half a century of its modern history was that the island 's rich mineral deposits had aroused the greed of other nations .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
Of the three concerts in the event , two were completely sold out , and not even the extra standing tickets were enough to meet the demand . And with the New York audiences ' rapturous applause , the concerts lasted two and a half hours instead of two as originally planned , breaking with the stereotype that modern music is a curse at the box office .  
With their characteristic outline gone and their bodies covered by a tarpaulin which leaves only half their heads exposed , although the sharks ' teeth are still sharp , their eyes are sunken and they are no longer frightening . There they will wait until night , when lorries arrive to take them for auction at Taipei 's central market , ending their landward journey .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
On the side of a giant coral formation that is 100 or even 1000-plus years old , grow water lilies , which are a kind of echinoderm that looks like a flower blooming in the sea . With backs striped yellow and blue , a school of fusilierfish swim by . A clownfish , a strange being that lives on sea anemones , is busy delving into everything . Colorful butterflyfish and damselfish hiding in the web of coral reveal half their heads .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
For example , the monthly base fee for a mobile phone has gone from NT $ 1800 , before market liberalization was announced , to the current NT $ 600 . Use charges have fallen from NT $ 12 per minute to less than half that .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Of course , during the half century of life spent here , in which he married , raised children , and had a successful career , people from Shandong looked after each other , but the genuine selflessness of the people in Taiwan was like a loving mother consoling the hearts of these exiled sons . Pa 's feelings about Taiwan are without a shred of pretense .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
Unlike Taiwan 's many man-made lakes and ponds , which are often planted with water lily and lotus , this pond is home to the little-known Taiwan brandy bottle , a species endemic to Taiwan . Over half the surface of the water is covered with this beautiful plant 's oval leaves and yellow blossoms .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
The whole trip takes about half the day . She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT-Mart 's deli department . She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure . She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang-tzu . As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .  
These days the mainland always is looking to " jump straight to the head of the queue . " For example , the US telephone giant AT &amp; T , starting from copper wires , dominated its market for half a century . But the mainland has skipped right over this stage . In Shanghai , most houses are directly linked to the fiber-optic network , while mobile phones are omnipresent in the city .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
We wend our way first through the heavily populated and prosperous Xiamen City and zip along a straight , smooth expressway toward Tongan County , better than 50 kilometers distant . Soon , however , we get off the modern highway and onto bumpy gravel and mud . After an hour and a half we arrive at Lutang Village .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
Only 11 and a half years old at the time , Yu-ju had a unique experience one twilight evening while participating in a white-robe meditation session . With everyone swaying to the rhythm of religious music , she saw many points of silver light hovering in the air above the seat where Osho 's founder used to sit when he was alive .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
In the half year that he worked on the project , he raised rabbits and rats in his workshop , would go to the Niuhsu area of Beikang in order to shoot pictures of water buffalo , visited the zoo to gaze at monkeys , perused encyclopedias to gain a better understanding of animal behavior , and then labored on the cut tin pieces on his work table , which were hammered into shape , inlaid with ornamentation and welded without casting .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work .

In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response .

Hsu Kuo-chiang left his Szechuan home at thirteen , and spent half a century serving at the level of a common soldier . Five years ago he entered a veterans ' home , accustomed to life alone .  
One of the real contributions of this congress was to establish a process for the input of public opinion through the nominating system for the Central Committee , for which half the nominees were selected by the chairman and half by petition among the delegates . The vote was by secret ballot of all the delegates , increasing the supervisory role of the base level vis-a-vis the center while making the latter more sensitive to the former .

Since Dr . Joseph Needham decided in 1938 to write a systematic . objective and authoritative history of science in China , the Cambridge University Press has published no less than seven large volumes of his Science and Civilisation in China comprising within them some fifteen books . Having devoted his life to cultivating this project over more than half a century , Needham is still applying his astonishing perseverance to the process of writing his long-awaited conclusion .  
Why is there no science in Chinese culture ? " - - this kind of question seems unavoidably anachronistic today , largely thanks to Joseph Needham and his collaborators who have spent more than half a century looking at all the evidence concerned . Now , no matter whether in East or West , most people can understand the scientific achievements of ancient and medieval China and how far China was ahead of the West .  
Most downstream pollution comes from industrial and residential sources , but in sparsely populated upstream regions , not only have the water and soil been damaged by tea plantations , fruit orchards and vegetable farms , but excessive use of fertilizers has led to half of the reservoirs becoming infested with algae .

Hung Chia-li , a matchmaker at the I Hsuan Agency , says that some women deliberately " downgrade " themselves on their personal information cards , changing a master 's degree to a bachelor 's degree or a bureau chief position to a section head , because they 're afraid of scaring men off . Statistics show that more than half of all women with a college education or higher have married husbands less well educated than they are .

Even more tragic is that over the past two year , with a strategy of doing low-cost contracting , Sampo has attained substantial sales for air conditioners there . Unfortunately , in so doing it evoked the envy of the Japanese industry . Matsushita and Mitsubishi , major manufacturers of the compressor , an essential part , cut the supply in half . " We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
The ordinary teachers are also rigorously tested , attend lessons and write theses . Publishing articles in academic journals is compulsory work and under-taking research occupies at least half the workload .

More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout . Besides featuring new academic concepts , the research center combines the latest art and technology in its architecture - - spacious , attractive buildings nestled in the hills . The big lecture halls , which can seat hundreds , are equipped with five or six television screens hooked up to the podium .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds .

Unfortunately , " R &amp; D is the easy part , sharing is hard . " The notebook computer alliance , organized by 46 firms , produced alliance product types in the brief space of half a year , and won considerable attention at international exhibitions . But after the technology was transferred , the manufacturers who took it over began a flurry of little maneuvers , and the price-cutting situation was " ruthless . "  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
Such is the case with the banyan , the timber of which is easily distorted ; the Formosan sweet gum , which people do not like to cut because it bleeds red sap ; and the autumn maple tree with its knotty trunk . Together , these make up more than half the old trees presently listed by the D . A . F . Thanks to the temples many old trees are left standing .  
Plants are 90 percent water , and a thriving 100-year-old tree needs to replace close to half a metric ton of water lost to evaporation every day . Without an unending supply of water , a tree will be hard pressed to grow big .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
TSC imported a complete hothouse facility from the Netherlands , but within half a year an intense electrical storm had knocked out the computer that controlled the temperature . They sought help from Holland , but were shocked when their counterpart asked for NT $ 500,000 . This fortified their determination to " develop a greenhouse suited to Taiwan , " states Center director Hu Chun-kwang .  
He believes that one of the main reasons why Taiwan fell into the hands of foreign rulers for half a century of its modern history was that the island 's rich mineral deposits had aroused the greed of other nations .  
Over thirty years , I wrote five books in Chinese . Since becoming ill , in less than half a year I have written two . I have discovered that my potential can be devoted to writing . This confidence is also something that readers have built up for me .  
And very recently , with the arrival of spring , climatic conditions are highly unstable , so it is very difficult to ascertain whether it will rain or not . After his weather forecasts have turned out to be totally incorrect , a patient afflicted with bronchitis could not resist calling up TTV in order to complain . " Jen Li-yu 's ability to forecast the weather is not half as accurate as my own bronchial tubes . "  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
Of the three concerts in the event , two were completely sold out , and not even the extra standing tickets were enough to meet the demand . And with the New York audiences ' rapturous applause , the concerts lasted two and a half hours instead of two as originally planned , breaking with the stereotype that modern music is a curse at the box office .  
With their characteristic outline gone and their bodies covered by a tarpaulin which leaves only half their heads exposed , although the sharks ' teeth are still sharp , their eyes are sunken and they are no longer frightening . There they will wait until night , when lorries arrive to take them for auction at Taipei 's central market , ending their landward journey .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
The DOH did not begin to encourage the private sector to establish hospitals for chronic illnesses until 1991 . Up to the end of 1993 , there were only 20,000 beds reserved for chronic disease patients nationwide , half of which were for psychiatric patients . Only 4,450 hospital beds are set aside for the more than 60 kinds of ordinary chronic illnesses . Moreover , most of those beds belong to the veterans ' hospitals , to which the general public has no access . "  
On the side of a giant coral formation that is 100 or even 1000-plus years old , grow water lilies , which are a kind of echinoderm that looks like a flower blooming in the sea . With backs striped yellow and blue , a school of fusilierfish swim by . A clownfish , a strange being that lives on sea anemones , is busy delving into everything . Colorful butterflyfish and damselfish hiding in the web of coral reveal half their heads .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
At 5:55 am , five minutes before the race begins , a white Honda Civic pulls up in front of the front gate . A group of people swiftly get out and rush toward the starting line . Right then , from either side , the pack of teenage girls that have already been waiting for a long time impulsively rushes forward , but half way there , workers shout at them , " Back up , back up ! They 're about to start running , you 'll be knocked over . "  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
Now close your eyes and imagine yourself looking out over the foggy ocean . In less than three years , that stretch of land now occupied by dismal-looking aquaculture ponds will be transformed into Mailiao International Port . This will be the first-ever port in Taiwan built with private funding , as well as Taiwan 's deepest harbor . The handling capacity after only the first phase of construction will be a full half of today 's giant Kaohsiung Harbor ( one of the busiest in the world ) .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
On the maritime extreme of Europe , England had always been saturated by the arts of Italy and France . It was not easy to work out how to create a " natural garden " and it was hardly desirable to give half the credit to the far-away Chinese .  
For example , the monthly base fee for a mobile phone has gone from NT $ 1800 , before market liberalization was announced , to the current NT $ 600 . Use charges have fallen from NT $ 12 per minute to less than half that .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
He detested civil war , but led troops fighting in civil wars for over a decade ; he was eager to fight the Japanese , but failed when he did so ; he opposed communism half his life , but at the crucial juncture saved the communist party ; he was faithful to Chiang Kai-shek for years , yet while in the field rebelled and kidnapped Chiang , and in the end was kept locked up by Chiang for decades .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Spending over 3000 hours with the caltrop birds over four and a half years , I have grown with them and seen them go from being ordinary birds to being noticed by conservationists and gradually becoming celebrities . But with the headlong rush to development and a complete lack of any effective plan for preserving their habitat , I am afraid that in the end they will once again be ignored .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
My legs would get weak . I could n't keep stable , and I could n't keep my head up when I went into a low stance . After about a half year of training , though , I did n't have that problem any more . " As his training progressed , he developed a feel for what the classics mean when they talk about remaining " loose and unperturbed . "  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Of course , during the half century of life spent here , in which he married , raised children , and had a successful career , people from Shandong looked after each other , but the genuine selflessness of the people in Taiwan was like a loving mother consoling the hearts of these exiled sons . Pa 's feelings about Taiwan are without a shred of pretense .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
The ruling party itself adopted her causes-democracy , freedom , and the ROC 's return to the United Nations-as its own . She found herself in the mainstream , and became one of the most influential members of the opposition party . She served in the national legislature , was invited to serve as a national policy advisor to the president , and was elected to two consecutive terms as county commissioner in Taoyuan . Before her second term was half finished , Chen Shui-bian selected her as his vice-presidential running mate .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
Unlike Taiwan 's many man-made lakes and ponds , which are often planted with water lily and lotus , this pond is home to the little-known Taiwan brandy bottle , a species endemic to Taiwan . Over half the surface of the water is covered with this beautiful plant 's oval leaves and yellow blossoms .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
The situation is somewhat different in Japan , a close neighbor of Taiwan and its former colonial master for half a century , which has a more complex emotional relationship with the island . The Japanese academic community has long paid close attention to non-literary aspects of the Taiwan experience , and it is against this background that Taiwan literature is now getting more attention .  
Another writer whose works have won a warm reception in translation is Cheng Ching-wen . According to David Der-wei Wang , chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University , over the past half century Cheng has recorded and carried on the spirit of humanism in Taiwan ; his work is measured and sophisticated , totally different from the unsettled state of modern society . Last year , Cheng won the 1999 Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize for the English translation of his collection of short stories entitled Three-Legged Horse .  
On November 20 , the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) marked its sixth month as the ruling party , but because of a long series of political disturbances during the last half year , the Chen administration 's attempt to run a " government of the whole people " crumbled , and instead it formed a minority government . Thus , the cabinet has consistently found itself a " new hand behind the wheel . " Major policies naturally have not been fully implemented , engendering an aura of dejection , and dour expectations for the economy .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
The whole trip takes about half the day . She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT-Mart 's deli department . She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure . She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .  
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music . His major opera on Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) debuted just last year . The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many .  
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang-tzu . As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .  
These days the mainland always is looking to " jump straight to the head of the queue . " For example , the US telephone giant AT &amp; T , starting from copper wires , dominated its market for half a century . But the mainland has skipped right over this stage . In Shanghai , most houses are directly linked to the fiber-optic network , while mobile phones are omnipresent in the city .  
The patient at the center of the story , Chou Chin-yao , eventually published an account of the incident entitled A Skin Graft with Love ( 1984 ) . " Each time I recall the extraordinary grace that Dr . and Mrs . Landsborough bestowed on one so sick , it brings me to tears , even though half a century has passed since then . Words can not describe the intensity of my gratitude .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
We wend our way first through the heavily populated and prosperous Xiamen City and zip along a straight , smooth expressway toward Tongan County , better than 50 kilometers distant . Soon , however , we get off the modern highway and onto bumpy gravel and mud . After an hour and a half we arrive at Lutang Village .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
Only 11 and a half years old at the time , Yu-ju had a unique experience one twilight evening while participating in a white-robe meditation session . With everyone swaying to the rhythm of religious music , she saw many points of silver light hovering in the air above the seat where Osho 's founder used to sit when he was alive .  
The little rural township of Luku , located in Nantou County , has a population of only 20,000 or so . Fifty-nine percent of the people are tea farmers . It is estimated that Nantou County accounts for one-third of the 18,000 hectares of land in Taiwan devoted to tea plantations , with Luku accounting for one half of Nantou 's total . Whether measured by cultivated area or production volume , Luku is the largest single tea-producing township in Taiwan .  
Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management . " Although this is difficult to implement-even more challenging , in fact , given the need to maintain competitiveness amidst a global downturn-it is essential .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
In Lukang , the clans Hsu , Huang , and Shih controlled half the town / In the Qianlong reign , the city prospered , and the sails of boats were as numerous as flying fish / In Lukang , spring and autumn dreams , it rose and fell in a single 60-year cycle / Clouds from the west , currents from the east , tourists bring change without knowing what they do .  
And so he often placed his classmates against barren backgrounds for photographs . He sometimes painted half of a model 's face white or had him lie on a rock with a plastic bag over his head and a black cape over his shoulders . Chang tried to make his subjects look alienated and isolated , as if life had given up on them .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
In the half year that he worked on the project , he raised rabbits and rats in his workshop , would go to the Niuhsu area of Beikang in order to shoot pictures of water buffalo , visited the zoo to gaze at monkeys , perused encyclopedias to gain a better understanding of animal behavior , and then labored on the cut tin pieces on his work table , which were hammered into shape , inlaid with ornamentation and welded without casting .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
He gives half the income from the restaurant to charity , and once a month he hosts a free dinner for a guest list that includes volunteer teachers and lonely elderly people with no families . He also works to promote environmental , conservation , and animal-rights values in the PRC , so that the vegetarian outlook on life can set down deeper roots , and not just be limited to eating habits or health .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
In a survey of the dreams of youth taken by Sinorama in December among 19 to 30-year-olds , nearly half ( 46.7% ) included " live as I please , free and unrestrained " as one of their life dreams , far beyond the second most popular choice of " a happy family life " ( 29.8% ) and the third of " a stable job " ( 26.6% ) .  
According to the organizers , the number of people sleeping rough in Taipei City alone is increasing by some 200 every year . The charities currently serve over 2000 homeless people in the city , of whom 90% are male and more than half are aged between 40 and 60 . The majority of them could not face their families after losing their jobs , and finally ended up on the street , as " economic " homeless .  
Unexpected was the fact that children very much hoped to live with their elderly parents and conform to the traditional model of filial piety in this regard , while the image they had for themselves in old age was rather untraditional . Future plans for almost half of them tended toward living with their spouses only or living alone ( 43.9% ) , and they also stressed economic independence ( 44.4% ) .  
If that is not effective , the sufferer should take another puff in half an hour , and if that does not work they should immediately be rushed to an emergency ward . If the respiratory tract has contracted to the point where the bronchodilator can not get through , the patient will need an immediate injection before it is too late . Repeated use of a bronchodilator , however , can lead to cardiac arrhythmia .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
But in less than half an hour , the calm weather changed drastically . A violent wind blew in laden with snow . The Russian pilot , experienced in polar transportation and supply , decided to withdraw immediately . On hearing the shouts of the other crewmembers the groups that were dispersed around the pole taking photos raced toward the helicopter .  
In its Mental Health Index Survey , completed late last year , the Mental Health Foundation discovered that approximately one half of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted that a slight increase in stress causes them to blow up . Even more shocking is the fact that 19 participants gave themselves " zero " when asked to quantify their mental health . Clear warning signals are flashing for the mental health of Taiwanese .  
These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
The technician , responsible for recording the meteorological data , gets up at around 4:50 a.m . , and half an hour earlier in winter , because it is necessary to clean off the overnight rime that has coated the equipment , with hot water .  
Ho says that as soon as people with a foot disability try on their custom-made shoes , they can feel the difference . A man with one leg 12 centimeters shorter than the other had to wear a shoe with a built-up sole that weighed 1.5 kilos . The FRTRI used foam materials that reduced the weight of the shoe by half . The satisfied and grateful customer was delighted at how light and comfortable his new shoes were .  
Among the various folk art performance groups , " Household Generals " troupes , with their painted faces and awe-inspiring and beautiful movements , appear quite mysterious amid the smoke of exploding strings of firecrackers . Holding terrifying tools of torture , they strike fear deep into people 's hearts . And the performers in these troupes-seemingly half god and half man-send their audiences back and forth between realms celestial and earthly .  
Every nook and cranny of the cave is extraordinary , as if carved by spirits . We were surprised to learn that nature can create formations of such beauty underground . Most tourists only see the first half of the cave . We asked permission to go into the rear part , and to do so we had to crawl and clamber for more than an hour , sometimes moving sideways and sometimes lying on our backs .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
Diabetes was the fourth leading cause of death in Taiwan last year , and is a contributing cause of strokes ( the number-two killer ) , cardiovascular disease ( ranking third ) , and kidney dysfunction ( tenth ) . To be more exact , diabetes is directly or indirectly involved in more than half the fatalities due to the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan .

During the past half century the United Nations , as no other international organization , has acquired credibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace , as a mediator and active participant in the peaceful settlement of conflicts , and as a champion of human rights .  
While the first half of the twentieth century has left in the mind of mankind the haunting memories of two dreadful world wars , in the second half of this century , despite the fierce local wars that have taken place such as those in Indochina , Korea and Viet Nam nations have been spared the horrors of a global conflagration .  
Thus , for those who believe that the African is less than human or is incapable of governing himself , the existence for almost a century and a half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with strong economic potential is undesirable .  
Liberia , which was founded about half a century before the Berlin Congress of 1884 , which carved out Africa and institutionalized colonialism as an asylum for free people of colour fleeing the hot crucibles and bitter pangs of slavery , was threatened with partition and trusteeship by the League of Nations , predecessor to our beloved United Nations , half a century after that colonial Congress . Ironically , the charge was slave trading .  
This half century will also be remembered as a time of tremendous waste of human creativity and energy for purposes of destruction , a time of rising disparities between nations , of flagrant abuse of nature and its finite resources and , above all , of unprecedented loss of human lives and human deprivation despite the infinite possibilities opened up by revolutions in science and technology .  
El Salvador experienced one of the most severe , complex and difficult crises in Central America in the second half of this century in the 1980s , to be precise , when a military and political conflict began and went on for 12 years .  
As I have stated , not only is it not true that a majority of the people voted for continued or enhanced territorial status , not only did fewer than half of the eligible voters vote at all , but because of the low percentage , the referendum , on its own legal terms , was invalid .

We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
Women , who represent half of all adults newly infected with HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , have emphasized that social vulnerability and the unequal power relationships between women and men are obstacles to safe sex , in their efforts to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .  
NULLConstituting more than half of the population living in absolute poverty , women would thus represent the majority of the beneficiaries targeted by any properly designed micro-entrepreneur and SME development programmes - except where their participation in production and economic activity is constrained by social factors or by special limitations on their access to capital .  
Such emphasis on women is warranted since women , who compose more than half of the world 's poor , often face special legal and social obstructions in carrying out business and economic activities , despite their record of being responsible entrepreneurs and the principal contributors to the welfare of the family .  
During the last half of March 1995 , a high-level team of three experts , including specialists in architectural , construction management , project scheduling , human resource monitoring and time extension analysis , accompanied by a representative of senior management from Headquarters , travelled to Addis Ababa to review and evaluate the situation , and to establish a course of action to ensure the timely completion of the project .

Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .
