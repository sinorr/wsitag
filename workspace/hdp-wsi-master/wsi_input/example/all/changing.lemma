Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature .

One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
Drawing on the successful experiences of foreign countries , China has successively set up the four financial asset management companies of Xinda , Dongfang , Changcheng , and Huarong since last year .

Under the present circumstances wherein the contradiction between pastures and livestock has proved a predominant problem in a majority of pastoral areas in the region , we should no longer follow the old development road of a quantity expansion .  Instead , we must make up our mind to increase the intensity of changing the growth pattern of the economy ; and lay the stress of the region 's development of animal husbandry on improving breeds , upgrading pastures , enhancing quality , and boosting economic efficiency .  
The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .

In the new century , international competition will get more and more intense , the reform and construction tasks at home will also be heavy and arduous .

In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
But the more rapidly changing East has faced greater challenges . Problems and achievements , the sweet and the bitter , have been mixed together like the coffee , cream , and sugar in a cup of instant coffee , and the boiling water poured on top has produced a fragrant but scalding concoction . The Republic of China is one of the most rapidly developing countries in Asia .  
Two centuries of adaptation and hard work combined with changing political and economic factors have made " the smooth integration of the Chinese into the multicultural society of Hawaii one of the rare success stories in the history of world immigration , " as Professor Clarence E .

On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened .

On the tangible side , we must begin by changing modern domestic architecture . Builders should adopt the spirit of the traditional courtyard house and design residential developments that meet the needs of small families yet reflect the spirit of the extended family home .  
Hung Chia-li , a matchmaker at the I Hsuan Agency , says that some women deliberately " downgrade " themselves on their personal information cards , changing a master 's degree to a bachelor 's degree or a bureau chief position to a section head , because they 're afraid of scaring men off .

" But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
Doing away with stereotypes : As far as Chang Hsiao-hung is concerned , postmodern game stratagems , or as she terms it , " gender performance , " can lend feminism new vitality and allow it to adapt to complex , changing postmodern culture .

Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers .

For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs .

Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .

The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times .

Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color .

As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals .

" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract .

Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management .

With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home .

Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes .

Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas .

Lin .  
Li says that in Indonesia , where anti-Chinese sentiment is intense , the fact that Tzu Chi often lends a hand is gradually changing local attitudes toward Chinese .

For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet .

The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .

The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .

The Forum believed this statement sets out clear visionary but achievable goals , based on its members ' many shared interests and building on the Forum 's tradition of close regional consultation , which would significantly strengthen the region 's capacity to adapt to a rapidly changing international and regional environment .  
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
Among the economic and social factors influencing this process are population growth and voluntary and involuntary migration , real and perceived employment opportunities , cultural expectations , changing consumption and production patterns and serious imbalances and disparities among regions . 
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
A wide variety of approaches are currently being used : instruments deployed to date have focused on guiding product choice ( through ecolabelling and other product information ) and changing behaviour relating to energy saving , waste disposal and personal mobility ( through education , information and pricing signals ) .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .

To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
It is anticipated that the implementation of this programme will lead to a greater understanding of the principles and objectives of the United Nations , as well as to the enhancement of its image as an effective Organization capable of carrying out the tasks mandated by the General Assembly and directed by the Secretary-General , and , above all , as an Organization capable of making substantive contributions to meet the needs of the peoples of the world and challenges posed by a rapidly changing international environment .  
The second objective is to facilitate the development of an analytic framework available to the region 's countries that can assist them in determining the public agenda on , among others , public safety , corruption , poverty and drug abuse , consistent with the economic and social policies required for changing production patterns with social equity .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .

In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .

One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
Drawing on the successful experiences of foreign countries , China has successively set up the four financial asset management companies of Xinda , Dongfang , Changcheng , and Huarong since last year .

Under the present circumstances wherein the contradiction between pastures and livestock has proved a predominant problem in a majority of pastoral areas in the region , we should no longer follow the old development road of a quantity expansion .

The present training revolution in the American military is primarily embodied in the use of information , simulation , network , and artificial intelligence technology , and the methods and process in changing training have enabled the troops to receive " full physical and mental " training in simulating the " combined man and machine environment " of real combat .

This decision is completely consistent with Bush 's line of thinking that we would do " whatever it took to defend Taiwan .

In the rapidly changing industrial society of today , where values are constantly changing , youths are especially ready and willing to accept all kinds of fresh things and events . With the addition of the all-pervasive modern mass media , it is only natural that young people should have concepts and ways of doing things which are different from those of their elders in the preceding generation .  
But the more rapidly changing East has faced greater challenges . Problems and achievements , the sweet and the bitter , have been mixed together like the coffee , cream , and sugar in a cup of instant coffee , and the boiling water poured on top has produced a fragrant but scalding concoction .

On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened .

On the tangible side , we must begin by changing modern domestic architecture . Builders should adopt the spirit of the traditional courtyard house and design residential developments that meet the needs of small families yet reflect the spirit of the extended family home .  
Hung Chia-li , a matchmaker at the I Hsuan Agency , says that some women deliberately " downgrade " themselves on their personal information cards , changing a master 's degree to a bachelor 's degree or a bureau chief position to a section head , because they 're afraid of scaring men off .

" But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
Doing away with stereotypes : As far as Chang Hsiao-hung is concerned , postmodern game stratagems , or as she terms it , " gender performance , " can lend feminism new vitality and allow it to adapt to complex , changing postmodern culture .

Her daring , unpredictable performance style is in fact a bench mark for breaking through the confines of the stereotypes of early feminism and opening up today 's feminism to the pursuit of individual needs .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers .

For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .

Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .

The rushing waters , small boats , astonishing mountains , dazzling cliffs , sparkling waterfalls , and colorful and rapidly changing skies have been a source of wonder and inspiration for literati and artists since ancient times . The area has been a major center of civilization in China , and was the birthplace of renowned patriot-poet Qu Yuan and the statesman Zhuge Liang , among many others . Above all , it has been the home of countless generations of ordinary Chinese who have made their living around the river .  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
At the beginning of the 1980s the political atmosphere began to loosen up . In society , consumer , environmental , women 's , labor and other movements rose up one after another , and yet education , like an impregnable fortress , remained unchanged . Looking back today , it appears that just as the various social movements started to die down , the educational-reform movement-as if having a delayed reaction to the changing times-took off full steam .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color .

As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals .

" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract .

Over the past half century , the dominant thinking in Taiwan has been " the economy comes first . " Today the government is changing tack , adopting " sustainable management .

With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home .

Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes .

Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas .

Lin .  
Li says that in Indonesia , where anti-Chinese sentiment is intense , the fact that Tzu Chi often lends a hand is gradually changing local attitudes toward Chinese .

For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet .

The established publication and distribution mechanism could n't keep up with the needs of the market or with the changing face of the industry . Now the mainland publishing industry is overburdened upstream and overwhelmed downstream : the production of published works is like a torrential river rushing to the ocean-but on reaching the estuary ( distribution channels ) , it can do no more than trickle in . Some merges into the " second channel , " while the rest overflows everywhere , unable to smoothly enter the ocean that is the literary market .

The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .

In any case , the possibility of changing this criterion should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject , in the light of experiences where nationality has been used to mask the mercenary nature of illicit activities engaged in by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population .  
On a strategic and policy level , the Union 's supreme organ , the Plenipotentiary Conference , meeting at Kyoto in October 1994 , set out its strategic plan for 1995-1999 in resolution 1 of which it considers the subject in the context of the rapidly changing telecommunication environment under three broad headings : restructuring of the telecommunication sector , technological convergence , and globalization .

The Forum believed this statement sets out clear visionary but achievable goals , based on its members ' many shared interests and building on the Forum 's tradition of close regional consultation , which would significantly strengthen the region 's capacity to adapt to a rapidly changing international and regional environment .  
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
The continuing plundering of the cultural heritage of the Greek Cypriots and the changing demographic structure of the area under Turkish military occupation through massive importation of settlers were two additional characteristics of the unacceptable situation created in Cyprus through the force of arms .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies . 
Mr . N'DOW ( Assistant Secretary-General , United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) ) , speaking also in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , said that the changing global political , economic and social environment required that Governments and multilateral organizations adjust development strategies to meet the needs of a transformed world .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
Among the economic and social factors influencing this process are population growth and voluntary and involuntary migration , real and perceived employment opportunities , cultural expectations , changing consumption and production patterns and serious imbalances and disparities among regions . 
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
A wide variety of approaches are currently being used : instruments deployed to date have focused on guiding product choice ( through ecolabelling and other product information ) and changing behaviour relating to energy saving , waste disposal and personal mobility ( through education , information and pricing signals ) .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .

To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
It is anticipated that the implementation of this programme will lead to a greater understanding of the principles and objectives of the United Nations , as well as to the enhancement of its image as an effective Organization capable of carrying out the tasks mandated by the General Assembly and directed by the Secretary-General , and , above all , as an Organization capable of making substantive contributions to meet the needs of the peoples of the world and challenges posed by a rapidly changing international environment .  
The second objective is to facilitate the development of an analytic framework available to the region 's countries that can assist them in determining the public agenda on , among others , public safety , corruption , poverty and drug abuse , consistent with the economic and social policies required for changing production patterns with social equity .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .

In addition , price measures might suffer from a number of practical problems : the changing nature of output and the increased heterogeneity of products made it very difficult to compile consistent price measures over time ; service industry outputs were notoriously difficult to define and to price ; and measuring the price of governmental outputs presented major conceptual problems .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
IMIS is progressively replacing the numerous independent systems , many of which , built many years ago and mostly for regular budget activities , are no longer able to provide the support needed by management at a time of rapidly changing needs and increasing demands made on the administrative sector to support extensive peacekeeping activities and those financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .
